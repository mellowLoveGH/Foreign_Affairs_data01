0,Las Décadas Perdidas de América Latina,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/south-america/2020-12-22/las-decadas-perdidas-de-america-latina,Las Décadas Perdidas de América Latina,"En los albores de la pandemia del coronavirus, allá por marzo del 2020, la ciudad de Guayaquil, capital económica de Ecuador y hogar de unas tres millones de personas, estaba en serios problemas. Por un giro del destino, más de 20.000 de sus habitantes acababan de regresar de sus vacaciones en el extranjero. Muchos habían llegado de Italia y España, dos de los principales focos del COVID-19 en Europa, donde se registraron los primeros y más mortíferos brotes de la enfermedad. El presidente ecuatoriano, Lenín Moreno, sabía que la amenaza era grave, pero inicialmente optó por no cerrar los aeropuertos del país. En cambio, le pidió a los viajeros que retornaban que se aislaran en sus casas. ""Si la gente hace su parte, creo que podemos controlarlo"", me comentó en su momento."
1,The End of the Wilsonian Era,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2020-12-08/end-wilsonian-era,The End of the Wilsonian Era,"One hundred years after the U.S. Senate humiliated President Woodrow Wilson by rejecting the Treaty of Versailles, Princeton University, which Wilson led as its president before launching his political career, struck his name from its famous school of international affairs. As “cancellations” go, this one is at least arguably deserved. Wilson was an egregious racist even by the standards of his time, and the man behind the persecution of his own political opponents and the abuses of the first Red Scare has been celebrated for far too long and far too uncritically."
2,The Reconstruction of America,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2020-12-08/reconstruction-america,The Reconstruction of America,"In 1882, Walt Whitman, the American poet of democracy and nearly everything else in the human spirit, worried that his book Specimen Days, compiled from jottings, diaries, and memorandums written during and after the Civil War, would be read as nothing but a “batch of convulsively written reminiscences.” But he decided to publish it anyway. The writings were “but parts of the actual distraction, heat, smoke and excitement of those times,” Whitman admitted. “The war itself, with the temper of society preceding it, can indeed be best described by that very word convulsiveness.”"
3,The World China Wants,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2020-12-08/world-china-wants,The World China Wants,"Does China want to transform the global order to advance its own interests and to reflect its own image? That may be the most important question in geopolitics today, yet the answers it elicits tend to reveal more about modern biases than they do about what a future Chinese superpower would look like. Those who want to project forward to a malevolent, expansionist China point to evidence of aggression in Beijing’s posture today. Those with a less apocalyptic view highlight more accommodating features in Chinese policy or note that China will face plenty of challenges that will keep it from reshaping the world even if it wants to. Many Western observers see a burgeoning new Cold War, with China serving as a twenty-first-century version of the Soviet Union."
4,"The Compatriots: The Brutal and Chaotic History of Russia’s Exiles, Émigrés, and Agents Abroad",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/compatriots-brutal-and-chaotic-history-russias-exiles-emigres-and-agents,"The Compatriots: The Brutal and Chaotic History of Russia’s Exiles, Émigrés, and Agents Abroad","The early Soviet government sent its agents abroad to trace and murder Russian political fugitives, including prominent figures of the anti-Bolshevik White movement defeated in the civil war and revolutionaries who fell afoul of the Bolsheviks—most notably Leon Trotsky, who was killed in Mexico City in 1940. But some émigrés served Soviet interests. For instance, many Russian Jews who had fled pogroms in tsarist Russia often sympathized with communist ideas and were easily recruited to become Soviet spies. The authors, both journalists, draw on historical material and their own extensive reporting to show how governments in Moscow from the early Bolsheviks to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s Kremlin have treated Russian emigration as both a threat and an opportunity. They chronicle Putin’s efforts to build a patriotic diaspora that would advance his government’s interests in the West. Political émigrés who engage in anti-Kremlin lobbying abroad, the authors argue, may risk an attack on their lives, similar to the earlier Bolshevik ones. The authors’ emphasis on the sinister continuity of the methods used by the Russian secret police may seem a bit overdone, but the poisoning (less than a year after the book’s publication) of the Kremlin’s most vocal and fearless critic, Alexei Navalny, provides strong backing for their argument."
5,The Lenin Plot: The Unknown Story of America’s War Against Russia,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/lenin-plot-unknown-story-americas-war-against-russia,The Lenin Plot: The Unknown Story of America’s War Against Russia,"Soon after the 1917 Russian Revolution, the Bolshevik leader Vladimir Lenin made peace with Germany and in so doing turned Russia into an existential enemy of Western powers and a traitor to the World War I anti-German alliance. France, the United Kingdom, and the United States intervened with the intention of overthrowing the Bolshevik government and plotted to kill Lenin and his main associates. Carr’s account reads like a thriller—as Western spies conspire with reckless adventurers and professional Russian terrorists—set against the backdrop of a tumultuous period, with Russia racked by civil war, violence, starvation, and epidemics. Leftist radicals assassinated the German ambassador inside his Moscow embassy in 1918, the same year Bolsheviks murdered the tsar’s family in the Urals. Lenin survived an attempt on his life, an attack that was probably unrelated to Western plans to kill him. The Western plot came to an end after the Cheka, the Bolshevik security police, infiltrated the ranks of the plotters and arrested many of its members. In 1921, in return for U.S. aid, the Bolshevik government handed over 100 Americans who were involved in this futile bid to snuff out the Soviet Union in its infancy."
6,"Politics for Profit: Business, Elections, and Policymaking in Russia",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/politics-profit-business-elections-and-policymaking-russia,"Politics for Profit: Business, Elections, and Policymaking in Russia","Businesspeople commonly rely on lobbying or making campaign contributions to win favorable policies from governments. But in states with weaker political institutions, politicians tend to renege on their promises. This may drive businesspeople to run for office themselves, despite the high costs required for winning and holding elected offices and the risk of unwanted public attention. Szakonyi’s work of political economy studies Russian businesspeople who seek elected positions in regional legislatures. Only larger and wealthier firms can afford the high costs of winning elections. Competition motivates some businesspeople; if an executive from a firm’s rival runs for office, then that firm must also seek to place its own “in-house lobbyist” in the legislature. Szakonyi identifies the advantages companies gain by participating in local politics: firms connected to winning candidates significantly increase their revenue and profit margins. Not surprisingly, these businesspeople turned legislators pursue pro-business policies that evince little concern for the needs of ordinary citizens, such as health care or education. The author draws on a broad range of data, including numerous interviews with regional businesspeople. His rigorous scientific methods complement an enjoyable and convincing narrative."
7,Moscow Monumental: Soviet Skyscrapers and Urban Life in Stalin’s Capital,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/moscow-monumental-soviet-skyscrapers-and-urban-life-stalins-capital,Moscow Monumental: Soviet Skyscrapers and Urban Life in Stalin’s Capital,"After World War II, the Soviet leader Joseph Stalin ordered Moscow to be reinvented as “the capital of all capitals.” Zubovich’s fascinating history of skyscrapers in Moscow goes far beyond architectural design and looks at the social and political ramifications of Stalin’s monument building. These structures were conceived as symbols of the Soviet Union’s postwar might and self-confidence. In order to clear sites for the construction of the skyscrapers, authorities resettled tens of thousands of Muscovites in hastily built housing in the city’s barren outskirts. The labor force mobilized to erect the vysotki (high-rises) included construction workers from across the Soviet Union, as well as many thousands of prisoners from the gulag. Once completed, the vysotki laid bare late-Stalinist social hierarchies: in a city of acute housing shortages, the comfortable apartments in the skyscrapers were reserved exclusively for artistic, academic, and government elites. After Stalin’s death, the vysotki became a target of his successor Nikita Khrushchev’s de-Stalinization efforts. The new Soviet leader, who soon launched a nationwide housing program, harshly criticized Stalin’s monumental building efforts for their disregard for building costs, their complete neglect of the population’s urgent housing needs, and the excessive embellishments of the skyscrapers themselves."
8,Two Books on Movements for Social Change in Latin America,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/two-books-movements-social-change-latin-america,Two Books on Movements for Social Change in Latin America,"Two books examine the recent history of movements for social change in Latin America. From the late 1990s until around 2015, voters in Latin America swept social democratic and national populist candidates into government—a trend known as “the pink tide.” More recently, voters in many countries have returned conservatives to power. In Balán and Montambeault’s timely collection, political scientists and sociologists (but no economists) seek to determine the extent to which left-leaning governments met their stated goals of economic redistribution, popular participation, and social inclusion. The record tends, not surprisingly, to be mixed in this increasingly heterogeneous region. The differences in performance between center-right and center-left governments in some areas are less pronounced than their mutual distance from more radical, populist governments (such as those that have ruled Bolivia, Ecuador, and Venezuela). Given the inflated expectations and the many constraints that reformers faced (powerful vested interests, weak state capacity, and punishing global markets), these governments would seem to have been preordained to disappoint the authors. But the contributors pay insufficient attention to why voters abandoned the left. When the pendulum swings back again (as has already occurred in Bolivia), social reformers will want to avoid repeating the same mistakes."
9,Lula and His Politics of Cunning: From Metalworker to President of Brazil,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/lula-and-his-politics-cunning-metalworker-president-brazil,Lula and His Politics of Cunning: From Metalworker to President of Brazil,"A longtime observer of Brazilian labor organizations, French delivers an immersive and broadly laudatory biography of former Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, whom U.S. President Barack Obama once hailed as “the most popular politician on earth.” French adroitly traces Lula’s beginnings as an impoverished rural migrant in industrializing São Paulo, where he became a skilled metalworker, and then his evolution into a determined trade union leader, a savvy negotiator, and, ultimately, a powerful orator and dominant politician. Lula is a genuinely self-made man, gregarious and hard-working, at once studious and intuitive. As a politician, he retained his authenticity as the plain-speaking, fearless voice of Brazilian workers seeking upward social mobility. French attributes Lula’s charisma to his embodiment of the collective identity of organized workers. He defines Lula’s cunning as the underdog’s crafty manipulation of social hierarchies. But French notes approvingly that Lula kept his distance from the intellectual Marxist left; a pragmatic Lula sought simply to make capitalism more egalitarian. French mocks the politically motivated post-presidency imprisonment of Lula, and he bemoans the ouster in 2016 of Lula’s handpicked successor, Dilma Rousseff, by an unscrupulous parliamentary coup organized by the old-line establishment, which paved the way for the presidency of the reactionary Jair Bolsonaro."
10,South to Freedom: Runaway Slaves to Mexico and the Road to the Civil War,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/south-freedom-runaway-slaves-mexico-and-road-civil-war,South to Freedom: Runaway Slaves to Mexico and the Road to the Civil War,"Baumgartner is a rising star in an emerging generation of historians who focus on the social forces underlying political conflict. Their narratives tend to be less interested in conquering generals than in humble rebels, and their analyses transcend national borders to reveal wider dramas. Baumgartner links the antebellum conflicts between Mexico and Texas—and eventually the United States—to the question of slavery. She reverses the contemporary narrative that assumes U.S. norms and institutions are superior: in the mid-nineteenth century, Mexico was a safe haven for fugitives fleeing oppression, and the Mexican constitution was more consistent in defending universal rights than were U.S. laws. Mexico destabilized the American South when it outlawed slavery in 1829, encouraging runaway slaves to flee southward. New antislavery “free-soil” states in the American Southwest carved out of Mexico after the Mexican-American War threatened southern power in the U.S. Congress. Baumgartner points out that the Texan defenders of the Alamo were at least as intent on protecting their right to own slaves from Mexican abolitionists as they were on safeguarding their own liberty. As ideologies transcended borders, the great secular, liberal Mexican reformer and eventual president Benito Juárez and U.S. President Abraham Lincoln negotiated an extradition treaty in 1861 that explicitly prohibited the return of fugitive slaves."
11,Beethoven: A Life in Nine Pieces,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/beethoven-life-nine-pieces,Beethoven: A Life in Nine Pieces,"Were it not for COVID-19, audiences in concert halls across the globe would have spent 2020 celebrating the 250th birthday of Ludwig van Beethoven—the most famous composer in the Western canon. Over the nearly two centuries since his death, many great books on the man and his music have appeared, telling readers nearly everything that can be known. This short, popular introduction takes a fresh approach. It portrays the man’s life through nine of his compositions. They span from his Septet, an early work with engaging and popular tunes, to the gnarly Grosse Fuge for string quartet, a late work that lay unrecognized as a masterpiece for a generation. Tunbridge highlights Beethoven’s genius by contrasting it with the prosaic details of an everyday life beset with financial worries, family crises, political squabbles, and loneliness. Her portrait is in no way original or comprehensive, but she succeeds in stripping Beethoven of the romantic exaggerations of him as a penurious, entirely deaf, politically revolutionary, curmudgeonly misanthrope. As a result, this biography leads readers back to Beethoven’s timeless music."
12,"The Neoliberal Republic: Corporate Lawyer, Statecraft, and the Making of Public-Private France",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/neoliberal-republic-corporate-lawyer-statecraft-and-making-public-private,"The Neoliberal Republic: Corporate Lawyer, Statecraft, and the Making of Public-Private France","French President Emmanuel Macron rose to prominence in politics quickly by moving back and forth between the public and the private sector. A graduate of the prestigious civil service training school known as the ENA, he worked first in the French Finance Ministry and then for Rothschild & Co., before becoming a government official, a minister, and then president in 2017. The authors argue that this is a career imaginable in France only in the last few decades, as the country has lowered barriers between the state and business. This shift has led to a flourishing of “in-and-outers”: top officials—few in number but high in prestige—who leave state service to work for private companies and corporate law firms as lobbyists, experts, and arbiters. Vauchez and France document who these people are and criticize their role in undermining effective democratic control. Their analysis, however, lacks concrete examples of how exactly in-and-outers have harmed the public interest. The authors nonetheless close by recommending greater transparency and stronger conflict-of-interest laws, as one finds in other advanced democracies faced with the same phenomenon."
13,"Collateral Damage: Britain, America, and Europe in the Age of Trump",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/collateral-damage-britain-america-and-europe-age-trump,"Collateral Damage: Britain, America, and Europe in the Age of Trump","Darroch was the most successful British diplomat of his generation. A middling graduate in zoology from a regional university, he entered the Foreign Office with no special promise. Yet he rose to serve as a top adviser to Prime Minister Tony Blair, permanent representative to the European Union, national security adviser to Prime Minister David Cameron, and, finally, the British ambassador in Washington. But in 2019, his 40-year career ended abruptly when someone (probably a colleague in London) leaked one of his top-secret reports. It described U.S. President Donald Trump as “dysfunctional . . . clumsy and inept.” Trump responded by tweeting, “We will no longer deal with him,” and the Conservative politician Boris Johnson—at the time in a fight for leadership of his party and likely seeking to distinguish himself from other aspirants—refused to support Darroch. This book confirms what many in the foreign policy community know from personal experience: the author is reasonable, generous, and discreet. These are laudable qualities in a diplomat but lamentable in a writer of memoirs. Beyond a short accounting of his time in Washington, amusing depictions of the demeaning ways in which diplomats scramble for access, and a brief description of how inequality, immigration, and identity fueled the parallel rises of Trump and Johnson, one searches in vain in these pages for fresh insights or inside information about this tumultuous period."
14,Boris Johnson: The Gambler,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2020-12-08/boris-johnson-gambler,Boris Johnson: The Gambler,"In today’s media-obsessed world, many politicians publicly flaunt narcissistic personal habits, lie openly about important issues, shift their fundamental principles to fit the moment, tailor their actions to build a personal brand rather than a political legacy, and hire subordinates more for loyalty than expertise. This book illustrates these trends by tracing the life of British Prime Minister Boris Johnson. The author, an investigative journalist, churned out nearly 600 pages within a year, so perhaps it would be unfair to expect the most accurate, scrupulously documented, nuanced, or well-written biography of Johnson in print. It is none of those things. But it is the newest recounting of the prime minister’s life, taking the reader all the way up through July 2020—well into the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the book’s sometimes compulsive effort to document both sides of every judgment, Johnson emerges as the stereotypical rich boy from a privileged background. He is a compulsive gambler who repeatedly jeopardizes his jobs, marriages, and future prospects through sloppy, lazy, and risky behavior—and each time is saved by his charm, luck, ambition, and connections. His is a life for our times."
15,Monopoly Versus Democracy,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2020-12-08/monopoly-versus-democracy,Monopoly Versus Democracy,"The so-called Gilded Age in the United States began with the Compromise of 1877, which settled the disputed presidential election of 1876 by awarding the White House to the Republican candidate, Rutherford B. Hayes, in exchange for the withdrawal of federal troops from three Southern states. In the short term, the compromise effectively ended Reconstruction. In the longer term, it empowered white terrorists in the South and led to a major realignment in U.S. politics that weakened the federal government’s ability to govern the “Money Power,” the term used by critics at the time to describe the forces that were steadily taking over markets and political systems."
16,Cleaning House,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2020-12-08/cleaning-house,Cleaning House,"On the morning of August 9, 1974, Richard Nixon signed a statement that no American leader had ever before written: “I hereby resign the Office of President of the United States.” Nixon then walked out to the South Lawn of the White House, boarded the presidential helicopter, and flashed an incongruous victory sign with both hands, bidding farewell to his staff and to the American people."
17,The Spanish Miracle,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/review-essay/2020-12-08/spanish-miracle,The Spanish Miracle,"Nearly three decades have passed since the 1991 publication of the political scientist Samuel Huntington’s The Third Wave, the most important scholarly take on the global democratic transformation that took place in the late twentieth century. The book traced democratic openings around the world, beginning with the 1974 Carnation Revolution in Portugal, which ended the West’s longest dictatorship, and concluding with the democratization of eastern Europe following the collapse of communism and the disintegration of the Soviet Union. Between those two landmark events, nearly 30 new democracies emerged."
18,The Meddlers,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/review-essay/2020-12-08/meddlers,The Meddlers,"In 1864, the Russian poet Fyodor Tyutchev wrote that “Russia’s only natural policy toward the West must be to seek not an alliance with the Western powers but their disunity and division.” In the decades that followed, Russian and Soviet leaders heeded that advice. A century and a half later, the United States is still grappling with the aftermath of Russia’s attempts to amplify and benefit from divisions within American society during the 2016 U.S. presidential election campaign. As a result of that interference, which Moscow reprised to a lesser extent in the 2020 campaign, Russia has become a toxic issue in American politics, to a degree not seen since the McCarthy era."
19,"Desperate Times, Desperate Measures",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2020-12-08/desperate-times-desperate-measures,"Desperate Times, Desperate Measures","In the summer of 1932, in the depths of the Great Depression, Franklin Roosevelt flew to Chicago to accept the Democratic Party’s nomination for president. His campaign theme song, “Happy Days Are Here Again,” rang out in the arena where the convention was being held, but few there would have agreed with the song’s chirpy lyrics: “The skies above are clear again.” One in four Americans was out of work, and millions more were enduring wage cuts. Hundreds of thousands were homeless. Disease was on the rise, especially in African American communities, where the prevalence of tuberculosis was five times as high as it was in white communities. Mob violence was spiking, too, with Black men and labor organizers the most frequent victims. In his acceptance speech at the convention, Roosevelt, then governor of New York, promised a way out of the national crisis—“a new deal for the American people.”"
20,"The Value of Disorder: Autonomy, Prosperity, and Plunder in the Chadian Sahara",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/value-disorder-autonomy-prosperity-and-plunder-chadian-sahara,"The Value of Disorder: Autonomy, Prosperity, and Plunder in the Chadian Sahara","Faya-Largeau is an oasis town in northern Chad of maybe 25,000 inhabitants, around 700 miles from the capital, N’Djamena. But it has played an outsize role in the country’s turbulent past. It was the site of repeated fighting between Chad and Libya from 1975 to 1987, and the last three presidents of the country have all had familial links to either the town or its dominant ethnic group, the Toubous. Brachet and Scheele spent a year in Faya-Largeau and have produced a careful ethnography of its people. Northern Chad is both desperately poor and an area of long-standing commerce, as well as banditry and violence. The authors argue that Toubou identity has been shaped by this context of transience and instability, although they also claim that that identity is performative, shaped by how the Toubous interpret and act on the reputation they think they have in the outside world. The authors additionally contend that the central state’s long-standing inability to exercise power and control over Toubou territory stems is in large part from the Toubous’ view that the government has no legitimacy."
21,Digital Entrepreneurship in Africa: How a Continent Is Escaping Silicon Valley’s Long Shadow,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2020-12-08/digital-entrepreneurship-africa-how-continent-escaping-silicon,Digital Entrepreneurship in Africa: How a Continent Is Escaping Silicon Valley’s Long Shadow,"This comprehensive and carefully argued review of digital entrepreneurship in Africa provides an eye-opening assessment of the possibilities for and limits of this sector’s future in the region. Based on interviews with some 143 Internet entrepreneurs and careful case-study work in 11 African cities in as many countries, the book suggests that African countries are a long way away from playing a major role in digital technology. As the authors point out, Africa’s share of the world’s population is about 13 percent, and the continent has about eight percent of the world’s Internet users, but it still accounts for only 0.7 percent of domain registrations and is actually further behind in digital production than in more traditional forms of knowledge production. Moreover, just three countries (Kenya, Nigeria, and South Africa) provide most of the continent’s digital entrepreneurship. The book underscores the fact that although the digital revolution has benefited some African firms, investment and market opportunities remain limited by longstanding constraints and economic realities, such as tiny and poor local markets. Indeed, the overwhelming majority of the firms they examine have succeeded not by attempting to compete in the global digital marketplace but by adapting international technologies to local realities."
22,Shaping the Future of Power: Knowledge Production and Network-Building in China-Africa Relations,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2020-12-08/shaping-future-power-knowledge-production-and-network-building,Shaping the Future of Power: Knowledge Production and Network-Building in China-Africa Relations,"Benabdallah argues that Chinese policy toward Africa reveals a new approach to international relations that emphasizes the construction of social networks and knowledge production as means to build close bilateral ties. She provides impressive evidence of the multiple ways China has developed these networks, including through thousands of workshops for Africans in China and a large number of high-level visits by Chinese officials to the African continent. Readers will no doubt be skeptical of the book’s contention that China’s diplomatic outreach is truly novel, but they will be intrigued by the numerous examples of Chinese efforts to forge complex networks of influence throughout the region to advance Beijing’s own version of soft power, including through the establishment of Confucius Institutes at universities across Africa. Benabdallah also provides a useful corrective to the common tendency in the West to view Chinese diplomacy in Africa exclusively through the prism of commercial ambitions and natural resource extraction."
23,Constraining Dictatorship: From Personalized Rule to Institutionalized Regimes,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2020-12-08/constraining-dictatorship-personalized-rule-institutionalized,Constraining Dictatorship: From Personalized Rule to Institutionalized Regimes,"Some authoritarian regimes are personalistic, organized around a single dictator and with few strong formal checks on executive power. Others are institutional: power is embedded in a set of institutions that makes the executive accountable to other top political elites. In this innovative and informative book, Meng asks why some regimes manage to become more institutionalized and how this shift affects their political stability. She defines institutions as political procedures and rules that explicitly limit executive authority and give at least some power to other figures within the regime. Such procedures include term limits, succession rules, and influential offices such as the vice presidency. Meng draws on data from 46 countries in Africa to show that, counterintuitively, authoritarian regimes in which the ruler’s power is constrained by institutions in fact last longer and that those rulers are more likely to die a natural death (rather than at the hands of a political rival). By contrast, the regimes of less constrained dictators rarely survive them, plunging their countries back into instability."
24,Idi Amin: The Story of Africa’s Icon of Evil,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2020-12-08/idi-amin-story-africas-icon-evil,Idi Amin: The Story of Africa’s Icon of Evil,"This biography of the Ugandan dictator Idi Amin sifts through the many myths and fictitious claims that have long shaped public understanding of his early life and his later rule as president of Uganda from 1971 to 1979. In so doing, it reaches a more nuanced assessment of the man than previously available. Born around 1925 in Koboko, in the northwestern hinterlands of British-controlled Uganda, Amin rose through the ranks of the British colonial army despite possessing only a rudimentary formal education. He proved adept enough at navigating complex ethnic politics to end up as head of the Ugandan army in 1965, just three years after the country won its independence from the United Kingdom. When his alliance with President Milton Obote soured, he orchestrated a coup. Amin’s rule saw significant political repression and the ruthless assassination of political opponents, as well as disastrous economic policies and erratic swings in international diplomacy that would lead the United Kingdom and the United States to terminate diplomatic relations with Uganda. Amin was deposed following the mutiny of his army and a Tanzanian invasion. Leopold’s narrative is sometimes repetitive but well informed and suitably skeptical of the entirely monstrous image that has long surrounded the dictator. After all, Leopold points out, the dour Obote, who is today mostly unknown in the West, would return to power in 1980 and be responsible for even greater political repression and more civilian deaths."

Vol. 1, 1893– 1949","One wonders why a prestigious university press decided to publish a three-volume work on the late Chinese leader Mao Zedong by official Chinese historians. The respected scholar Timothy Cheek validates the project in reserved terms in his thoughtful introduction, acknowledging, “For most scholars, Jin Chongji’s unrelentingly positive assessment of Mao is unlikely to convince.” By tracing Mao’s movements in numbing detail up to the founding of the People’s Republic of China in October 1949, this first volume does provide many fresh facts from China’s closed archives, as Cheek says. And for what it’s worth, it faithfully reflects the current official Chinese interpretation of Mao’s life, which no longer treats him as a god but does not delve into his humanity. Episodes of factional strife are described as Mao’s patient, infallible rectification of internal discord. The violence against critics between 1942 and 1945, during the Yan’an period, is attributed not to Mao but to Kang Sheng, the chief of Mao’s secret police. Mao’s complex love-hate relationship with Stalin fades into rote formality. Mao’s affair with his eventual fourth wife, Jiang Qing, merits a mere three sentences. Only specialists will have the patience to pan for the specks of gold that this first volume contains, and they might as well consult the Chinese edition."
26,China Goes Green: Coercive Environmentalism for a Troubled Planet,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2020-12-08/china-goes-green-coercive-environmentalism-troubled-planet,China Goes Green: Coercive Environmentalism for a Troubled Planet,"It is tempting to hold out China’s environmental record as a reason for optimism. The country is expanding its use of renewable energy, creating state parks, planting massive numbers of trees, and curbing the global trade in endangered species. But Li and Shapiro ring some alarm bells. The government pursues its environmental goals with the authoritarian tools it has available: mandatory targets, mass campaigns, top-down bans, factory closures, forced relocations, and even household trash inspectors who can ticket offenders. These efforts sometimes produce counterproductive results, such as desertification and ecosystem disruption. China’s overseas projects often damage the environment as well. The authors argue that coercive enforcement makes the system even more authoritarian than it already is, stifling the cooperation with civil society that alone can make environmentalism effective. But they acknowledge that so far, Western capitalist systems are not doing any better."
27,Anti-Christian Violence in India,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2020-12-08/anti-christian-violence-india,Anti-Christian Violence in India,"Bauman enters deeply into the thinking of Hindu nationalists to show that their acts of violence against Christians are motivated not by disputes over doctrine but by an even more basic clash over the role of religion. In the eyes of Hindu nationalists, Hinduism is not a universal creed but a particularistic identity and way of life. They see Christians as the bearers of a foreign, individualistic culture who seek to undermine Indian identity by converting nonbelievers to their faith. Bauman acknowledges that material and political interests also help motivate the violence. For example, most Christian converts are Dalits who are looking for a way out of their disadvantaged status in the caste system. But a major driver of the violence is the scapegoating of Christians for the damage that globalization is doing to traditional values. One wishes that Bauman had considered whether his analysis could also help explain anti-Muslim violence in India and anti-Christian violence in other parts of the world."
28,Prisoners of the Empire: Inside Japanese POW Camps,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2020-12-08/prisoners-empire-inside-japanese-pow-camps,Prisoners of the Empire: Inside Japanese POW Camps,"This innovative study of Japanese prisoner-of-war (POW) camps in Japan, Korea, the Philippines, and Singapore during World War II explores how they were administered and what the prisoners experienced. Many prisoners were transported thousands of miles in crowded ships to work in construction, factories, and mines. The horror stories about camp conditions, forced labor, soaring death rates, and “hell ships” are painful to read. But Kovner attributes these gruesome events not to some inherent inhumanity in Japanese culture (a stereotype that remains influential) but to Japan’s lack of material resources and administrative capacity as it struggled to defend a vast new empire. Japanese administrators often tried to apply the provisions of the 1929 Geneva Convention regarding POWs to Americans, Australians, and Europeans, although they did not consider Asian captives to be protected by POW status. Kovner’s vivid, detailed inquiry throws light on a host of subjects, including the racial and gender attitudes of the many cultures that encountered one another in wartime Asia."
29,The Koreas: The Birth of Two Nations Divided,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2020-12-08/koreas-birth-two-nations-divided,The Koreas: The Birth of Two Nations Divided,"Yoo brings both clarity and nuance to the complex, interwoven histories of the two Koreas since 1945. He places individual stories against the backdrop of economic, social, political, business, and cultural trends. As Yoo traces North Korea’s path from wartime devastation in the 1950s to industrialization and then to famine, stagnation, and its current diplomatic isolation, he also explores the North Korean leader Kim Jong Il’s amateur filmmaking, a North Korean–born sumo wrestler who hides his identity to avoid discrimination in Japan, and a North Korean spy successfully masquerading in South Korea as an Arab of Filipino Lebanese descent. The book is especially strong on South Korea, covering not only political and economic developments but also the outflow of children for adoption in the 1950s and 1960s, the sociology of sex workers catering to American troops and Japanese tourists, urban planning, the feminist movement, movies, and fiction. Yoo introduces better-known figures, such as the artist Nam June Paik and the religious leader Sun Myung Moon, as well as lesser-known but equally vivid characters. South Korea has become the most wired society in the world, Asia’s dominant cultural influencer, and surely one of the most stressed-out developed countries, with the most cosmetic surgeries and suicides per capita. Although the main lines of contemporary Korean history are familiar, even specialists will learn a lot from this book."
30,Protection Without Protectionism,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2020-12-08/protection-without-protectionism,Protection Without Protectionism,"For two decades, the free movement of goods, services, and capital was the world’s guiding principle, crystallized in the so-called Washington consensus. Although countries didn’t always live up to these ideals or implement laissez-faire policies, most aspired to do so. They had to explain, justify, and limit their deviations from this consensus, at least in theory. The vast majority of the world’s countries signed on to multilateral institutions that promoted and enforced this view—such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Trade Organization (WTO)."
31,Two Books on Chinese Influence,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2020-12-08/two-books-chinese-influence,Two Books on Chinese Influence,"China’s expanding global influence is spearheaded by what Beijing claims is $1 trillion worth of investments in roads, railways, cyber-infrastructure, oil fields, mines, and more, in an estimated 1,700 projects in at least 130 countries. Most of the projects are clustered under the imposing strategic vision known as the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), which seeks to tie other economies more closely to China’s. Pushing in behind the investment beachheads are Chinese diplomats, peacekeepers, security contractors, shopkeepers, media enterprises, training and exchange programs, and many other forms of influence. These valuable books focus on the many forms of resistance that China is encountering as its influence expands. China had to renegotiate the terms of construction contracts when power flipped between rival parties in Argentina, Malaysia, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka, among other countries. In Kenya and Malaysia, politicians who signed loan contracts were later prosecuted for corruption. In South Sudan, weapons China sold to the government found their way into the hands of rebels who attacked Chinese oil installations. Europeans have accused Chinese dealmakers of unfair competition and highhanded diplomacy. African governments complained of listening devices planted in Chinese-donated buildings. Many countries have played China off against rival donors, including India, Japan, Russia, and the United States. Governments elsewhere have griped about the low quality of Chinese construction work and the high debt incurred through contracts with Beijing. Patey argues that pushback against China stems from the stifling effect of Chinese competition on local businesses and the fear of Chinese leverage over host countries’ foreign and defense policies. Hillman emphasizes that big infrastructure projects are hard to build on time and on budget, tend to cause environmental damage, spur local corruption, and often fail to make money. Patey’s book is more wide-ranging geographically, whereas Hillman’s usefully compares the BRI to historic empires and other countries’ development aid programs. Both authors note the lack of coordination among Chinese agencies and firms involved in the BRI, and the failure of these disparate projects scattered around the world to fuse into a cohesive network that links back to China. Still, money talks, and for the time being, no other country offers as much of it as China does. If China learns from its mistakes, it could become what Hillman calls “the most central node in the global flows of goods, data, and people,” with the power to set technical standards for everything from railways to wireless technology and to export its political values around the world. Patey’s view of China’s long-term goals is even more expansive: he warns that China seeks to “displace the United States as the world’s superpower.”"
32,Latin America’s Lost Decades,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/south-america/2020-12-08/latin-americas-lost-decades,Latin America’s Lost Decades,"During the early days of the coronavirus pandemic, in March 2020, Guayaquil, Ecuador’s business capital of some three million people, was in trouble. By a twist of fate, more than 20,000 Ecuadorians had just returned home from their seasonal vacations. Many had come from Italy and Spain, two coronavirus hot spots, with the earliest and most deadly outbreaks of COVID-19. President Lenín Moreno understood that the threat was serious but opted, at first, not to close the country’s airports, instead asking the returning travelers to self-isolate at home. “If people do their part, I think we can control this,” he told me at the time."
33,When Blame Backfires: Syrian Refugees and Citizen Grievances in Jordan and Lebanon,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2020-12-08/when-blame-backfires-syrian-refugees-and-citizen-grievances,When Blame Backfires: Syrian Refugees and Citizen Grievances in Jordan and Lebanon,"The plight of refugees from Syria has received much attention since the country descended into civil war in 2011. Although many western Europeans have taken a humanitarian interest in the refugees, their governments have been less keen to accept large inflows of people fleeing the war. As a result, Syria’s neighbors Jordan and Lebanon host the highest number of Syrian refugees—and indeed, per capita, they host the most refugees in the world. Both Amman and Beirut have received substantial international aid in support of these refugees; cynics suggest that the refugees serve as yet another source of government rent. Baylouny delves into how ordinary Jordanian and Lebanese citizens perceive the influx, as they face more competition over already scarce water, housing, electricity, and jobs. She provides a revealing and at times counterintuitive portrait of the nuanced ways that locals have responded to the newcomers. Resentment quickly overtook sympathy as the demand on local resources grew. But Jordanian and Lebanese citizens didn’t buy government efforts to shirk responsibility and blame the scarcity on the refugees themselves. On the contrary, in both Jordan and Lebanon, protests over the right of citizens to be served effectively by their governments undermined local regional and sectarian identities in favor of a more broadly national collective focused on making demands on the government. This shift may have far-reaching consequences for governments long accustomed to ruling by dividing diverse populations."
34,Paradigm Lost: From Two-State Solution to One-State Reality,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2020-12-08/paradigm-lost-two-state-solution-one-state-reality,Paradigm Lost: From Two-State Solution to One-State Reality,"Once a supporter of a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Lustick now deems that goal a deceptively Solomonic, and often disingenuous, approach to avoiding a “one-state reality.” In a series of connected essays, he examines the forces in Israeli history and politics that have contributed to the failure of the two-state solution, including the long-standing Zionist expectation that defeat would force Arab hands but require no concessions by Israel, a culture of profound mistrust of adversaries shaped by the legacy of the Holocaust, and U.S. indulgence of Israeli anxieties, which encouraged belligerence and discouraged compromise. Lustick argues that a paradigm shift—a change in the conceptual framework that guides policymakers and activists—is necessary, and he puts forward his case concisely, vigorously, and candidly. His argument is compelling: whatever promise it once held, the two-state solution is now dead. But in light of the continuing expansive ambitions of Israeli leadership and the simultaneous decay of vision and dynamism among the Palestinians, it is hard to know what exactly should replace the old paradigm."
35,Losing the Long Game: The False Promise of Regime Change in the Middle East,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2020-12-08/losing-long-game-false-promise-regime-change-middle-east,Losing the Long Game: The False Promise of Regime Change in the Middle East,"Gordon, a former White House coordinator for the Middle East, has written a book whose depiction of policymakers’ cheerful and carefree ignorance will have his readers wincing at virtually every page. Seven briskly told case studies— including the toppling of Iranian Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddeq in 1953, the invasion of Iraq in 2003, and the more recent indecisive opposition to the rule of Bashar al-Assad in Syria—brilliantly illustrate how repeated U.S. attempts at regime change in the Middle East have produced “no case of clear success, some catastrophic failures, and universally high costs and unintended consequences.” He attributes the inability to resist the temptation to meddle in the Middle East to Americans’ sunny, extraordinarily naive can-do optimism, and his list of lessons doesn’t feature many surprises: yes, clients do typically have their own interests, and regional spoilers do often thwart success. Readers would be well served if, in his future work, Gordon were to train his sights on the equally obtuse relationship the United States has had with its so-called clients in the region, many of whom show up repeatedly as the spoilers in these stories. After all, the U.S. record of backing regimes in the region—such as that in Saudi Arabia—does not seem to have been a rousing success, either."
36,"Genocide in Libya: Shar, a Hidden Colonial History",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2020-12-08/genocide-libya-shar-hidden-colonial-history,"Genocide in Libya: Shar, a Hidden Colonial History","Ahmida, a political scientist, was born and raised in eastern Libya, and he draws on a wealth of sources for this examination of the extraordinary history of attempted ethnic cleansing during Italy’s colonial rule of the country, which lasted from 1911 to 1943. He succeeds in revealing a long-obscured and gruesome past through the reminiscences of his own elderly relatives, the disciplined excavation of suppressed official archives, the interpretation of long-recited epic poetry, and the creative deployment of comparative histories of genocide, war, and imperialism. The Libyans referred to the traumatic experience of dispossession and detention in Italian concentration camps with the term shar, or “evil.” Ahmida evokes the German Jewish philosopher Hannah Arendt in his discussion of the varied facets of this evil, including the great powers’ indifference to Italy’s conduct in Libya and the callous appropriation of this history by the regime of Muammar al-Qaddafi. This slim, painful, and at times polemic volume is not for the faint of heart. Ahmida’s account is important, however, and should provoke consequential debates about the long, dark shadow of history in North Africa."
37,The Man Who Ran Washington: The Life and Times of James A. Baker III,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/man-who-ran-washington-life-and-times-james-baker-iii,The Man Who Ran Washington: The Life and Times of James A. Baker III,"The book’s title does not overstate the case. As chief of staff to two presidents, secretary of state, secretary of the treasury, and a five-time presidential campaign manager, James Baker was at the center of power in Washington for more than 25 years. A famously reserved individual, he took the risk of opening up to two talented journalists and scholars—granting 70 hours of personal interviews and full access to his papers, his family, and former aides and colleagues—and it has paid off handsomely. This is no hagiography, but with so much firsthand information to work with, the husband-and-wife team of authors gives Baker full rein to tell his own story, even when it is less than admirable. A sweeping history as well as an intimate biography, the book is also a fascinating study of how to acquire power in Washington and how to use it to maximum effect. Baker was a master of compromise and negotiation, crafting deals that left something for the loser while keeping a watchful eye on his personal ambition. The chapters covering Baker’s years at the State Department as the Berlin Wall fell, the Soviet Union collapsed, Germany reunified, and Iraq invaded Kuwait are particularly rich and a badly needed reminder of how much skilled diplomacy can achieve."
38,The Upswing: How America Came Together a Century Ago and How We Can Do It Again,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/upswing-how-america-came-together-century-ago-and-how-we-can-do-it-again,The Upswing: How America Came Together a Century Ago and How We Can Do It Again,"Perhaps Putnam’s most important book, this one begins with the observation that the United States today closely mirrors the Gilded Age of the late nineteenth century—a time of deep political divisions, mistrust and cynicism, enormous economic inequality, racial segregation, corporate monopolies, and cultural narcissism. Spurred by the Progressive movement, the country then embarked on momentous reforms that in the seven decades that followed pushed American society in a more communitarian and less individualistic direction. In the middle of the 1960s, these economic, political, and social trends suddenly reversed, setting in motion a steep societal decline that continues today. The authors call the arc of this history the “I-we-I” curve and hope for another upswing now. There are countless stirring insights in this book. Putnam and Romney Garrett range with ease across history, political science, economics, and social science, distilling masses of complex data into simple graphs that are integrated seamlessly into the fluid prose. The authors do disappoint a little in finding only weak lessons from this history that might spark a second communitarian upswing today."
39,"Tomorrow, the World: The Birth of U.S. Global Supremacy",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/tomorrow-world-birth-us-global-supremacy,"Tomorrow, the World: The Birth of U.S. Global Supremacy","Wertheim delves into an important bit of history to try to pinpoint exactly when and why the United States embraced the global military supremacy that Americans have taken for granted for decades. The galvanizing event was not the attack on Pearl Harbor but the swift collapse of France in 1940, which made real the likelihood of a Europe wholly dominated by Nazi Germany. At the time, a small foreign policy elite began to debate whether the United States should take a more active part in world affairs after the war and how they might build public support for such an expanded role. True isolationism, Wertheim claims, was something of a boogeyman, used to distract attention from the fact that the country could pursue other, less militarized forms of internationalism. The United Nations, in this telling, was designed as an institution that would provide cover for U.S. hegemony, without interfering with U.S. freedom of military action. Internationalism and military dominance were thereby conflated, and isolationism came to be seen as “the most grievous sin.” In asserting that the choices made were recognized at the time as “tragic,” Wertheim seemingly ignores the enormous threats the United States faced during World War II and the Cold War. He is on firmer ground in arguing that today U.S. global military dominance has outlived its original purpose."
40,Caste: The Origins of Our Discontents,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/caste-origins-our-discontents,Caste: The Origins of Our Discontents,"Caste, as Wilkerson sees it, is the bones beneath the superficial skin we call “race.” It is the obdurate set of assumptions and expectations buried so deeply in human experience that it is all but impossible to excise. Wilkerson identifies the shared features of the caste systems in three countries—Nazi Germany, India, and the United States—exploring their basis in divine will or natural law, the ways in which caste is inherited, the limits on marriage between caste groups, and the rigid occupational boundaries that caste imposes. Nazi Germany is a poor fit for her thesis, but the argument rests solidly on the other two. Admirers of her earlier book, The Warmth of Other Suns, which dealt with the migration of Black Americans to northern cities during the twentieth century, will recognize her passionate prose, laced with gasp-inducing stories. Readers may not ultimately be convinced that caste and racism are different, but they will come away with a new understanding of systemic racism in the United States, a deeper appreciation of the banal but no less painful wounds it inflicts daily, and a grasp of what it will take to loosen its grip on American society."

Hibbing draws on focus groups and extensive surveys to argue that such individuals differ from their counterparts in the 1950s. They are not searching for an all-powerful authority figure; instead, they feel a mission to protect their families and culture from an expansive, shifting group of “outsiders.” In the Trump era, these grew to include religious minorities, immigrants, supposed welfare cheats, athletes who knelt during the national anthem, and, more broadly, non-Americans and nonwhites. Hibbing dubs these avid Trump supporters “securitarian personalities,” who don’t fear external attack so much as this unending flow of domestic threats. They see the world not as “us versus them” but as the even more sweeping “us versus not-us.” The purpose of Hibbing’s inquiry is undeniably important, since Trump’s voter base will long outlast him. But as with so many other efforts to comprehend Trump’s base, Hibbing sheds some light without providing a fully satisfying set of answers."
42,Assassins’ Deeds: A History of Assassination From Ancient Egypt to the Present Day,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/assassins-deeds-history-assassination-ancient-egypt-present-day,Assassins’ Deeds: A History of Assassination From Ancient Egypt to the Present Day,"In this fast-paced survey, Withington catalogs recorded assassinations from ancient times to the present day. He covers all the best-known cases, including the killings of the Roman leader Julius Caesar, the Bohemian duke Wenceslas, the English archbishop Thomas Becket, the French revolutionary Jean-Paul Marat, the Austrian archduke Franz Ferdinand, the American president John F. Kennedy, his brother Robert Kennedy, and the al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden. The early motives behind these murders included dynastic succession and fear of tyranny. Later on, the imperatives of religion, ideology, and rebellion spurred many assassinations. Daggers and poisons have been the favored tools of assassins, and they remain popular despite the greater efficiency of bombs and bullets. Withington meticulously describes the background, motivation, and method of each killing, which keeps the book interesting. He raises provocative questions—without quite answering them—about whether assassinations make much of a political difference and about the morality of eliminating leaders as an alternative to wider, bloodier conflicts."
43,Two Books on Contemporary Conflict,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2020-12-08/two-books-contemporary-conflict,Two Books on Contemporary Conflict,"These two books explore the most striking features of contemporary international conflict. Thanks to Kilcullen’s serious military experience, access to policymakers, thorough research, and eclectic academic interests, this Australian scholar has become one of the sharpest commentators on modern conflicts. He has shown how Western countries have struggled to cope with new, more agile enemies. In his latest book, Kilcullen draws on James Woolsey’s 1993 confirmation hearings to be director of the CIA, in which he divided U.S. opponents into dragons (major powers such as China and Russia) and snakes (terrorists and insurgents). Kilcullen credits the Russians with developing what he calls “liminal warfare,” making use of unconventional aggressive tactics, such as disinformation campaigns and cyberattacks, without triggering a military response. But the most important innovations come from China, including forming new artificial islands in the South China Sea, with its long-term strategy geared to ambitious, revisionist objectives."

The photographer Catherine Leroy produced some of the most searing images of the war (including a famous one of a distraught U.S. marine cradling a dead comrade). The journalist Frances FitzGerald’s determination to understand the Vietnamese perspective led to one of the most perceptive early books on the war (Fire in the Lake), and the war correspondent Kate Webb’s insistence on getting close to the action resulted in her eventual capture by North Vietnamese troops in Cambodia. Becker blends their individual stories with wider history, setting the unfolding tragedy in Vietnam in the background as her protagonists develop doubts about the logic and legitimacy of the war. She provides vivid accounts of their journalistic exploits and tales of how they suffered in their work—their injuries, traumas, excessive drinking, and complicated affairs."
45,The Son King: Reform and Repression in Saudi Arabia,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2020-12-08/son-king-reform-and-repression-saudi-arabia,The Son King: Reform and Repression in Saudi Arabia,"This book heralds the emergence of an organized political opposition in the growing Saudi Arabian diaspora. An anthropologist and activist based in London, al-Rasheed sketches a somewhat diffident revisionist history of the creation of Saudi Arabia—the only country in the world named after its ruling family. She offers a far more astringent appraisal, however, of what she calls “apostles and apologists” in the West, those leaders and public figures who have naively seen the potential for reform with the arrival of each new Saudi king. She saves her bitterest critique for the current Saudi government, calling it “one of the most secretive and treacherous regimes in the Arab world” and accusing the country’s de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, of “relentless repression.” Al-Rasheed’s recounting of the 2018 murder of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi is familiar, but she places it in a novel and intriguing context: his killing by Saudi agents in Istanbul both reflected and further encouraged political activism among new communities of Saudi exiles in the United States, Europe, and the Middle East. It’s not yet clear if this disparate collection of Islamists, feminists, democrats, members of disaffected tribes, and other dissidents will actually find common cause outside the kingdom. But the diaspora’s growth is a story worth following, and al-Rasheed provides a serviceable introduction."

He traces their origins, how they were received, and what they suggest not only about the war but also about the societies that created them. Russia’s many large monuments to the war, for example, reveal much about that country’s insecurities as a declining power. Japan’s Yasukuni Shrine, dedicated to its fallen soldiers, betrays a reluctance to reckon with its crimes during the war. China commemorates the infamous 1937 Japanese massacre in Nanjing with a statue of a mother and a dead child. South Koreans placed opposite Japan’s embassy in Seoul a representation of the so-called comfort women abused by Japanese soldiers during the war. The most moving memorials preserve the physical remains of earlier structures, such as the concentration camp at Auschwitz, the Atomic Bomb Dome in Hiroshima, and the French village of Oradour-sur-Glane, whose inhabitants were slaughtered by the Nazis. Some memorials to the war have risen far from its battlegrounds; Polish Americans in Jersey City remember the Katyn massacre of Polish officers by the Soviets with a striking statue set against the skyline of New York City."
47,Democracy Against Liberalism: Its Rise and Fall,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/democracy-against-liberalism-its-rise-and-fall,Democracy Against Liberalism: Its Rise and Fall,"Amid a flood of books that seek to explain the rise of populist and authoritarian challenges to liberal democracy, Tucker usefully reminds the reader that liberalism and democracy can exist quite independent of each other. Their coupling in the modern era is a bit of a historical quirk. He argues that regime types vary across three binaries: democracy versus authoritarianism, liberalism versus illiberalism, and technocracy versus populism. Revolutionary dictatorships, such as fascist and communist regimes, often start out as populist authoritarian movements that grow technocratic over time. The East Asian tigers, such as South Korea and Taiwan, began as authoritarian liberal technocracies and only later moved toward democracy. Tucker is particularly interested in illiberal democracies, where populist movements rise through elections and harness state power to undermine democratic checks and balances. Tucker finds these tendencies now in Brazil, Hungary, India, and Poland and in the outlook of right-wing parties in Israel, the United States, and western Europe. He argues that a revolt of middle classes against perceived economic and cultural elites lies behind the surge of illiberal democracy. The book offers some good news: illiberal populist regimes tend to be unstable, and when liberal political rule returns, leaders have opportunities to safeguard against future upheaval by redistributing wealth, rebuilding the social safety net, and expanding educational opportunity."
48,"Bland Fanatics: Liberals, Race, and Empire",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/bland-fanatics-liberals-race-and-empire,"Bland Fanatics: Liberals, Race, and Empire","In this collection of essays, Mishra unfurls his signature narrative of the delusions and failings of Western capitalism and liberalism. The overarching storyline is simple. During the long struggle against communism, Anglo-American elites presented Western liberal democracy as the vanguard of human progress. In the post–Cold War decades that followed, the United States picked up where the British left off to build a “universal liberal empire,” premised on unipolar power, military interventionism, and free-market economics. Across this Anglo-American era, Mishra argues, African, Asian, and Latin American voices were shunted aside in favor of the authority of liberal, Western technocrats and intellectuals. Much of the book is devoted to portraits of Western public intellectuals whom Mishra paints as “cheerleaders” for globalization and neoliberalism. For example, Mishra takes aim at the historian Niall Ferguson for whitewashing the oppression and violence of Western racism and imperialism. For Mishra, the crisis of Western liberalism rests on its inflated pretensions as a model for social advancement, claiming too much and delivering too little. But Mishra does not provide an alternative theory of political change that would take the world to a better place. The naive grandiosity and moral smugness that Mishra sees in the Western liberal democratic experience tends to be mirrored in his own sweeping narrative."
49,Two Books on Ethics in International Relations,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2020-12-08/two-books-ethics-international-relations,Two Books on Ethics in International Relations,"One of the oldest divides in the study of foreign policy is between realism (the pursuit of power) and idealism (the pursuit of moral or legal ideals). These thoughtful books by distinguished scholars argue that the two traditions actually have much in common. Lebow makes the case that leaders who tell the truth and root their foreign policies in widely shared conceptions of justice tend to be more successful than those who premise their actions on the cynical calculations of power politics. Surveying 26 military interventions in the decades after World War II, Lebow finds that wars and military actions not authorized by regional or international organizations weakened, rather than advanced, the interests of the aggressor states. By contrast, ethically informed policies—such as the United States’ efforts to rebuild the economies of postwar Europe, Mao Zedong’s policy of settling border disputes with China’s neighbors, and Germany’s postwar actions to transform itself into a peace-oriented great power—achieved better results. The book is intriguing in its unabashedly instrumental view of ethics, arguing simply that an ethical foreign policy will be more restrained and better guarantee the long-term advancement of the national interest through the cultivation of friends and influence."

As a professor at the prestigious school that educates top leaders in the Chinese Communist Party, I knew enough about history to conclude that it was past time for China to open up its political system.

The days of television screens filled with crowds chanting, “The people demand the overthrow of the regime” seem like ancient history.

In January 2009, the unemployment rate in the country was 7.8 percent, and as of this writing, it was expected to be similar in January 2021.

Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, and Twitter, already powerful before the COVID-19 pandemic, have become even more so during it, as so much of everyday life moves online. As convenient as their technology is, the emergence of such dominant corporations should ring alarm bells—not just because they hold so much economic power but also because they wield so much control over political communication.

0,What Now?,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/issue-packages/2017-06-13/what-now,What’s Inside,"The Trump administration doesn’t yet have a foreign policy, but it does have an instinct—that good fences make good neighbors. But why? As Robert Frost’s narrator points out, “Before I built a wall I’d ask to know / What I was walling in or walling out, / And to whom I was like to give offense.” Lots of things, it turns out, don’t love walls—among them the global economy, U.S. alliances, international institutions, and transnational networks of all kinds. So the debate over wall building becomes a proxy for debates about Washington’s proper approach to the world at large. The global populist revival has reminded everyone that opening up one’s country to globalization carries costs as well as benefits and that both are distributed unequally. But closing one’s country off from globalization carries costs, too—and far heavier ones than populists generally appreciate. Globalization involves endless flows of goods, services, money, and people. When bad actors slip through the cracks, the results can be terrible. But terrible results can come from interrupting good flows, as well. For the United States to throw sand in the gears of the global economy and the liberal international order more gen­ erally would be disastrous, and one can only hope that the Trump adminis­ tration manages to control its more parochial instincts. In practice, of course, open and closed are not binary choices but opposite ends of a spectrum, and the interesting policy questions lie some­ where in between. What the United States needs is not some giant honking wall but a strategy for engaging with the world beyond its borders intelli­gently, giving due weight to both its interests and its responsibilities."

2,Dirty Deeds,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/review-essay/2017-06-13/dirty-deeds,Dirty Deeds,"It is hard to overstate the degree to which China has been transformed in recent decades. Between 1959 and 1961, tens of millions of Chinese starved to death in the Great Famine. Today, China boasts the world’s second-largest economy. The country has virtually eliminated severe poverty among its citizens, a burgeoning middle class thrives in ever-expanding cities, and hundreds of Chinese citizens have become billionaires. Human history offers no other socioeconomic shift of equivalent magnitude."
3,History With Chinese Characteristics,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/history-chinese-characteristics,History With Chinese Characteristics,"On November 15, 2012, the day he became general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, Xi Jinping stood onstage at the Great Hall of the People, in Beijing, to reflect back on his country’s 5,000 years of history. After citing China’s “indelible contribution” to world civilization, Xi called for “the great revival of the Chinese nation.” And he acknowledged that others had “failed one time after another” to realize that goal. Implicit in Xi’s remarks was a promise: unlike his predecessors, he would not fall short."
4,Yes He Did,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/review-essay/2017-06-13/yes-he-did,Yes He Did,"""My name is Barack Obama, I’m a black man and I’m president of the United States,” Obama once told his staff, as he pondered a risky domestic policy choice. “Of course I feel lucky.” This was unusual. Obama was not one for melodrama. His presidency was historic—and implausible—because of his ethnicity: his middle name was Hussein, and his last name was easily mistaken for that of Osama bin Laden. He governed through memorable crises, domestic and foreign. There were landmark successes and some notable failures. But all of these happened within the context of regular political order. Obama’s campaign promise of “hope and change” seemed pretty dramatic at the time; the expectations ran as high among liberals as they would later for Donald Trump’s populist radicalism among some conservatives. And yet, Obama was not a radical. He was an adventurous moderate at home and a cautious realist overseas. He was careful, sometimes to a fault, thoughtful, subtle, and restrained at a time when those qualities were not highly valued by the public or the media."
5,The Next Energy Revolution,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/world/2017-06-13/next-energy-revolution,The Next Energy Revolution,"The technology revolution has transformed one industry after another, from retail to manufacturing to transportation. Its most far-reaching effects, however, may be playing out in the unlikeliest of places: the traditional industries of oil, gas, and electricity."
6,Start-Up Palestine,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/israel/start-palestine,Start-Up Palestine,"For decades, Israeli and Palestinian politicians have pursued a political solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict, only to see their hopes dashed again and again. Today, the prospects for a comprehensive peace agreement remain dim. Policymakers must therefore start looking for other ways to improve the situation on the ground and preserve the possibility of a two-state solution."
7,"Keine Atombombe, Bitte",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/germany/keine-atombombe-bitte,"Keine Atombombe, Bitte","The election of U.S. President Donald Trump last November confounded Berlin. What, German politicians, policymakers, and journalists wondered, should they make of Trump’s vague or even hostile stances toward the EU and NATO or his apparent embrace of Russia? Some hoped that Trump meant to push NATO members to spend more on defense but would, in the end, leave the long-standing U.S. guarantee of European security intact. Others, less optimistic, argued that the days when Germany could rely on the United States for its defense were over—and that the country must start looking out for itself."
8,Don't Follow the Money,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2017-06-13/dont-follow-money,Don’t Follow the Money,"In the first days of the “war on terror,” before the United States had launched air strikes against the Taliban or Special Forces raids on Osama bin Laden’s compounds, President George W. Bush signed Executive Order 13224. The presidential decree, which dates from September 23, 2001, targeted al Qaeda’s money by “prohibiting transactions” with suspected terrorists. “Money is the lifeblood of terrorist operations,” Bush said at the time. “We’re asking the world to stop payment.” Five days later, the UN Security Council followed suit, calling on states to “prevent and suppress the financing” of terrorism in its first substantive resolution since the 9/11 attacks."
9,Paris Isn’t Burning,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/world/paris-isnt-burning,Paris Isn’t Burning,"For decades, the world has understood the threat of climate change. But until recently, the economic and political obstacles to tackling the problem stymied global action. Today, that calculus has changed. Technological progress has made clean energy a profitable investment, and growing popular pressure has forced politicians to respond to the threat of ecological disaster. These trends have enabled major diplomatic breakthroughs, most notably the 2015 Paris agreement. In that pact, 195 countries pledged to make significant reductions in their greenhouse gas emissions. “We’ve shown what’s possible when the world stands as one,” proclaimed U.S. President Barack Obama after the talks concluded."
10,Trump and the Environment,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/united-states/trump-and-environment,Trump and the Environment,"When U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping met in April at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort, one topic was not on the agenda: the environment. Perhaps they couldn’t find enough common ground. Xi, a chemical engineer by training, has often spoken publicly about his concerns over the effects of climate change on China, where almost 20 percent of the land is desert, an area expanding at a rate of more than 1,300 square miles per year. Analysts believe Xi is also determined to help China dominate the clean energy industry. In 2015, China installed more than one wind turbine every hour, on average, and enough solar panels to cover over two dozen soccer fields every day, according to Greenpeace. As part of its drive to clean up dangerous air pollution in Chinese cities, Beijing has canceled the construction of more than 100 coal-fired power plants this year alone. Such measures, coupled with Xi’s commitment to the 2015 Paris agreement on climate change, have turned Xi into a global leader on energy and the environment, filling a void created by the man who sat across the table from him at Mar-a-Lago."
11,Course Correction,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/united-states/course-correction,Course Correction,"The South China Sea is fast becoming the world’s most important waterway. As the main corridor between the Indian and Pacific Oceans, the sea carries one-third of global maritime trade, worth over $5 trillion, each year, $1.2 trillion of it going to or from the United States. The sea’s large oil and gas reserves and its vast fishing grounds, which produce 12 percent of the world’s annual catch, provide energy and food for Southeast Asia’s 620 million people."
12,Why Globalization Stalled,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/world/2017-06-13/why-globalization-stalled,Why Globalization Stalled,"For many decades after World War II, a broad range of countries shared a fundamental economic vision. They endorsed an increasingly open system for trade in goods and services, supported by international institutions; allowed capital, corporations, and, to a lesser extent, people to flow freely across borders; and encouraged the rapid spread of data and technology. As trade expanded, global living standards improved dramatically, and hundreds of millions of people escaped from poverty."
13,A New Truman Doctrine,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2017-06-13/new-truman-doctrine,A New Truman Doctrine,Donald Trump’s victory in the 2016 U.S. presidential election has prompted a major reassessment of the United States’ global role—the most fundamental rethinking since the immediate aftermath of World War II.
14,A Tale of Two Tax Plans,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2017-05-24/tale-two-tax-plans,A Tale of Two Tax Plans,"Republicans have long panned the U.S. tax system; now they have a plan to change it. In fact, two plans. The first comes from Congress, the second from the White House. The congressional “Better Way” plan, championed by Paul Ryan, the Speaker of the House, and Kevin Brady, chair of the House Ways and Means Committee, would create a business tax system that has never existed anywhere in the world. The White House plan would enact a massive tax cut, mostly for the wealthy."
15,The Right Way to Reform Health Care,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2017-06-13/right-way-reform-health-care,The Right Way to Reform Health Care,"Perhaps no U.S. law has been more passionately opposed by Republicans than the Affordable Care Act. For the past eight years, they have repeatedly pledged to abolish Obamacare, with the House of Representatives voting more than 50 times to repeal it. U.S. President Donald Trump took office promising to do just that. In May, after months of heated negotiations, including two failures to corral votes within their own party, House Republicans managed—barely—to pass their first real replacement, the American Health Care Act."
16,Trump the Traditionalist,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2017-06-13/trump-traditionalist,Trump the Traditionalist,"Imagine two U.S. foreign policy analysts plucked from their Washington think tanks and marooned on desert islands, one just before Donald Trump announced his presidential candidacy and the other just before the 2016 election itself. After the election, both are told that the Republican candidate won and are asked to predict the new administration’s foreign policy. Whose predictions would have been more accurate?"
17,Where to Go From Here,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2017-06-11/where-go-here,Where to Go From Here,"Every new U.S. administration takes several months to staff itself properly, master new and often unfamiliar responsibilities, and develop a comprehensive strategy for American foreign policy. The Trump administration’s start has been especially rocky. But the administration has already executed a noticeable course shift on foreign policy and international affairs, exchanging some of its early outsider rhetoric and personnel for more conventional choices. If it can continue to elaborate and professionalize its new approach, it could achieve a number of successes. But for that to happen, the administration will have to act with considerably greater discipline and work to frame its policies toward regional and global issues as part of a coherent, strategic approach to international relations that benefits the United States, its allies and partners, and the world at large."

0,The Rise and Decline of the American Century,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2019-02-12/rise-and-decline-american-century,The Rise and Decline of the American Century,"After World War II, the United States set about building a global order. Some historians believe this was an effort to balance against Soviet power. Others view the order as a modern empire, designed to make the world safe for American capitalism. Walker offers a third interpretation: the United States did want to spread its influence and the American way of life, but it did so by weaving other societies into a Pax Americana. This is the vision Walker sees in the Life owner Henry Luce’s famous 1941 call for “an American Century.” Walker provides an impressively detailed account of U.S. foreign policy in the early postwar decades, as the United States, in the words of Secretary of State Dean Acheson, learned how to “run the show.” Walker agrees with the historian Melvyn Leffler that the United States was driven by the need to protect itself against the illiberal and imperial projects that imperiled it. It sought “preponderance,” Walker says, but not “domination.” Walker closes his story with the presidency of Richard Nixon, when Americans feared that their century was already ending and the country was struggling to avoid decline."
1,The New Nationalism,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/issue-packages/2019-02-12/new-nationalism,What’s Inside,"The nation-state is so dominant today that it seems natural. But no political arrangements are natural, and any concept with a hyphen has a fault line running through it by definition. States are sovereign political structures. Nations are unified social groups. What does each owe the other?"
2,Building a Better Nationalism,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/review-essay/2019-02-12/building-better-nationalism,Building a Better Nationalism,"At a rally in Texas last October, U.S. President Donald Trump was delivering his familiar “America first” message, complaining about “corrupt, power-hungry globalists,” when he tried out a new line: “You know, they have a word—it sort of became old-fashioned—it’s called, ‘a nationalist.’ And I say, ‘Really, we’re not supposed to use that word,’” he added, grinning. “You know what I am? I’m a nationalist, OK? I’m a nationalist.” As the crowd cheered, “U.S.A.! U.S.A.!” Trump nodded. “‘Nationalist’: nothing wrong with it. Use that word!”"
3,The Broken Bargain,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/world/2019-02-12/broken-bargain,The Broken Bargain,"Nationalism and nativism are roiling politics on every continent. With the election of President Donald Trump in the United States, the growing power of right-wing populist parties in Europe, and the ascent of strongmen in states such as China, the Philippines, and Turkey, liberals around the world are struggling to respond to populist nationalism. Today’s nationalists decry the “globalist” liberalism of international institutions. They attack liberal elites as sellouts who care more about foreigners than their fellow citizens. And they promise to put national, rather than global, interests first."
4,The Kurdish Awakening,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/turkey/2019-02-12/kurdish-awakening,The Kurdish Awakening,"We’ve been fighting for a long time in Syria,” said U.S. President Donald Trump in the last days of 2018. “Now it’s time for our troops to come back home.” The president’s surprise call for a rapid withdrawal of the nearly 2,000 U.S. troops stationed in Syria drew widespread criticism from members of the U.S. foreign policy establishment. But it came as an even greater shock to the United States’ main partner in the fight against the Islamic State (or ISIS), the Syrian Kurds. For weeks prior to the announcement, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan had been threatening to invade areas of northern Syria controlled by Kurdish militants. The only thing stopping him was the presence of U.S. troops. Removing them would leave the Kurds deeply exposed. “If [the Americans] will leave,” warned one Syrian Kurd, “we will curse them as traitors.”"
5,Why Nationalism Works,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/world/2019-02-12/why-nationalism-works,Why Nationalism Works,"Nationalism has a bad reputation today. It is, in the minds of many educated Westerners, a dangerous ideology. Some acknowledge the virtues of patriotism, understood as the benign affection for one’s homeland; at the same time, they see nationalism as narrow-minded and immoral, promoting blind loyalty to a country over deeper commitments to justice and humanity. In a January 2019 speech to his country’s diplomatic corps, German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier put this view in stark terms: “Nationalism,” he said, “is an ideological poison.”"
6,The Islamic State in Britain: Radicalization and Resilience in an Activist Network,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2019-02-12/islamic-state-britain-radicalization-and-resilience-activist,The Islamic State in Britain: Radicalization and Resilience in an Activist Network,"This book contains an ethnographic study of al Muhajiroun, an outlawed radical jihadist group in London. Kenney seeks to explain how, despite intense police surveillance, the group survived, attracted adherents, and recruited fighters to join the war in Syria until the British government banned it in 2010. Ideological sympathy, ties of friendship, charismatic leaders, and youthful inexperience led people to join the group. Once there, they learned how to be activists by watching more experienced members, often imbibing even more dangerous ideologies along the way. Tight subgroups permitted the movement to deflect government pressure by frequently reconfiguring themselves and fostering ambiguity about their purposes. As they aged, some members left for more normal lives, while others turned to different, often more radical groups. These broad conclusions are hardly new, but some readers may be surprised by Kenney’s argument that such groups can allow young men to let off steam, thus containing, rather than promoting, violence. As the authorities stamp out these organizations, their disgruntled members may pose an even greater danger."
7,The End of the French Intellectual,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2019-02-12/end-french-intellectual,The End of the French Intellectual,"Modern French intellectuals receive tremendous social respect—so much so that they are generally immune from punishment even when they commit common crimes, preach treason or hatred, or speak in riddles. This book argues that in recent decades, although these intellectuals’ social status has remained largely intact, the quality of their thought has ebbed. Sand is hardly the first to say this—and certainly not the most persuasive. He is concerned with only one angle of French intellectual life: the conflict between Jews and Muslims. He argues that a century ago, anti-Semitism led many leading French intellectuals to abandon the army captain Alfred Dreyfus after he was falsely convicted of treason. Under the Nazi occupation, many again failed to defend the Jews. Today, Islamophobia is common. Sand argues that the cartoons that provoked the Charlie Hebdo shooting in 2015 trucked in tasteless ethnic stereotypes that would have been unacceptable if directed at Jews. He has a point, but he is wrong to level the same charge at such leading French thinkers as Alain Finkielkraut, Michel Houellebecq, and Éric Zemmour. These men may be sensationalistic and perhaps even distasteful, but Sand does little to show that they preach systematic ethnic hatred in the manner of their anti-Dreyfusard and pro-fascist predecessors."
8,"A Bite-Sized History of France: Gastronomic Tales of Revolution, War, and Enlightenment",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2019-02-12/bite-sized-history-france-gastronomic-tales-revolution-war-and,"A Bite-Sized History of France: Gastronomic Tales of Revolution, War, and Enlightenment","This engaging book recounts the history of France through its food. For the French, their cuisine is a prime source of national pride, but as Hénaut and Mitchell’s lively vignettes show, few French delicacies are indigenous. The Romans converted uncouth beer-drinking Gauls to wine. The Frank Charlemagne standardized French farms, decreeing that every estate should grow garlic, produce honey, and much else. Returning crusaders brought plums and other exotic fruits. Schismatic popes from Italy established eggplants and Syrah wine. An Italian noblewoman turned French queen, Catherine de Medicis, brought artichokes, spinach, broccoli, sorbet, and the fork. The Turks added coffee; the Austrians the croissant. Brutal slave plantations in imperial domains satisfied sugar cravings. One day, Louis XIV’s troops in Spain substituted olive oil for butter, and—voilà!—mayonnaise was born. In the nineteenth century, farmers had to graft American vines onto French grape plants to save them from disease. Today, couscous and pho are ubiquitous in Paris. Aside from a few cases, such as champagne, which was perfected by Dom Pierre Pérignon, a French Benedictine monk, French cuisine is largely the fruit of globalization and appropriation."
9,English Nationalism: A Short History,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2019-02-12/english-nationalism-short-history,English Nationalism: A Short History,"Does England have a national identity distinct from that of the United Kingdom? Recent political conflict between England and the rest of the union over Brexit, Scottish independence, Irish unity, and other issues has made this a hot-button question. Black argues that English nationalism is genuine: Englishness rests on the shared experiences of Magna Carta, the Reformation, the Thirty Years’ War, the British Empire, and World War II. Yet Black struggles to persuade. Memories of internal and external warfare hundreds of years ago neither distinguish England from the rest of the United Kingdom nor reveal much about how media-savvy politicians, a sensationalistic press, and right-wing skinheads are redefining populist nationalism today—something the author all but admits in the last chapter, “Postscript From a Pub.” In general, current events stymie Black. In considering Brexit, he dismisses (without evidence) any thought that Euroskeptical voters are ignorant or have been manipulated, or that they are indulging in nationalism. Yet he fails to provide a plausible alternative explanation for their behavior."
10,Pandemic 1918: Eyewitness Accounts From the Greatest Medical Holocaust in Modern History,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2019-02-12/pandemic-1918-eyewitness-accounts-greatest-medical-holocaust,Pandemic 1918: Eyewitness Accounts From the Greatest Medical Holocaust in Modern History,"Patients coughed up blood riddled with parasitic bacteria, spraying it across hospital rooms. Dying bodies inflated with the air seeping out of their punctured lungs. Huge numbers of otherwise healthy young people died within hours when their powerful immune systems turned on them. Worldwide, between 50 million and 100 million people perished. Among remote populations that lacked immunity, the mortality rate often exceeded 90 percent. Cities threw the dead in mass graves—unless, as in Philadelphia, too few workers remained to bury them all. Scientists and governments were powerless to stop it. This is no horror-movie vision of Ebola or the Black Death. These are stories from the Spanish flu pandemic a century ago, which claimed five times as many victims as World War I. More scientifically rigorous accounts exist, but Arnold, a popular historian, has assembled the most terrifying eyewitness testimony. The lessons are obvious. A pandemic today might well spread even more quickly and kill even more people. General multipurpose vaccines—even genetically engineered ones—are often power-less to combat diseases that mutate rapidly. Only a permanent global system that can quickly diagnose and treat people could blunt the spread of such a scourge, yet governments still underfund such programs."
11,The Point of It All: A Lifetime of Great Loves and Endeavors,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2019-02-12/point-it-all-lifetime-great-loves-and-endeavors,The Point of It All: A Lifetime of Great Loves and Endeavors,"Last summer, the death of Charles Krauthammer, a longtime columnist for The Washington Post, silenced one of the most influential voices in the world of U.S. foreign policy. After a diving accident left him partially paralyzed in 1972, Krauthammer went to on graduate from Harvard Medical School, practice psychiatry, and then enter politics, working as a speechwriter for Vice President Walter Mondale. After the end of the Cold War, Krauthammer, already known for his hawkish foreign policy views, embraced and helped define the concept of unipolarity—the idea that the competition between the United States and the Soviet Union had been replaced by a “unipolar moment,” in which the United States, for a limited time, had no serious rivals. Krauthammer went on to bitterly criticize what he saw as President Barack Obama’s retreat from U.S. responsibilities and what he deemed the fundamentally irresponsible approach of Obama’s successor, Donald Trump. In this book, Krauthammer’s son, Daniel, himself a writer, assembles some of his father’s most important columns. To read (or reread) them is to be reminded of how central the elder Krauthammer was to 30 years of American foreign policy debate."
12,The Chosen Wars: How Judaism Became an American Religion,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2019-02-12/chosen-wars-how-judaism-became-american-religion,The Chosen Wars: How Judaism Became an American Religion,"Weisman makes a convincing case that the cultural and theological beliefs of the nineteenth-century American Jewish community continue to shape American Jewish life today. American Jews of that era, like many of their neighbors, tended to be anticlerical, suspicious of institutions, and independent-minded with respect to religion. Enthusiastically embracing the rational, liberal theology and biblical criticism then coming out of Germany, they worked to adapt an ancient religion to what they saw as a new era of enlightenment. Change was not always smooth: at the 1883 grad-uation of the first new rabbis from the Hebrew Union College of Cincinnati, guests were horrified when waiters served crab, shrimp, and frogs’ legs. After 1880, the largely German American Jewish community would be overwhelmed by a great wave of Jews from central and eastern Europe. But their ideas about Judaism, including their complicated responses to Zionism, endured."
13,John Marshall: The Man Who Made the Supreme Court,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2019-02-12/john-marshall-man-who-made-supreme-court,John Marshall: The Man Who Made the Supreme Court,"It is thanks to John Marshall’s work as the fourth chief justice of the United States that the constitutional doctrines of the Federalist Party, which espoused strong judicial power and the supremacy of the national government over the states, formed the foundation of the American state. As Brookhiser shows in this brisk biography, Marshall’s success was partly due to the power of his legal reasoning and partly to his brilliant management of the men who served with him on the Supreme Court. Marshall doesn’t offer much grist for a biographer; he led a quietly respectable private life and was as marmoreal in his public persona as George Washington. Few surviving papers reveal much of the inner man. Brookhiser does his best with this unpromising material, but Marshall would doubtless be pleased that it is his ideas that dominate this biography, not his quarrels, debts, ambitions, or amours. The greatest blot on Marshall’s record, as Brookhiser notes, was his failure to confront the horrors of slavery. Washington freed his slaves when he died, in 1799. Marshall, who died in 1835, left his in bondage."
14,The Empty Throne: America’s Abdication of Global Leadership,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2019-02-12/empty-throne-americas-abdication-global-leadership,The Empty Throne: America’s Abdication of Global Leadership,"Few observers of U.S. foreign policy have the skills and experience of Daalder and Lindsay. In their new book, they lucidly, if not very originally, argue that U.S. President Donald Trump’s leadership has weakened the United States’ alliances, undermined the institutions on which much of U.S. security depends, and put American companies and exporters at a disadvantage. On the question of why so many voters rejected the traditional foreign policy approach in 2016, Daalder and Lindsay have less to say. Their book refers to U.S. over-extension in the Clinton and Bush administrations and notes that the Obama-era attempt to offer a more limited form of American leadership proved less satisfying than many hoped, but such concerns occupy a marginal place in the narrative. One hopes their next book will do more. The most urgent task facing students of contemporary U.S. foreign policy is less to deconstruct Trump’s approach than to craft long-term strategies that will be politically sustainable at home and effective abroad."
15,Every Day Is Extra,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2019-02-12/every-day-extra,Every Day Is Extra,"Kerry will likely be remembered as the last U.S. secretary of state whose outlook reflected the assumptions and aspirations of the post Cold War unipolar era in world politics. For Kerry, the job involved serving as a kind of global first responder. Christmas 2013 found him managing a crisis in South Sudan: “I was talking to our embassy in Juba and the White House as we tracked militias and fighters. . . . If they reached Juba, and the fighting devolved into chaos, it would be ‘Katy, bar the door!’” Kerry’s successors are unlikely to follow the news in Juba as closely. In other ways, too, Kerry, a son of the old wasp ascendancy, seems to belong to an America that is rapidly receding in the rearview mirror. Kerry saw U.S. power much as he saw his own privilege: as a call to service. His memoir gives a comprehensive and, in places, moving account of his response to that call. People disagree over the wisdom and effectiveness of U.S. foreign policy in the Kerry years, but there can be no serious dispute about the integrity and patriotism that Kerry brought to the job."
16,"We Want to Negotiate: The Secret World of Kidnapping, Hostages, and Ransom",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2019-02-12/we-want-negotiate-secret-world-kidnapping-hostages-and-ransom,"We Want to Negotiate: The Secret World of Kidnapping, Hostages, and Ransom","This excellent and careful book asks tough questions about whether and how governments should negotiate with kidnappers to get hostages released. Simon, who has worked for two decades at the Committee to Protect Journalists, challenges the view that paying ransoms simply creates incentives for more kidnapping. His detailed history of hostage taking includes case studies demonstrating the different approaches followed by such countries as France and Spain, which are prepared to do whatever it takes to free their citizens, and the United Kingdom and the United States, which generally refuse to negotiate and whose nationals are, therefore, more likely to be killed. Kidnappers’ motives vary: some crave publicity; others just want cash. Simon’s overall approach is pragmatic. In addition to arguing against a blanket refusal to negotiate, he addresses the value of publicity campaigns, the risks involved in rescue missions, the role of insurance companies and private negotiators, and how the ransoms actually get paid."
17,Operation Columba—The Secret Pigeon Service: The Untold Story of World War II Resistance in Europe,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2019-02-12/operation-columba-secret-pigeon-service-untold-story-world-war-ii,Operation Columba—The Secret Pigeon Service: The Untold Story of World War II Resistance in Europe,"During World War II, British intelligence agencies sent operatives into occupied Europe to place some 16,000 homing pigeons carried in special containers. Most of the birds were never seen again, in some cases lost to hawks sent by the Germans to intercept them. But about ten percent returned, enough to make the effort worthwhile. The aim was to persuade any local people who chanced on the birds to write messages, hopefully containing intelligence on German military positions and movements, on tiny pieces of rice paper stuffed into a canister clipped onto each pigeon’s leg. As so often in wartime British intelligence, the project was handled by a collection of “oddballs and professors” and suffered from bureaucratic infighting, but it still made a difference. Corera’s vivid account shows how the pigeons’ messages revealed daily life under the Nazis and valuable intelligence. Some of the most useful information, including details of German positions and an assessment of recent British air raids, came from a Belgian network known as Leopold Vindictive, which was led by Father Joseph Raskin, a priest with intelligence experience from the previous war. In the end, Raskin was betrayed and caught and executed by the Germans."
18,The Girls Next Door: Bringing the Home Front to the Front Lines,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2019-02-12/girls-next-door-bringing-home-front-front-lines,The Girls Next Door: Bringing the Home Front to the Front Lines,"From 1918 until the end of the Vietnam War, every time young American men were sent to fight overseas, they would be joined by small groups of young women who would serve drinks and snacks, put on shows, and offer (platonic) friendship to the soldiers. The women were chosen for their good character and attractive appearance, and their presence was meant to remind the men of the ideal of womanhood for which they were fighting, raise soldiers’ morale by providing them with feminine company, and discourage them from seeking out prostitutes. By the end of the Cold War, the practice had died out, as U.S. forces were made up of volunteers rather than draftees and feminism was on the rise. Women began serving as soldiers rather than entertainers. In this fascinating history, Vuic largely lets the women speak for themselves. They signed up out of a desire for overseas adventure, to support the war effort, and out of sympathy for lonely and fearful young men who missed their families. Vuic explores the sexual politics of frontline forces, as the women tried to find the appropriate codes of dress, dating, and maintaining distance to avoid raising expectations they could not meet. The issues of race and segregation also inevitably loom large in her account."
19,Rampage,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2019-02-12/rampage,Rampage,"Early in 1945, U.S. General Douglas MacArthur, who had fled the Philippines three years earlier, returned to wrest the capital, Manila, from the Japanese—just as he had promised. Facing him were just over a quarter of a million soldiers, led by one of Japan’s top generals, Tomoyuki Yamashita, the conqueror of Singapore. The Japanese were well positioned to thwart the American advance but had little ammunition or food. Manila itself was home to one million civilians, many of them close to starvation, and 10,000 prisoners of war, including many Americans. During the ferocious battle for the city, which raged for 29 days, some 100,000 Filipino civilians died. Some were killed by U.S. artillery, but most were murdered by unhinged Japanese troops who used bayonets and grenades to avenge their imminent defeat. Scott’s masterful reconstruction of the horror of the battle intersperses accounts of massacres with happier moments of liberation."
20,Strategy Strikes Back: How “Star Wars” Explains Modern Military Conflict,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2019-02-12/strategy-strikes-back-how-star-wars-explains-modern-military,Strategy Strikes Back: How “Star Wars” Explains Modern Military Conflict,"Academics have long mined science fiction for insights into leadership, strategy, and conflict. This illuminating, if uneven, collection of essays is united by the idea that the Star Wars movies are particularly valuable in this regard. In part, that is due to the quality of the storytelling. But Star Wars has another virtue: popularity. Students, even those in military academies, often struggle with dry texts on strategy and have gaps in their knowledge of contemporary conflicts, but they know all about the struggles between the Galactic Empire and the Rebel Alliance. As the contributors show, teachers can use examples from the Star Wars movies to demonstrate the importance of paying attention to vulnerable societies (the lack of development on Endor), the limitations of modern military training (Jedi training, which separates soldiers from the people they serve and is far too geared toward individual combat), the dangers of an overreliance on technology (the empire’s dependence on the Death Star), and common errors of grand strategy (Yoda’s overconfidence in the Jedis’ ability to protect the republic). These failings also highlight a key difference between the movies and real-life situations: without them, the plots would have been left with less suspense and fewer thrills."

He summarizes a wealth of scholarly research in this compact volume. Worldwide inequality has fallen over the last 30 years thanks to the rapid economic growth that has slashed poverty in China and India. But inequality has risen within each of the countries Sharma studied and in many others, as well. Globalization has played a role in both trends. Exports have created a lot of low-wage jobs in China and cut prices for Americans, bringing down global inequality (although trade has done less to help the more protectionist India). Meanwhile, the accompanying free flow of capital across borders has made its owners richer, concentrating wealth in the hands of a few. Local politics also shape inequality. In the United States, campaign contributions help determine who gets elected and the policies they enact. Local politics also play a big role in authoritarian China and democratic India, where political connections and outright bribery dictate policy and ensure that the wealthy grow ever wealthier."
22,The Venture Capital State: The Silicon Valley Model in East Asia,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2019-02-12/venture-capital-state-silicon-valley-model-east-asia,The Venture Capital State: The Silicon Valley Model in East Asia,"Silicon Valley has become a model for a cluster of successful business start-ups that later mature into firms and turn huge profits for their original venture capital investors. No surprise, then, that many governments—45 so far—have attempted to replicate it. This informative book examines in detail three such attempts—in Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan—and draws on the experiences of related ventures in several other places, including Israel and Japan. Unsurprisingly, Silicon Valley and its host governments, the California state government and the U.S. federal government, have legal, institutional, and cultural characteristics that other places find hard to replicate. Klingler-Vidra shows how Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan have financed new ventures by giving funds and tax breaks to venture capital firms and start-ups. She says little about the ultimate outcomes, such as the number of successful firms per public dollar spent, but she does show that the venture capitalists supported by governments tend to invest in older, already profitable firms rather than true start-ups."
23,Carbon Capture,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2019-02-12/carbon-capture,Carbon Capture,"If humans are to seriously mitigate climate change, they will have to use a lot less coal, oil, and natural gas—or find ways to capture and store the carbon dioxide that fossil fuels give off when they burn. This useful little book explains in simple terms the various methods of capturing and then storing the carbon dioxide emitted by power plants and factories and how much doing so is likely to cost. Herzog also discusses various possible ways to suck carbon dioxide directly out of the atmosphere, since what’s already up there is the leading cause of global warming. Right now, the main options for capturing and storing carbon dioxide are not cheap, but the price might well prove bearable; capture and storage would raise the cost of producing electricity in a modern coal-fired power plant by 43 percent. (Herzog calculates that that would mean the typical American consumer would pay about 25 percent more to run his or her appliances.) Herzog also describes various programs that already capture and store carbon dioxide and the strengths and deficiencies of their different approaches. Given how much coal, oil, and gas the world uses, it is surprising that countries have not already put more time and money into such technologies."

Under that arrangement, the federal government provided deposit insurance (thereby limiting bank runs), and in exchange, the banks accepted heavy regulation. In romping fashion, Day recounts the troubling story of the last 40 years, during which a combination of new legislation and deregulation broke that bargain. In large part thanks to lobbying and campaign contributions by financial firms, Congress rolled back regulations. Meanwhile, regulators, such as Robert Rubin, U.S. treasury secretary during the Clinton administration, and Alan Greenspan, a longtime chair of the Federal Reserve, embraced a philosophy of deregulation and supported, and even encouraged, the rollbacks. Some regulators, bankers, state government officials, and even legislators did warn of the risks, but those in power did not heed them."
25,The Pan-Industrial Revolution: How New Manufacturing Titans Will Transform the World,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2019-02-12/pan-industrial-revolution-how-new-manufacturing-titans-will,The Pan-Industrial Revolution: How New Manufacturing Titans Will Transform the World,"In the United States and elsewhere, D’Aveni predicts, manufacturing will accelerate over the next decade and come to dominate the economy. His book notes two broad trends behind this takeoff. The first is the increasing substitution of 3-D printing (an example of what is known as “additive manufacturing”) for traditional assembly lines. This technology greatly reduces manufacturers’ economies of scale but makes production faster and allows firms to cater to ever-changing consumer tastes and business requirements. The second trend is the growth of individual manufacturing firms, which he argues will come to span many industrial sectors. In part, that’s also the result of additive manufacturing, which will allow companies to make products physically near their customers while controlling the process from distant headquarters. In most countries, these giant companies will employ fewer people than their predecessors, as machines will replace assembly-line workers. They may create some extra jobs in the United States, but these will require much higher skill levels than does the typical manufacturing job today. The new behemoths will pose serious challenges to competition regulators and consumer watchdogs, which may need to act to block monopolies and protect customers’ privacy."

After all, the Westphalian state system was invented in seventeenth-century Europe, and today’s order has Anglo-American fingerprints all over it. Acharya stresses the agency of non-Western actors and offers an alternative vision of a decentralized global system. He argues that despite their pretensions to universality, the Westphalian system and the liberal world order do not encompass the whole world. International order is contested, and countries on the receiving end of Western power often push back. Regional institutions, in particular, provide “sites for the creation and diffusion” of non-Western ideas. Yet the global pluralism that Acharya describes is closer to the open, multilayered liberal international order than he suggests."
27,The Development Century: A Global History,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2019-02-12/development-century-global-history,The Development Century: A Global History,"During the twentieth century, development emerged as a concept and an organized activity in international society. Every year, governments, international organizations, and private foundations send money and experts abroad to promote economic growth and social development. This collection of essays by a group of prominent historians provides the best portrait yet of the origins and evolution of international development. The rise of Cold War–era modernization theory and the geopolitics of U.S. foreign aid are well-known stories. But these authors show that international development has a much longer history, one that is intertwined with the emergence of the modern global order. In her contribution, Amanda Kay McVety traces the concept to the Enlightenment and the work of early political economists, such as Adam Smith. Others look at how development was entangled with nineteenth-century European empires and twentieth-century struggles over decolonization and nation building. A chapter by Manela charts the history of disease control and the emergence of a global institutional framework for development assistance. Timothy Nunan explores the efforts of European foresters, American nongovernmental organizations, and Soviet engineers to develop Afghanistan in the 1960s and 1970s. Taken together, these and other contributions suggest that international development is best understood not as the diffusion of knowledge from the West to the rest or as a manifestation of the Cold War struggle but instead as a shared language and set of practices that transcend ideological and political divides."

Theorists tend to focus on power and interests, not values. In this ambitious book, Reus-Smit seeks to change that. His first discovery is that scholars acknowledge the role of cultural interactions more than one might think. Samuel Huntington famously depicted a “clash of civilizations,” and realists sometimes make arguments about the effects of nationalism. Liberal and rationalist theories of politics often note how better cultural understanding can make cooperation easier. But Reus-Smit argues that scholars conceive of culture as fixed rather than fluid. He also points out that all the great international orders in history—the Roman Empire, the Qing dynasty, the Ottoman Empire, and early modern Europe—evolved in heterogeneous cultural contexts. Grappling with such diversity, Reus-Smit argues, is one of the great tasks of order building."
29,The Rise and Fall of Peace on Earth,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2019-02-12/rise-and-fall-peace-earth,The Rise and Fall of Peace on Earth,"Mandelbaum argues that the 25 years after the end of the Cold War were uniquely peaceful thanks to three forces: U.S. liberal hegemony, the spread of democracy, and rising economic interdependence. This was not merely a “realist peace,” that is, a momentary pause in geopolitics or a reflection of U.S. unipolarity. Around the world, there were glimmers of a “Kantian peace,” rooted in shared interests and values among liberal democratic states. Why did it unravel? Mandelbaum points the finger at Russia’s aggression in Europe, China’s expansionism in Asia, and Iran’s tendency to sow chaos in the Middle East. Interestingly, Mandelbaum spares the United States most of the blame. He argues that although NATO expansion did, as many suggest, antagonize Russia, today’s great-power revisionism was caused primarily by the spread of democracy. Ironically, he argues, if democracy had not shown such worldwide appeal, illiberal states would have pursued less aggressive policies in response. World peace, it seems, will have to wait until democracy wins a more complete victory."
30,Educate to Liberate,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/united-states/educate-liberate,Educate to Liberate,"A populist wave is sweeping the Western world. In Austria, Hungary, Italy, Poland, and the United States, populist parties and candidates have entered the government. In France, Germany, Greece, the Netherlands, Sweden, and the United Kingdom, they have won record levels of support and reshaped the political landscape. What makes these victories so disturbing is the characteristic that unites all populists: their rejection of liberal values. If the world once seemed to be moving inexorably toward greater political and economic freedom, human dignity, tolerance, equality, nondiscrimination, open markets, and international cooperation, all are now under threat. That is bad enough, but the decline of liberalism will have consequences beyond a few individual countries. Because the countries that uphold the liberal international order, especially the United States, are turning against liberalism, they risk undermining the order they built, ushering in a more antagonistic and dangerous world."

Seventy-five years after the United States helped found it, this global system of alliances, institutions, and norms is under attack like never before. From within, the order is contending with growing populism, nationalism, and authoritarianism. Externally, it faces mounting pressure from a pugnacious Russia and a rising China. At stake is the survival of not just the order itself but also the unprecedented economic prosperity and peace it has nurtured."
32,False Flags,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2019-02-12/false-flags,False Flags,"There appears to be one indisputable global trend today: the rise of nationalism. Self-described nationalists now lead not only the world’s largest autocracies but also some of its most populous democracies, including Brazil, India, and the United States. A deepening fault line seems to divide cosmopolitans and nationalists, advocates of “drawbridge down” and “drawbridge up.” And it seems that more and more people are opting for the latter—for “closed” over “open.”"

But more and more are now seeing it for what it is: a costly, human-made disaster unfolding before their very eyes. A wave of increasingly destructive hurricanes, heat spells, and wildfires has ravaged communities across the United States, and both scientists and citizens are able to connect these extreme events to a warming earth. Seven in ten Americans agree that global warming is happening, according to a 2018 study conducted by the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication. About six in ten think it is mostly caused by human activity and is already changing the weather. Four in ten say they have personally experienced its impact. And seven in ten say the United States should enact measures to cut greenhouse gas emissions, including prices and limits on carbon dioxide pollution, no matter what other countries do."

The world’s strongest powers did not fight one another or even think much about doing so. They did not, on the whole, prepare for war, anticipate war, or conduct negotiations and political maneuvers with the prospect of war looming in the background. As U.S. global military hegemony persisted, the possibility of developed nations fighting one another seemed ever more remote."
35,Blood for Soil,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2019-02-12/blood-soil,Blood for Soil,"Since the French Revolution, nationalism—the idea that state borders should coincide with national communities—has constituted the core source of political legitimacy around the world. As nationalism spread from western Europe in the early nineteenth century, it became increasingly ethnic in nature. In places where the state and the nation did not match up, such as Germany, Italy, and most of eastern Europe, the nation tended to be defined in terms of ethnicity, which led to violent processes of unification or secession. At the beginning of the twentieth century, ethnic nationalism came to disrupt political borders even more, leading to the breakup of multiethnic empires, including the Habsburg, Ottoman, and Russian ones. By changing the size of Europe’s political units, this undermined the balance of power and contributed to two world wars."

Instead, Degler, a gentle and quietly heroic man, accused his colleagues of nothing short of dereliction of duty: appalled by nationalism, they had abandoned the study of the nation."

His first mistake was looking for food alone; perhaps things would have turned out differently if he’d been with someone else. The second, bigger mistake was wandering too far up the valley into a dangerous wooded area. This was where he risked running into the Others, the ones from the ridge above the valley. At first, there were two of them, and he tried to fight, but another four crept up behind him and he was surrounded. They left him there to bleed to death and later returned to mutilate his body. Eventually, nearly 20 such killings took place, until there was no one left, and the Others took over the whole valley."

The most important one, she argues, is how accountable peacemakers are to local people. Unfortunately, she reports, most peace workers answer primarily to the Western headquarters of the international agencies for which they work. Rather than developing strong relationships with locals who can inform them about conditions on the ground and help them get things done, they spend most of their time fulfilling reporting requirements and other bureaucratic tasks to keep their administrators happy. The book is steeped in the language of public administration and organizational theory, and Campbell is cautious in her conclusions, so it is easy to miss how devastating her account really is. She shows that the core organizational logic of peace-building agencies undermines their ability to help the people they are trying to reach."

Africans, he says, are trying to escape their dysfunctional home countries. Conflict, bad governance, and stagnant economies leave many Africans with such dismal prospects that they are willing to attempt the perilous journey. Asserate does not believe that it is possible to stop them—or ethical to try. In his view, the only practical solution is the economic and political development of Africa, to which Europe should now dedicate itself. Since he blames the legacy of European colonialism for much of what ails African countries, he believes the continent has a moral obligation to make a massive effort on behalf of Africans. Even if one does not agree with his normative argument, Asserate is clearly right that in the long run, the only way to moderate illegal migrant flows from Africa is to improve the welfare of Africans at home."

This probing, well-informed account from one of the most astute observers of contemporary Nigeria argues that since democracy was restored in the country, in 1999, the Christian side of Nigerian politics has been marked by the rising power of Pentecostalism, a loose category that encompasses as many as a third of Nigerians and is the country’s fastest-growing religious group. Obadare shows how Pentecostal churches have turned their numerical ascendancy into political influence. Two of Nigeria’s four presidents since 1999, Olusegun Obasanjo and Goodluck Jonathan, were Pentecostals, and although the current president, Muhammadu Buhari, is Muslim, his administration contains several prominent Pentecostals. Obadare sees Pentecostals as a force for stability but not democracy, as pastors typically use their pulpits to legitimate a corrupt and ineffectual elite. One consequence, he worries, has been growing Christian-Muslim polarization, as the Pentecostal churches have proved less accommodating of Muslims than have the establishment Christian churches."
44,Two Books on South Africa,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2019-02-12/two-books-south-africa,Two Books on South Africa,"These two excellent books provide some clues about the prospects for South African democracy. Chipkin and his co-authors analyze the corruption scandals that helped bring down President Jacob Zuma in early 2018. They provide meticulous evidence that Zuma and his associates, most notably the Gupta family and its business empire, captured state institutions for personal gain. The book documents the influence peddling, rent seeking, insider trading, and corruption that helped turn the Guptas’ business into one of South Africa’s largest corporate empires. In the end, the justice system, key elements of the ruling African National Congress, and the press resisted capture and exposed the scandal. The book describes an alarming level of corruption inside the anc and the state bureaucracy, but that such a book could be published at all in South Africa is a cause for optimism."

Intrepid travelers spent years and fortunes learning languages, registering facts, and coming up with generalizations that were as often wrong as right. The travelers’ images of the East, Osterhammel writes in this learned and engrossing account, played “a key rhetorical role in the domestic controversies of the era.” Montesquieu, who never visited Asia, used the idea of Oriental despotism to expose the risks of Bourbon absolutism; his less well-known royalist compatriot Abraham-Hyacinthe Anquetil-Duperron defended the Bourbons by showing that Oriental monarchies ruled through law. Every major philosophical dispute of the age was influenced by the work of scholars of the East, on subjects as diverse as the nature of civilization, the forms of government, the sources of national wealth, the stages of social development, and the role of women. These disputes laid the foundations for much of modern political thought. Over the course of the eighteenth century, Europeans shifted from an open attitude toward Asia to the belief that only European society was rational, dynamic, and just. That attitude then helped justify the colonialism of the following century."

India possesses or is developing ballistic missiles that can reach anywhere in China, shorter-range missiles for potential tactical use against China and Pakistan, missiles with multiple independently targeted warheads, submarine-launched missiles, and missile defenses. Pakistan has developed a variety of nuclear weapons and delivery vehicles intended to deter even nonnuclear Indian attacks. China has merged its conventional and nuclear missile forces under a single command, making it harder for an adversary to know what kind of warhead has been launched. China and India have both adopted more aggressive postures near disputed sections of their shared border. The two countries have announced “no first use” policies but have left them ambiguous; Pakistan has no such policy at all. Concepts such as “minimum deterrence,” “limited deterrence,” “credible deterrence,” and “full-spectrum deterrence” are tossed about with little clarity on what they mean. Add in the near-total lack of dialogue among the three states, and the opportunities for miscommunication and miscalculation proliferate."

A View From Within,"Natalegawa, a former Indonesian foreign minister, is a strong believer in the value of the ten-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations, and its often-derided process of constant meetings and declarations, for dampening conflict and getting the attention of outside powers. He gives blow-by-blow accounts of some of his toughest negotiations within the group. He helped persuade Myanmar to accept international aid after Cyclone Nargis, mediated Cambodian-Thai talks over the contested Preah Vihear Temple, worked to pull ASEAN member states back together after a split over the South China Sea, and pushed the group to adopt a declaration of principles on human rights. Natalegawa’s stories constitute a primer on the dark arts of diplomacy, including the value of ambiguity, the cultivation of personal relationships with fellow leaders, creative word and punctuation choices, the profligate use of the passive voice—and just showing up. As the most populous and most active member of ASEAN, Indonesia has been accused of “overactivism” by other members. Natalegawa is proud to own the label."

But the result was to import the ideological Cold War into POW camps. Anticommunist North Koreans tattooed themselves and wrote petitions in blood demanding to be released to fight against their former comrades. Meanwhile, the majority of North Korean prisoners saw the U.S.-led forces as colonialists and anyone who refused repatriation as a traitor, so they protested the voluntary repatriation policy by demonstrating, singing songs, getting into shouting matches with the guards, going on hunger strikes, and, in one famous incident, kidnapping a U.S. camp commander. American POWs in Chinese and North Korean camps formed groups of self-described “reactionaries,” including one that called itself the Ku Klux Klan, to punish anyone who seemed to accept the communists’ criticisms of the United States. When 21 American POWs decided to go to China instead of returning home, Americans panicked over “brainwashing.” Partly as a result of the panic, even American POWs who came home were suspected of communist contamination."

As Pollack reveals, they are linked as much to Berlin, Miami, and New York as to Beijing and Shanghai, and as much to the Internet, animation, and performance as to paint and wood. They make fresh use of images and techniques from all over the world and from many different historical periods. They do not feel compelled to focus on the totalitarian past or the enduring puzzle of what it means to be Chinese, as the first post-Mao generation of modern Chinese artists did. But China and its problems keep tugging at them. To avoid politics is to be political; to produce unique work is to join a trend; to call oneself “an artist from China” (as this younger generation prefers to do) instead of “a Chinese artist” is to comment on being Chinese today. Along with this analysis, Pollack offers plenty of sharp biographical and aesthetic insights. The book’s illustrations leave the reader eager for more contemporary Chinese art."

The country faces intractable problems: a falling population, excessive government debt, the decline of its most important ally (the United States), and the rise of its main rival (China). But weak leadership and political gridlock have made Japan’s situation worse. Glosserman puts the ultimate blame on Japan’s culture of collectivism, harmony, and fatalism. The Japanese are too comfortable to strike out on a new path, he says. Although Prime Minister Shinzo Abe aims to revitalize his country, Glosserman regretfully concludes that Japan “can no longer harbor grand ambitions.”"

The two organizations coordinate policy, but neither calls the shots for the other. Andersen and Damle take an exceptionally well-informed look at the RSS, including its relations with affiliate organizations, such as India’s largest trade union and student association, and its policies on the slaughter of cows, foreign direct investment, relations with China, and other issues. As the RSS has grown, its leadership has moderated the group’s fundamentalist ideology, denounced caste discrimination, and tried, without much success, to bring women and non-Hindus into the ranks. The group’s core concept of Hindutva, or “Hinduness,” is now glossed as loyalty to a vaguely defined Indian civilization rather than adherence to specific religious practices, a revision made easier by the unsystematic character of Hindu beliefs. But religious nationalism remains the RSS’ chief mobilizing tool, and many of the organization’s local branches and affiliates still espouse aggressive anti-Muslim and socially conservative positions."

They held him prisoner until June 1985, when he died of torture and neglect. Buckley, who had served in the Korean War before embarking on a long and distinguished career with the CIA, rose to the position of Beirut station chief after the bombings of the U.S. embassy and the Marine barracks there. His nemesis was Imad Mughniyeh, Hezbollah’s master hit man, who was himself blown up by a car bomb in Damascus in 2008. The authors of this account of Buckley’s murder seek to honor his memory and openly thirst to avenge his death. They clearly intend the story to grip the reader, but too often they fall into annoying invocations of supposed local color. They also lament the “castration” of the CIA by the 1975 Church Committee investigation into the intelligence community, and they rejoice that the 9/11 attacks prompted the rebirth of the agency as a paramilitary force tasked with hunting the United States’ enemies."

The book provides extraordinary depth and detail, yet Giustozzi still manages to show the forest along with the trees. As its home base in Iraq and Syria collapses, the Islamic State (or ISIS) is looking for a new home. Khorasan offers big advantages over Libya, Yemen, or the Sahel: it is close to China, Iran, and Russia, and to U.S. forces based in Afghanistan. The ISIS affiliate known as the Islamic State in Khorasan receives around $300 million each year from outside donors, mostly individuals from Kuwait, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia, but the governments of those countries contribute, too. The ISK wants to absorb the Taliban and then take the fight to its external enemies, above all Iran. The ISK's greatest hope is Iran’s fear: that the Taliban will cut a deal with the Afghan government that will discredit the group among true believers, sending recruits to the ISK."

The organizers interviewed 1,000 people in each place. The survey leaves out some important countries, but its results offer cause for hope. Although most of the respondents had negative views of the 2011 uprisings that formed the Arab Spring, two-thirds of them expressed optimism about the future. The vast majority wanted to help the less privileged. They respected their families more than any other institution. (Their countries’ respective militaries came second.) And although they reported having little respect for political parties or parliaments, they still wanted to participate in civic life. Two-thirds professed strong religious faith, but most of them regarded religion as a personal matter. In the final chapter, Mathias Albert and Gertel compare those surveyed with their German counterparts. The two groups have similar levels of optimism, they find, but German youth are much more interested in formal politics than are young Arabs."

So the United States needs to understand why it failed to build nations in Afghanistan and Iraq and how it might do better elsewhere. It must focus on creating a shared sense of national destiny, Gregg says, which will require devolving reform to the local level so that the people own the process. Gregg sees the U.S. military as the right agent to achieve this. The military can even make Afghan peasants better farmers, she says. Nearly every part of Gregg’s analysis contains problems. She largely ignores the literature on democratic transitions and counterinsurgency and barely mentions the role of external actors, such as Pakistan’s intelligence services, in supporting the Taliban in Afghanistan. Worst of all, she offers no examples of successful nation building by an occupying power. In the success stories Gregg does tell, such as Rwanda, reform came from the inside."

In quick strokes, he paints Russia’s history in the Middle East and President Vladimir Putin’s objectives over the last two decades. Putin has chosen the region as the theater to reassert Russia’s global role after its 25-year absence. Russia has no grand strategy for the Middle East, but it has managed overlapping and often antagonistic coalitions with great skill. As Trenin reminds readers, Russia unreservedly supported the United States in the wake of the 9/11 attacks, and in 2011, Putin tasked Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev with crafting a grand bargain with U.S. President Barack Obama. The effort failed, and after the Obama administration’s disastrous intervention in Libya later that year, which Russia had initially endorsed, Putin challenged the United States in the Middle East for the first time. Moscow still wants to strike deals with Washington on several specific issues: post-civil-war Syria, Iran’s nuclear program, the future of Afghanistan, and the Arab-Israeli conflict. On the last, Trenin shows that Putin has positioned himself to serve as a far more honest broker between the Israelis and the Palestinians than has the Trump team."

Nisley, a former volunteer in the Dominican Republic, argues that the Peace Corps, which costs roughly $50,000 per volunteer per year, has provided a cost-effective way to advance U.S. foreign policy. Small project by small project, the volunteers promote development in poor countries. Statistical evidence suggests that their sustained interactions with local citizens improve perceptions of the United States. In perhaps its most important role, the Peace Corps serves as a graduate school in foreign policy, preparing volunteers for careers in diplomacy and international development. The White House’s enthusiasm for the Peace Corps has waxed and waned, Nisley finds, depending on presidential preferences and perceived security threats. For John F. Kennedy, the Peace Corps aligned well with his Alliance for Progress initiative, which aimed to promote democracy and economic growth in Latin America. Richard Nixon saw the Peace Corps as a haven for those opposed to the Vietnam War and reduced the number of volunteers. Later, Ronald Reagan expanded the agency’s presence in Central America to counter leftist insurgencies."

The region has enjoyed economic stability and has made significant strides toward integrating commerce, installing modern telecommunications networks, adopting renewable energy, and improving its residents’ quality of life. Local firms now stretch across the region, and foreign direct investment has accelerated. But a demographic explosion has eroded these gains. Central America’s population skyrocketed from 13 million in 1960 to nearly 50 million today. Rural poverty remains shockingly high, especially in Guatemala and Honduras. As a result, much of the region’s foreign currency comes from emigrant workers; remittances totaled $84 billion from 2013 to 2017. The report emphasizes the need for investment in public education, rural irrigation, and basic infrastructure, since lasting increases in real wages will require strong growth in labor productivity. It also warns the United States against deporting millions of immigrants, as sending so many people back would inflame social tensions in their home countries."

As a result of the continuing shortfall, over the next decade, the national debt—the total amount owed by the U.S. government—is projected to balloon from its current level of 78 percent of GDP to 105 percent of GDP. Such huge amounts of debt are unprecedented for the United States during a time of economic prosperity."

By 2050, if current economic trends persist, China may use its growing economic power and technological sophistication to co-opt Latin American business and political elites and give Chinese firms a competitive advantage. The Chinese military presence in Latin America is also likely to expand, especially if China wins a military confrontation with the United States (over Taiwan, for example). Latin America is unlikely to produce a coherent strategy to counter China’s encroachments, Ellis judges, although he recommends that the United States help strengthen the region’s regulatory and political institutions so they can better protect against predatory Chinese practices. Ellis’ description of the asymmetric relations between a dominant China and a subservient Latin America recalls Marxist-leaning theorists’ critiques of U.S.–Latin American relations in the 1960s and 1970s. Ellis, however, does acknowledge that Chinese influence may have some upsides. Chinese surveillance technology could enable Latin America to overcome two of its biggest scourges: official corruption and crime syndicates. From the perspective of some Latin Americans, these gains may warrant a grudging acquiescence to Chinese power."
62,The Importance of Elsewhere,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/world/importance-elsewhere,The Importance of Elsewhere,"In October 2016, British Prime Minister Theresa May made her first speech to a Conservative conference as party leader. Evidently seeking to capture the populist spirit of the Brexit vote that brought down her predecessor, she spoke of “a sense—deep, profound, and, let’s face it, often justified—that many people have today that the world works well for a privileged few, but not for them.” What was needed to challenge this, May argued, was a “spirit of citizenship” lacking among the business elites that made up one strand of her party’s base. Citizenship, she said, “means a commitment to the men and women who live around you, who work for you, who buy the goods and services you sell.” She continued:"

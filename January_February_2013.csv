During the Civil War, he emerged as a deft diplomat and sought to coordinate his military and political policies at home with the needs of U.S. diplomacy. Peraino begins with Lincoln’s opposition to the Mexican-American War and chronicles his later management, as president, of relations with France and the United Kingdom during the Civil War. A form of intellectual isolationism frequently mars the work of American historians, who often study U.S. politicians without appreciating how those figures’ perceptions of events overseas influenced their ideas about their country’s role in global affairs. Lincoln in the World avoids this pitfall, and although it is not the final word on some of the subjects it treats, it is an important step toward a richer and more useful understanding of the American past.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

Skeptics demur, however, arguing either that this ""pivot"" -- or ""rebalancing,"" as administration officials now call it -- is toothless rhetoric or that it is a heavy-handed policy that has unnecessarily antagonized China."

Collins describes the institution of songbun, under which each North Korean citizen is assigned “a heredity-based class and socio-political rank over which the individual exercises no control but which determines all aspects of his or her life.” Fifty-one subcategories are clustered into three classes, defined by their level of commitment to the regime: core, wavering, and hostile. Access to jobs, housing, medical care, and even marriage depends on one’s class status. Members of the lower classes are not allowed to live in relatively prosperous cities, such as Pyongyang. The regime directs foreign aid to the “core” group, while the lower groups—perhaps up to 80 percent of the population—suffer from famine and a high risk of political imprisonment."
3,Democratization in Africa; Governing Africa’s Changing Societies,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2012-12-27/democratization-africa-governing-africas-changing-societies,Democratization in Africa; Governing Africa’s Changing Societies,"These two collections assess the prospects for positive change in sub-Saharan Africa. Crawford and Lynch survey the region’s political progress and generally find it wanting. Although they concede that two decades of democratization have resulted in some improvement in political and civil rights, they argue that only a few countries in the region can really be considered fully democratic; most are little more than authoritarian regimes that occasionally hold rigged elections. The region has enjoyed strong economic growth in recent years, but the growth remains uneven and fragile and has resulted in increasing inequality and more polarized politics. The book also details the endemic state corruption, feckless political parties, growing ethnic conflict, and lack of basic security that hamstring sub-Saharan Africa, concluding that the region needs much more political reform. They criticize Western donors as mostly uninterested in deepening democracy and African elites as content with the status quo and therefore suggest that positive change is unlikely."
4,After Mandela: The Struggle for Freedom in Post-apartheid South Africa,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2012-12-27/after-mandela-struggle-freedom-post-apartheid-south-africa,After Mandela: The Struggle for Freedom in Post-apartheid South Africa,"Foster spent the last few years interviewing South African political elites and their relatives, civil-society activists, and a handful of “street kids” in South Africa’s burgeoning cities. He explores the contradiction at the core of postapartheid South Africa: the massive gap between the ideals of pluralist democracy articulated by the country’s exemplary constitution and the violence, corruption, and inequality that shape everyday society and politics. This analysis is not particularly original, but the book is salvaged by Foster’s ability to get his subjects to reveal themselves and shed light on their milieu and by his sharply drawn portraits of President Jacob Zuma and former President Nelson Mandela and his family. Foster emphasizes the differences between an older generation of black elites steeped in the discipline of the struggle against apartheid and a younger generation that views South Africa in more cosmopolitan terms and is less interested in politics than in pop music and designer clothes.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

In this book, he tackles the HIV/AIDS crisis in Africa. Chapters by top experts present state-of-the-art research on prevention and treatment, public health systems, and vaccines. These thorough analyses will be of interest to anyone who cares about the state of the pandemic, but they are almost completely silent on the political and social dimensions of the crisis. Moreover, most of the contributors concede that a lack of quality data precludes the kind of cost-benefit analysis that Lomborg promotes, and they put forward few strong policy recommendations other than to call for more research. The book concludes with a brief and disappointing reaction to the preceding chapters by a group of contributors Lomborg describes as “African civil society leaders,” which serves mostly to remind the reader of the unfortunate degree to which the fight against aids in Africa is conceived, funded, and directed from outside the continent.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."
6,Reforming the Unreformable: Lessons From Nigeria,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2012-12-27/reforming-unreformable-lessons-nigeria,Reforming the Unreformable: Lessons From Nigeria,"Okonjo-Iweala is a veteran senior official at the World Bank, and she is often mentioned as a likely choice to become the bank’s president if and when Western powers stop insisting that an American lead the organization. In 2003, Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo asked Okonjo-Iweala to return to her native Nigeria to help the country deal with its massive foreign debt. Over the next few years, she helped persuade the country’s creditors to cancel 60 percent of the debt, making good use of her personal connections within the international financial community. But her attempts to enact economic reforms were less successful, at least in part because of the ambivalence of much of the Nigerian government. Fiscal and monetary reforms have played only a supporting role in helping Nigeria and other African countries achieve a level of economic stability in recent years: rising commodity prices, growing remittances from an increasingly wealthy diaspora, and the emergence of new investors, notably from China and India, have been at least as important. Meanwhile, Nigeria has made very little progress on other pressing problems, from its woeful infrastructure, to its dysfunctional agricultural sector, to its growing social inequality and persistent poverty. Those issues receive only passing references in Okonjo-Iweala’s upbeat account.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

That said, it will certainly discourage readers who believe that the time has come for the Chinese Communist Party to establish genuine democratic political and legal institutions. Indeed, the expert analyses presented here can lead to only one conclusion: the party will continue to rely on increasingly harsh repression to cope with the burgeoning social problems stemming from China’s prodigious economic development. That is likely to keep the lid on the boiling cauldron for the next five or ten years, but it is not a reliable path to the “harmony” and “stability maintenance” incessantly preached by party propagandists. Probing the texture and complexities of Chinese life, each of these essays helps readers understand why Chinese society has become so contentious. In their contributions, Béja, Joshua Rosenzweig, Willy Wo-Lap Lam, and a group of Chinese lawyers (led by the noted defense attorney Mo Shaoping) analyze the unjust, politicized prosecutions of the Nobel Peace Prize winner Liu Xiaobo and other valiant human rights advocates. Michaela Kotyzova explains why, despite the kinship between Liu’s Charter 08 and Charter 77, the manifesto written by Václav Havel when he was a young Czech dissident, one cannot expect China to follow the Czech path to freedom. And Fu, Pils, and Teng Biao relate the experiences and views of attorneys who have bravely taken on the authorities in China, a state in which, as Fu notes, “Lawyers cannot be the representatives of the people’s interests; only the Party can.”Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

The resistance is motivated partly by the environmental and social effects of the presence of U.S. military facilities and also by public anger over crimes committed against Japanese citizens by U.S. servicemen. But McCormack and Norimatsu lay bare the resentment’s deeper historical roots. Okinawans see themselves as an ethnic minority, historically separate and geographically distant from the Japanese. Japan took possession of the Okinawan island chain in the late nineteenth century and later forced its inhabitants to bear terrible burdens during World War II. From 1945 to 1972, the territory was a U.S. military colony without any form of self-rule, and many Okinawans believe that even after the islands’ reversion to Japanese control, their interests have continued to be sacrificed on behalf of Tokyo’s relationship with Washington. The larger frame for McCormack and Norimatsu’s analysis is their sharply worded indictment of the U.S.-Japanese relationship, which they believe is constructed not so much to defend Japan as to serve a U.S. forward deployment strategy aimed at Southeast Asia and China.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."
9,The China Choice: Why America Should Share Power,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2012-12-27/china-choice-why-america-should-share-power,The China Choice: Why America Should Share Power,"Here is a radical idea from Down Under: the United States should share power on an equal basis with China as part of a “Concert of Asia,” which would also include India and Japan. White, a former Australian defense official, sees an era of “sea-denial” coming, when the technology for striking major warships will be so far ahead of their defensive capabilities that even small powers will be able to prevent the largest navies from projecting power at low risk. Along with other factors, this will make it impossible for the United States to dominate the region as it once did and for China to dominate it as some believe it intends to do. White fears that the current U.S. posture of pushing back against Chinese assertiveness will lead to escalation. His arguments have been controversial in Australia, where some have interpreted them as counseling that Australia tilt preemptively toward China. Even if his proposed solution to the problem of how to create a stable balance of power in Asia is a bit too neat, the book is worth reading for its plainspoken analysis of how China’s rise is undermining the confidence of U.S. allies in the region. As China grows, White argues, no one can be sure that the Chinese “will settle for as little as an equal share in the leadership of Asia.”Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

The system’s overlapping, competing, and evolving bureaucracies collect intelligence throughout society, use force to control errant citizens and officials, ferret out spies and dissidents, guard (and surveil) members of the central leadership, and spy on one another. Throughout the party’s history, control over these agencies has been a sought-after prize during high-level power struggles. Because the system comprises a mix of party, state, and military organs with complex vertical and horizontal lines of command, it has never been able to pull together to attempt a coup against the civilian leadership. But functioning without oversight from courts, legislatures, or media, the entrenched security system has managed to maintain control over a turbulent and changing society, blocking the transition to the rule of law, which more and more Chinese regard as necessary.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

Taken together, these four books do not allow readers a full view of the Syrian elephant, but they come close. Starr, a journalist who lived in Damascus for five years, records his encounters with ordinary Syrians and with the state’s intelligence apparatus in an unadorned narrative of the Syrian street. Lesch, an American historian, enjoyed unusual access to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and other regime stalwarts. But that access does not yield any dazzling insights, instead serving only to highlight just how thoroughly Lesch’s high hopes for Assad have been dashed. Haddad, a Syrian academic, analyzes the business allies of Syria’s Baathist regime, a presumed core of support for Assad’s authoritarian rule. Ajami is a more distant observer than the others, but his stage setting and political sketches are superb: after years of judgmental aloofness toward the Arab world, he has finally managed to get into, rather than under, the skin of his protagonists."
12,Muslim Nationalism and the New Turks,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2012-12-27/muslim-nationalism-and-new-turks,Muslim Nationalism and the New Turks,"Even for those already familiar with contemporary Turkey, this sometimes disturbing book will be an eye opener. Drawing on four decades of direct observation of Turkish society, White explores the complexities of evolving notions of Turkish identity. She focuses mainly on the Muslim nationalists who have emerged since 1980. They are a rambunctious lot, full of seeming contradictions: for example, according to a 2009 study that White cites, 38 percent of young people who support the ruling Islamist Justice and Development Party nevertheless describe themselves as “Kemalists”—that is, admirers of Kemal Atatürk, the stringently secularistic founder of the Turkish republic. White also explores the foibles of contemporary Turkish secularists: their obsession with racial purity, their fear of debasement through interaction with outsiders, and their sacralization of the republic’s borders. The new Muslim nationalists, in contrast, are more open to diversity, support Turkey’s association with the eu, and seek ways to include ethnic Kurds and minority sects in the body politic. They have also embraced neoliberal economic thought to a surprising degree. Alas, all these competing visions of modern Turkey relegate women to a subordinate status.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."
13,Capitalist Diversity on Europe's Periphery,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2012-12-27/capitalist-diversity-europes-periphery,Capitalist Diversity on Europe’s Periphery,"Scholars no longer see eastern European states as traversing a path from state socialism to liberal capitalism. They now categorize these states as capitalist, although it is still unclear what kind of capitalism they practice. Bohle and Greskovits contend that the capitalism of eastern European states differs from the West’s mature form, although not quite as starkly as the authoritarian capitalism some associate with post-Soviet states. The differences stem from how eastern European states deal with the tensions among market efficiency, social cohesion, and political legitimacy. Bohle and Greskovits see three distinct approaches: the “neoliberalism” that characterizes the Baltic states and favors market efficiency over the other two concerns; the “embedded liberalism” of the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, and Slovakia, which softens the pursuit of market efficiency and pays greater attention to welfare policies; and Slovenia’s “neocorporatist” approach, which seeks to cushion the effects of marketization on particular segments of society. In this tightly argued comparative study, the authors also explore how these three clusters of countries have dealt with their socialist legacies and with the imperatives imposed by a liberal global economy and the financial and economic crisis that it has lately generated.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

It is a place where people live and die, only more so.” That sense of pathos shapes her highly intimate reflections on communism’s bitter residue for Poles, Czechs, and Slovaks. That residue has much to do with the lingering burden of choices made during the era of communist rule—hard choices that harmed others, for, as the Czech dissident Václav Havel wrote, “Everyone in his or her own way [was] both a victim and a supporter of the system.” By sharing the emotional fervor of her many, often deep personal relationships with eastern Europeans, formed during ten years of travel and research in the region, Shore gets at the agony and guilt felt by some and the sublimation resorted to by others. During her visits, she also managed on more than one occasion to meet and ruffle the feathers of those who had served the system loyally and without regrets. Shore, now on Yale’s history faculty, gives depth to this searching, personalized account by weaving into her story brief but deft and unobtrusive elements of historical context.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

Much recent attention has concentrated on how the Soviet system came apart in the late 1980s. Applebaum brings an impassioned, critical eye to its creation and maintenance: the methodical, carefully staged infiltration of key institutions, the often violent elimination of competing voices, and the slow subversion of public and private institutions. The stages by which Joseph Stalin’s Soviet Union established its sway over postwar Eastern Europe have been well studied, but never with this much texture or human testimonial. Applebaum pays relatively little attention to the factors explaining why this all happened, instead focusing on what happened—to millions of displaced people, to the ablest and most courageous members of these societies, to poets and civic activists, and to economies, politics, and the communist lords themselves.

16,Mapping Europe’s Borderlands: Russian Cartography in the Age of Empire,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2012-12-27/mapping-europes-borderlands-russian-cartography-age-empire,Mapping Europe’s Borderlands: Russian Cartography in the Age of Empire,"Maps are not merely distilled representations of geographic realities. Over time, they come to represent an organic bundling of history: reconstructed, imagined, and manipulated. Historically, they have been the tools with which expanding empires have legitimized their conquests, imposed identities, and created administrative order, and with which victims have constructed alternative narratives and salvaged their own national memories. Never was this truer than in the period in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries when a burgeoning Romanov empire joined Austria and Prussia in wiping Poland-Lithuania from the map and absorbing it into their swelling realms. Seegel intricately analyzes the cartography of imperial Russia and Poland-Lithuania as the science evolved and historical demands were placed on it. This is a rich and fascinating angle on history enhanced by a bounty of beautiful reproductions. Rare is a book this aesthetically pleasing and intellectually original. Seegel should be congratulated for creating it, and the University of Chicago Press, for producing it.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."
17,The Color Revolutions,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2012-12-27/color-revolutions,The Color Revolutions,"The three so-called color revolutions were doubly misnamed. First, flowers, not colors, were the symbols for two of the three: the 2003 Rose Revolution in Georgia and the 2005 Tulip Revolution in Kyrgyzstan. And if, at a minimum, “revolution” stands for discontinuity, neither those two dramas nor the 2004 Orange Revolution in Ukraine measured up. Rather than the major course corrections that many in the West hoped for, they were minor interruptions in the steady evolution away from democracy and toward deeper corruption in all three countries. Mitchell has crafted a lucid—albeit minimalist—tour d’horizon of the events themselves and of all three countries’ subsequent backsliding into the illiberal patterns of the past. He also situates the three “revolutions” in a brief but useful reflection on the background factors that shaped the outcome in each case. In particular, he carefully assesses how these interludes figured in U.S.-Russian relations and how U.S. and Russian policies figured in them. For those who want a clear-eyed, dispassionate analysis of cases that too often lack both, this is a good source."

The result is this superb book, which is not merely a fascinating, subtle history of the industry since the Soviet Union’s collapse but also the single most revealing work on Russian politics and economics published in the last several years. Gustafson argues that beginning around 2002, as the Russian state recovered its footing and the golden goose of oil grew fat on explosive price increases, a political face-off between the oil moguls and the power elite surrounding President Vladimir Putin became more or less inevitable—as did its out-come in favor of the latter. However, he writes, oil rents are destined to shrink, and because they are the Russian system’s lifeblood, the system cannot be maintained. Gustafson concludes by describing three potential responses to the perils of Russia’s oil addiction: “high tech modernization,” a “return to market reform,” and “stay the course.” Russia, he warns, can avert a grim future only if it combines elements of all three.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

To answer this question, the authors of this readable and insightful book move beyond simplistic pessimism about generous social welfare policies. Summarizing widely accepted scholarship, they show that considerable room remains for countries to pursue idiosyncratic policies, despite a common need for some austerity measures imposed by the increasing pace of economic and demographic change. Well-designed welfare systems can coexist with and even strengthen economic competitiveness, as demonstrated by the Nordic countries. Where Hay and Wincott advance their own views, however, the results are uneven. They argue unconvincingly that the European Court of Justice imposed more neoliberal policies on the European Union than governments wanted. But they present a compelling empirical analysis showing that the current economic crisis in Europe has been exacerbated by a decline in trade, which has disproportionately hurt competitive export economies with developed social welfare systems, such as Denmark and Sweden.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

He served as the British ambassador to the union and as a private secretary or adviser to five British foreign secretaries and two prime ministers. As a historian, however, Wall has big shoes to fill: the author of the previous volume in this series was the late Alan Milward, the greatest academic historian of European integration, who sharply rejected conventional and official explanations of the eu’s origins. What Wall presents, by contrast, is very much the view from Whitehall and No. 10 Downing Street. When it comes to explaining how British decisions were made, his account is balanced and copiously documented. Yet when he turns to the issue of why decisions were made, the story becomes murkier. British politicians seem to have thought the United Kingdom’s membership was inevitable. But what role did economic, geopolitical, ideological, and more narrowly partisan considerations play in persuading them? Which justifications were fundamental, and which were just window-dressing?

This raises a vital historical question: Why did the European leaders who designed the European Central Bank and the other eurozone institutions leave out so many crucial elements? To answer this question, Mourlon-Druol considers the 1979 creation of the European Monetary System, the predecessor of the eurozone. He argues that the earlier system was weaker than it seemed, because participating governments disagreed about economic priorities -- just as they do now. Germany prioritized the maintenance of anti-inflationary stability through austerity, whereas other countries sought more permissive policies. Just as today, the countries hoped to solve these conflicts by agreeing to modest monetary steps and hoping that, in the long term, their economic preferences would converge. Looking back, that was wishful thinking."

And what would motivate half a million British citizens to vote for extreme right-wing parties whose rhetoric fuels such behavior? Trilling traces the rise of the radical right in the United Kingdom and condemns establishment figures for not taking it more seriously. Journalists, he argues, should not stoke prejudice against asylum seekers and multicultural policies. Politicians should not denigrate immigrants, tighten borders, or curtail government spending on housing and welfare. He believes that it is the retreat of government, not its failure, that creates an opening for radicals."

Washington and Napoleon borrows the method of comparative biography used by Plutarch in his paired biographies of Greek and Roman historical figures. George Washington and Napoleon Bonaparte are well suited to this approach. Both men were marginal figures who sought military glory as a means of social and political advancement, took power as politics were being reshaped by the Enlightenment, and sought to guide revolutionary upheavals along the path to stable systems. The contrasts are also interesting: Washington was a worse general but a more successful commander than Napoleon, who is remembered as a warrior but whose most enduring accomplishments were in civilian law and administration. Some of Flynn and Griffin’s judgments seem forced, but their central contention is certainly sound: Washington’s embrace of constitutionalism and Napoleon’s turn to military despotism sprang not from any deep difference in their characters but from the political cultures that surrounded them and the differing sets of circumstances they faced.

He believes that regulatory capture -- when business interests and lobbyists exercise undue influence over the bureaucracies and legal structures meant to oversee them -- is creating exactly the kind of crony capitalism that sparked major populist surges in earlier eras of U.S. history. With a worried glance at Latin America, where antimarket populist leaders have led a number of countries into deep trouble, Zingales argues that pro-market populism can help fuel economic recovery in the United States and calls for policies that would foster a sense of fairness and bolster public support for capitalism and free markets. At times, the policy discussion seems a bit disjointed, and the enthusiasm Zingales has for economic theory sometimes leads him into digressions.

Rising tuitions, cuts in state funding for public universities, and the growth of outsourcing and automation in white-collar professions are driving significant changes in higher education. Law schools are on the frontlines: as traditional legal work is increasingly outsourced or performed by computers, demand for lawyers is falling, and many lower-tier law schools face declining or even collapsing enrollments. It is difficult to make generalizations about U.S. higher education, a complex social institution that includes everything from world-famous, deep-pocketed research universities to small vocational institutes and community colleges. Nevertheless, Reynolds’ core argument seems correct: social and technological changes are pushing higher education toward dramatic changes, including universities -- and individual professors -- offering classes over the Internet.

The party’s legal minds argued that although slavery was a state institution, and therefore the federal government could not interfere with its legal status in the states, the U.S. Constitution did not recognize slavery in federal jurisdictions -- in the territories and on the high seas, for example. They also maintained that slaves did not represent a collective legal caste, but rather that slaveowners had claims only on the services of particular individuals. As “property” in service, slaves could be legally “confiscated” in wartime as a military necessity -- a strange way of justifying emancipation, to be sure, but one that allowed the Union to free slaves under existing law even before the 1863 Emancipation Proclamation. Legal thinking continued to shape abolition even after the war, when a fear that Southern states would simply re-legalize the practice led Republicans to push for a constitutional amendment to ban it forever.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

Bush, has been warning against what he sees as a destructive Republican flight from reality, as ideological purity has trumped pragmatic engagement. Frum is particularly scathing about the party’s nomination of unelectable Senate candidates, arguing that grass-roots radicalism cost the gop control of the Senate in 2010 and increased its losses in 2012. Frum’s polemics will not win many hearts and minds in the Tea Party, but his goal is less to win over his critics than to sound the alarm to a GOP establishment that, in his view, too readily gave the Tea Party kids the keys to the family car. As the party begins a reappraisal, the clear and coherent arguments in this passionately argued book will help shape the debate. But the Tea Party remains formidable, and balancing the demands of party bases with the values of the American center is a perennial problem in U.S. politics, and one that has never been easily solved.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

The Marine ethos was defined by a commitment to toughness ingrained at boot camp and a willingness to suffer reinforced by the high casualties the corps experienced in World War II and the Korean War. O’Connell does not shrink from describing the physical and mental toll this culture takes on individual marines and the violent behavior, drunkenness, and domestic abuse that represent its dark side. He also details the organization’s relentless self-promotion, which helped turn it from the least to the most admired of the services and guaranteed its independence. The corps has a deserved reputation for assiduously cultivating politicians, journalists, and filmmakers to help burnish its public image and win bipartisan support on Capitol Hill. This is an honest, but not unsympathetic, take on the Marines and a fine contribution to the study of military culture.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

He has crafted a lucid, original take on World War II that also offers insights on broader issues of strategy and war. His simple but striking proposition is that the Allied victory rested not only on the work of grand strategists in presidential cabinets and high military commands but also on the efforts of middle managers, such as the logisticians, engineers, and operational analysts who addressed the major obstacles to success: getting convoys across the Atlantic, coping with Germany’s blitzkrieg tactics, and sustaining a campaign over vast distances in the Pacific. With sound analysis of intelligence reports and a readiness to experiment with new methods and equipment, these managers made victory possible. Kennedy’s argument clarifies that it was not just bravery at the frontlines or superior productivity that gave the Allies an advantage over the Axis powers but also an organizational culture -- most evident in the United Kingdom, which was stretched the thinnest of the Allies -- that “contained impressive feedback loops, flexibility, a capacity to learn from mistakes,” and a willingness to encourage innovation and cross institutional boundaries.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

Bush to Barack Obama","In narrating the history of the U.S. occupation of Iraq, Gordon and Trainor finish the job they started in Cobra II, their 2006 book on the origins of the Iraq war. Their Iraqi and American sources are extraordinary, allowing them to describe events with an enormous, and sometimes overwhelming, amount of detail. They focus on the military struggle, describing U.S. commanders coping with varied forms of violence while their civilian colleagues come to terms with the complexities of post-Saddam Iraqi politics. The Americans had to relearn the painful lessons of counterinsurgency as, gradually, the strategy and tactics that came to be known as “the surge” fell into place. Gordon and Trainor are on the side of those who believe that the surge made a crucial difference; it took advantage of developments such as the anti-jihadist Sunni Awakening movement in Anbar Province and then used the momentum gained to push aside Shiite militants. They concede, however, that the momentum was insufficient to produce the inclusive Iraqi government that the United States sought.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

Hiding in the shadows and emerging to attack where they are least expected, they seek to cause enough pain to persuade their enemies to give up. Boot’s coverage is remarkably comprehensive, taking in revolutionary movements and anticolonial resistance campaigns, special forces working behind enemy lines and large-scale counterinsurgency operations, the revolts of Bar Kokhba and Robert the Bruce, the political violence of John Brown and that of the Ku Klux Klan, and charismatic guerrillas such as T. E. Lawrence and Che Guevara. Boot sustains the reader’s interest with lively writing and sharp characterizations, including detailed riffs on the personal hygiene and sex lives of guerrillas. His conclusions confirm that although guerrillas, insurgents, and terrorists have had their successes, the strong normally prevail over the weak. Invisible armies work best when they are able to build up visible political support and link up with (or become) even more visible conventional forces.

Battles were often bloody and vicious, but at least they produced definitive conclusions without spilling over into the rest of the country. Whitman knows it is pointless to wax nostalgic for a past form of warfare that might have worked for absolute monarchs but would hardly be suited to the modern world. Still, comparing earlier wars with contemporary “fights to the finish” allows him to ruminate about the possibilities for restraint in war and to challenge international lawyers to develop a “law of victory” that would support agreement on who had won a war and what was gained as a result.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

In contrast, this book focuses on particular leaders who launched successful efforts to help the poorest (usually rural) members of their societies, drawing attention to the consummate political skills necessary to implement even well-conceived policies. In detailed case studies, the authors examine the records of three leaders: Yoweri Museveni, the president of Uganda since 1986; Fernando Henrique Cardoso, the president of Brazil between 1995 and 2002; and Digvijay Singh, the chief minister of Madhya Pradesh, an Indian state of 60 million people, between 1993 and 2003. Although the details of their approaches differed, all three men had been committed to alleviating poverty before they won high office and, once in power, engaged the poor in political decision-making -- partly to learn what the poor most wanted and partly to increase the accountability of otherwise corrupt local politicians and government officials. All three also moved to the political center, stressed the importance of private investment, and put heavy emphasis on primary education for the poor.

But Raustiala and Sprigman argue that imitation -- which music labels and movie studios often consider theft -- frequently stimulates creativity rather than discouraging it. In this engaging text, the authors draw on the experience of many industries -- fashion, cuisine, finance, and open-source software, among others -- to demonstrate that a lack of effective copyright protection hardly throttles innovation and in fact encourages it. They draw a distinction between “pioneers,” who develop significant new designs or formulations, and “tweakers,” who make incremental improvements in new concepts and who would be inhibited if intellectual property rules were more tightly drawn and enforced. Traditional music labels have decried the copying of recorded music, arguing that it discourages the composition and performance of new music. According to the authors, that is simply not the case: it is the traditional business model of the labels that is under threat, not the production of music. And copyright was conceived to protect creative activity, not particular business models.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

Drawing on the experience of many countries, especially China, he argues for an active role for government in fostering development, not only through the traditional provision of infrastructure and the enforcement of rules but also in identifying and supporting industries that contribute to growth. But Lin’s embrace of that latter, more controversial form of government involvement comes with a critical proviso, one that has too often been ignored by past development planners: the industries a government chooses to support must exploit a country’s latent comparative advantage, as determined mainly by its endowments of land, labor, capital, and resources. A government can often select the appropriate industries to support by following the lead of similarly endowed countries that enjoy roughly twice the per capita income. Lin presents a thought-provoking argument. The book surprisingly contains no equations or tables, although it draws on a rich academic literature on development.

36,Doing Capitalism in the Innovation Economy,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2012-12-27/doing-capitalism-innovation-economy,Doing Capitalism in the Innovation Economy,"In this engaging book, Janeway, a venture capitalist who trained as an economist, combines his academic erudition with lessons learned during 40 years of working in the financial sector. His novel argument is that financial bubbles can be expected to occur from time to time in modern economies and that on balance they contribute to positive economic transformations by financing new technologies, even though many of them inevitably prove to be false starts or dead ends. Irrational exuberance, although not grounded in close assessments of balance sheets or plausible prospective earnings, is perhaps a necessary component of a dynamic economy, driving what the economist Joseph Schumpeter (following Karl Marx) famously termed “creative destruction.” Janeway also asserts that government plays three necessary roles in the development of an innovative economy. Government promotes the basic research that fuels innovation and nurtures the talent and skills to develop it: think of the Pentagon’s role in the evolution of information technology or the National Institutes of Health’s contributions to contemporary medicine. It also helps stabilize the economy when private demand fails to fully employ a country’s resources. Finally, government limits the damage to the economy caused by unavoidable episodic financial bubbles. Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

The world’s population is expected to grow by 33 percent in the next three decades, and most potentially arable land, excluding rainforests, is already in use. Water sources are increasingly under strain in some densely populated regions. Can adequate food supplies be assured? Conway answers with a qualified yes. He explains that many known techniques for increasing yields have yet to be fully applied but that doing so will require the mobilization of significant scientific, educational, and organizational resources. Conway lays out the considerable agricultural achievements of the last half century—raising global grain production from 900 million to 2,500 million tons, for instance—and accessibly presents some of the latest scientific research on how to increase productivity even further, including making genetic improvements to crops and livestock.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

The authors collected here argue that the United States should pursue a peacetime “competitive strategy” by arraying defense forces in the region, staying ahead of Chinese military modernization, and looking for ways to exploit Chinese vulnerabilities and weaknesses. The authors are surely correct that the United States needs a long-term strategy if it intends to remain a leader and security provider in Asia. But for all its emphasis on the need for a comprehensive approach to the rise of China, the book remains rather narrowly focused on military modernization and force strategies. As the diplomat George Kennan argued when the United States began its strategic competition with the Soviet Union, the United States’ long-term success will hinge on the political, social, and economic fortunes of the West as much as on changes in military balances.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

Nuclear weapons are now integral to foreign and defense policies in the Middle East, South Asia, and East Asia, where governments have embraced them as necessary tools of regional stability and deterrence. Bracken argues that this emerging global nuclear system will make it impossible to eliminate nuclear weapons. The only solution is to “manage” the problem, and this requires new long-term strategic thinking and new political frameworks to deal with the regional rivalries in the Middle East and Asia that threaten to trigger nuclear escalation and proliferation. If there is a glimmer of optimism in Bracken’s analysis, it is that the major nuclear powers have largely succeeded in stabilizing their own nuclear rivalries and now share a common interest in containing regional rivalries among smaller states and in building a new global system of arms control.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

China and other countries in the East are catching up with the West, but their technocratic, authoritarian regimes increasingly suffer from political illegitimacy and corruption. Meanwhile, the United States and other Western countries are struggling to reconcile liberal democracy with the complex demands of global economic and technological interdependence, failing to manage deficits and debt and to address growing income inequality. Berggruen and Gardels argue for a “middle way”: a synthetic approach to governance in which “China would need to lighten up while the [United States] would need to tighten up.” The book identifies virtues and defects in both the Chinese and the American systems and speculates about a hybrid model of government that would preserve Western constitutional democracy but build in more room for Eastern-style “accountable meritocracy.” Yet the authors are a bit elusive when it comes to how this model would actually function.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

But the authoritarian and autocratic states that have survived appear to be stubbornly dug in. In this engaging book, Dobson reports from such outposts of despotism as China, Malaysia, Russia, and Venezuela, detailing authoritarian regimes that are remarkably sophisticated in resisting the formidable forces that have put illiberal states on the defensive: Western democracy promoters, the international human rights movement, and the spread of social media. Modern autocrats increasingly eschew overtly oppressive methods of control, such as mass arrests and executions, and instead manipulate legal systems—tax rules, health codes, media regulations—to isolate and undermine opponents. Appearances increasingly matter, so today’s authoritarians hold rigged elections and pay lip service to democracy to distract attention from their abuses. Dobson does not speculate on how this new phase of the grand struggle between liberal democracy and dictatorship will end. But he does make clear that modern tyrants—just like the old ones—fear nothing more than the people.

But how do they understand that order? This valuable collection explores thinking about foreign policy in China, India, Iran, Japan, and Russia. The contributors demonstrate that in all those countries, vigorous debates exist among foreign policy schools that resemble the Western categories of realism, nationalism, and liberal internationalism, as well as various types of idealism. In their chapter, Nau and Ollapally argue that in most of these countries, realist and nationalist sentiments tend to dominate among foreign policy elites, leading to an emphasis on sovereignty, self-reliance, and the building of national military and economic capacities. But a strong consensus exists within all these countries—and even among the various schools of thought—on the virtues of international economic openness and integration. Moreover, apart from Iran, these rising states are not seeking to transform the global order. They want to trade and grow within the existing system while protecting their sovereignty and national power.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

In The Sandinistas and Nicaragua Since 1979, scholars sympathetic to the Nicaraguan revolution of the 1980s grapple with the transformation of the Sandinistas from youthful idealists into powerful elites enjoying unprincipled privileges. The Education of a Radical attributes this familiar transition to the limitations of political ideology and the inherent imperfections of human nature."

Nevertheless, their per capita growth rates remain too sluggish to close the wide income gaps between them and the developed nations. Interestingly, the authors propose raising tax rates on both individuals and corporations to enable underfunded governments to increase investments in education and other public goods. Far from simply suggesting that governments get out of the way, the authors recognize the importance of strong regulatory bodies that can oversee banking, competition policies, and tax collection. But readers looking for prescriptions for even more activist government policies—to spur investment in particular industrial sectors, for instance—will be disappointed. Indeed, the IMF economists argue that reducing the level of government intervention in other markets, such as agriculture and electricity, would improve efficiency and productivity.

Vol. 1,"In this collection, scholars with the influential Chinese Academy of Sciences offer some interesting but dryly presented perspectives on the surge of Chinese activities in Latin America. Their analyses range from pleasantly realistic, to contradictory, to naive. As an emerging global power, China has proudly established “strategic partnerships” with at least five Latin American states, but the scholars here profess that China presents no threat to traditional U.S. interests in the region. Rather, Chinese firms simply wish to diversify their sources of raw materials and in some cases to sell to domestic markets—and, to be sure, it is true that Latin America’s shoddy infrastructure presents profitable opportunities for Chinese construction firms. Notably, the scholars are wary of left-wing nationalist Latin American governments whose erratic economic policies create risks for Chinese firms; they also worry that “once Venezuela has a change of government, [its] present foreign policy with China may be halted.” And despite its economic promise, Brazil nevertheless “lacks strong comprehensive national strength.” But the basic message—that China’s advance into Latin America has only just begun—is utterly credible.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

Historically, heavy U.S. interventionism, so visible in nations close to the United States, has not been visited on South America—because, Teixeira demonstrates, Brazil has protected core U.S. interests there. During the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the United States applied the interventionist Monroe Doctrine to the Caribbean basin but not to South America, where Brazil could be relied on to maintain stability. During the Cold War, Teixeira claims, Washington could “neglect” South America because Brazil’s anticommunist military dictatorship thwarted nearby leftist regimes on its own, intervening even more decisively than the United States did to prevent the rise of leftists in Bolivia and Chile in the 1970s and even preparing to invade Uruguay early in that decade. But Brazil’s collaboration has been conditioned on U.S. respect for Brazil’s interests in its neighborhood. Consequently, when the Clinton administration threatened Brazil’s subregional hegemony by advancing free trade throughout the Americas, Brazil pushed back, and Washington relented. Teixeira may overstate the heft of Brazilian diplomacy and the enthusiasm of other South American states for Brazilian leadership, but his inspired insights demand the revision of much conventional wisdom regarding inter-American relations.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

Somewhat overshadowed, at least abroad, by his longtime political partner Recep Tayyip Erdogan -- Turkey's prime minister and leader of the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) -- Gul has recently started to carve out a more independent political identity. While Erdogan has become increasingly strident and authoritarian since taking office in 2003, especially as the AKP's parliamentary majorities have grown, Gul -- although personally pious and traditional (he married his wife when she was 15 and he was 30) -- has quietly pursued a more moderate and progressive path. A former foreign minister and prime minister himself, Turkey's head of state and commander in chief has raised his stature (and popularity) by embracing seemingly contradictory principles: defending both Turkey's Muslim identity and its pluralistic values, challenging his own government's antidemocratic excesses, championing the rule of law, and helping reorient his country's foreign policy eastward while remaining a forceful advocate of integration with Europe.

President Barack Obama; his Republican rival, Mitt Romney; and their surrogates relentlessly sparred over who should pay what taxes, who should get what benefits, and how Washington should manage major sectors of life, such as health care and education. What neither side made clear was how the United States stacks up against other developed countries. As other countries embraced big government and generous social policies in the middle of the twentieth century, the common wisdom goes, the United States sought a relatively small welfare state. And for partisans on both sides of the aisle, one of the key issues up for grabs on November 6 was whether such American exceptionalism would persist or fade away."

But U.S. leaders have explicitly rejected that course of action. ""Make no mistake: a nuclear-armed Iran is not a challenge that can be contained,"" U.S. President Barack Obama told the UN General Assembly last September. ""And that's why the United States will do what we must to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon."" U.S. officials have also made it clear that they consider direct military action to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon an extremely unattractive option, one to be implemented only as a regrettable last resort."

As defense minister in the current government, Barak prosecuted the November Gaza campaign, handles the Palestinian brief, and, along with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, gets the last word on whether to attack Iran -- Israel's most pressing security concern despite the recent focus on Hamas. Given the pariah status of Israel's foreign minister, Avigdor Lieberman, Barak, a frequent presence in Washington, essentially covers that portfolio as well. Yet despite 35 years of military service and more than a decade in public life, Barak remains something of a cipher -- a man one of Israel's leading columnists, Ari Shavit, compares to a stealth bomber (""the usual radar doesn't capture him"").

Fledgling democracies in North Africa are struggling to move forward or even maintain control, government crackdowns in the Persian Gulf and elsewhere have kept liberalization at bay, and Syria is slipping ever deeper into a vicious civil war that threatens to ignite the Middle East. Instead of widespread elation about democracy finally coming to the region, one now hears pessimism about the many obstacles in the way, fear about what will happen next, and even open nostalgia for the old authoritarian order. Last June, when the Egyptian military dismissed parliament and tried to turn back the clock by gutting the civilian presidency, The Wall Street Journal's chief foreign policy columnist cracked, ""Let's hope it works.""

Secretary of State Hillary Clinton echoed these comments, expressing confidence that the transformations would allow Washington to advance ""security, stability, peace, and democracy"" in the Middle East. Not to be outdone, the Republican Party's 2012 platform trumpeted ""the historic nature of the events of the past two years—the Arab Spring—that have unleashed democratic movements leading to the overthrow of dictators who have been menaces to global security for decades."" Some saw the changes as heralding a long-awaited end to the Middle East's immunity to previous waves of global democratization; others proclaimed that al Qaeda and other radicals had finally lost the war of ideas."
54,Democratize or Die,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2012-12-03/democratize-or-die,Democratize or Die,"In 2011, standing in front of the Royal Society (the British academy of sciences), Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao declared, ""Tomorrow's China will be a country that fully achieves democracy, the rule of law, fairness, and justice. Without freedom, there is no real democracy. Without guarantee of economic and political rights, there is no real freedom."" Eric Li's article in these pages, ""The Life of the Party,"" pays no such lip service to democracy. Instead, Li, a Shanghai-based venture capitalist, declares that the debate over Chinese democratization is dead: the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) will not only stay in power; its success in the coming years will ""consolidate the one-party model and, in the process, challenge the West's conventional wisdom about political development."" Li might have called the race too soon."
55,The Life of the Party,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2012-12-03/life-party,The Life of the Party,"In November 2012, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) held its 18th National Congress, setting in motion a once-in-a-decade transfer of power to a new generation of leaders. As expected, Xi Jinping took over as general secretary and will become the president of the People's Republic this March. The turnover was a smooth and well-orchestrated demonstration by a confidently rising superpower. That didn't stop international media and even some Chinese intellectuals, however, from portraying it as a moment of crisis. In an issue that was published before the beginning of the congress, for example, The Economist quoted unnamed scholars at a recent conference as saying that China is ""unstable at the grass roots, dejected at the middle strata and out of control at the top."" To be sure, months before the handover, the scandal surrounding Bo Xilai, the former party boss of the Chongqing municipality, had shattered the CCP's long-held facade of unity, which had underwritten domestic political stability since the Tiananmen Square upheavals in 1989. To make matters worse, the Chinese economy, which had sustained double-digit GDP growth for two decades, slowed, decelerating for seven straight quarters. China's economic model of rapid industrialization, labor-intensive manufacturing, large-scale government investments in infrastructure, and export growth seemed to have nearly run its course. Some in China and the West have gone so far as to predict the demise of the one-party state, which they allege cannot survive if leading politicians stop delivering economic miracles."
56,Can America Be Fixed?,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2013-01-01/can-america-be-fixed,Can America Be Fixed?,"In November, the American electorate, deeply unhappy with Washington and its political gridlock, voted to maintain precisely the same distribution of power—returning President Barack Obama for a second term and restoring a Democratic Senate and a Republican House of Representatives. With at least the electoral uncertainty out of the way, attention quickly turned to how the country's lawmakers would address the immediate crisis known as the fiscal cliff—the impending end-of-year tax increases and government spending cuts mandated by earlier legislation."
57,Lean Forward,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2012-11-30/lean-forward,Lean Forward,"Since the end of World War II, the United States has pursued a single grand strategy: deep engagement. In an effort to protect its security and prosperity, the country has promoted a liberal economic order and established close defense ties with partners in Europe, East Asia, and the Middle East. Its military bases cover the map, its ships patrol transit routes across the globe, and tens of thousands of its troops stand guard in allied countries such as Germany, Japan, and South Korea."
58,Pull Back,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2013-01-01/pull-back,Pull Back,"Despite a decade of costly and indecisive warfare and mounting fiscal pressures, the long-standing consensus among American policymakers about U.S. grand strategy has remained remarkably intact. As the presidential campaign made clear, Republicans and Democrats may quibble over foreign policy at the margins, but they agree on the big picture: that the United States should dominate the world militarily, economically, and politically, as it has since the final years of the Cold War, a strategy of liberal hegemony. The country, they hold, needs to preserve its massive lead in the global balance of power, consolidate its economic preeminence, enlarge the community of market democracies, and maintain its outsized influence in the international institutions it helped create."
59,The Totalitarian Temptation,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/review-essay/2012-11-30/totalitarian-temptation,The Totalitarian Temptation,"One evening in June 1940, an excited crowd in Berlin awaited Adolf Hitler's arrival at the opera. The German army was scoring victory after victory in Europe at the time, and when the dictator finally entered the room, the audience greeted him with impassioned cries of ""Sieg Heil!"" ""Heil Hitler!"" and ""Heil Fuehrer!"" With the 1939 Nazi-Soviet Nonaggression Pact still in force, one of the attendees that night was Valentin Berezhkov, an interpreter for Stalin. ""As I am watching all that,"" he recalled in his memoirs, ""I am thinking to myself -- and the thought scares me -- how much there is in common between this and our congresses and conferences when Stalin makes his entry into the hall. The same thunderous, never-ending standing ovation. Almost the same hysterical shouts of 'Glory to Stalin!' 'Glory to our leader!'"""
60,Do Less Harm,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2012-01-01/do-less-harm,Do Less Harm,"Everyone knows that civilians suffer in war. Even in lawfully conducted conflicts waged for legitimate causes, they lose lives, limbs, and loved ones. What fewer understand is that there are no laws that oblige warring parties to help the civilians they've harmed, as long as the action that caused the harm is considered legal. A fighter jet can strike a weapons cache next to a home, a guard can shoot a suspicious biker at a checkpoint, and a convoy can speed through a playground, but so long as in each instance the armed forces follow the Geneva Conventions' rules of discrimination and proportionality, they never have to explain, apologize, or pay for those losses."
61,The Fall and Rise of the West,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/north-america/2012-11-30/fall-and-rise-west,The Fall and Rise of the West,"The 2008 financial crisis and the Great Recession that followed have had devastating effects on the U.S. economy and millions of American lives. But the U.S. economy will emerge from its trauma stronger and widely restructured. Europe should eventually experience a similar strengthening, although its future is less certain and its recovery will take longer to develop. The United States is much further along because its financial crisis struck three years before Europe's, in 2008, causing headwinds that have pressured it ever since. It will take another two to three years for these to subside, but after that, U.S. economic growth should outperform expectations. In contrast, Europe is still in the midst of its financial crisis. If historical logic prevails there, it will take four to six years for strong European growth to materialize."
62,Rebooting Republican Foreign Policy,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2013-01-01/rebooting-republican-foreign-policy,Rebooting Republican Foreign Policy,"This past fall was not kind to U.S. President Barack Obama's foreign policy. It became increasingly clear that Afghan security forces were not going to be ready for the 2014 transition. The New York Times highlighted the administration's failure to persuade the Iraqi government to allow a residual U.S. force to stay in the country, leaving Baghdad ever more at the mercy of Tehran. Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu fought publicly over how to respond to Iran's advancing nuclear program. The administration's much-touted ""pivot"" to the Pacific seemed like more talk than action, as the United States passively watched tensions rise between China and Japan. And then, the administration tripped over itself repeatedly in trying to explain the fiasco in Benghazi, Libya."
63,The End of the Age of Petraeus,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/afghanistan/2013-01-01/end-age-petraeus,The End of the Age of Petraeus,"The downfall of David Petraeus sent such shock waves through the policy establishment when it hit the news in November because the cause was so banal: the most celebrated and controversial military officer of our time compelled to resign from his dream job as CIA director as the result of an extramarital affair. Yet long after the headshaking details are forgotten, Petraeus' larger significance will remain, as his career traced one of the era's crucial strategic narratives -- the rise and fall of counterinsurgency in U.S. military policy."

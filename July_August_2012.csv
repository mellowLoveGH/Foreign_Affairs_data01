0,Why Iran Should Get the Bomb,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/iran/2012-06-15/why-iran-should-get-bomb,Why Iran Should Get the Bomb,"The past several months have witnessed a heated debate over the best way for the United States and Israel to respond to Iran's nuclear activities. As the argument has raged, the United States has tightened its already robust sanctions regime against the Islamic Republic, and the European Union announced in January that it will begin an embargo on Iranian oil on July 1. Although the United States, the EU, and Iran have recently returned to the negotiating table, a palpable sense of crisis still looms."
1,How Busted Is Brazil?,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/brazil/2012-07-01/how-busted-brazil,How Busted Is Brazil?,"Ruchir Sharma (""Bearish on Brazil,"" May/June 2012) argues that Brazil's incredible rise over the past ten years has depended on the sale of commodities, and that as commodity markets begin to slow, so, too, will Brazil's growth. Sharma correctly notes that in the coming years, Brazil will likely need to confront a decline in commodity purchases from China. But he fails to recognize that economic stability has also driven Brazil's growth."
2,Reading Putin,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/review-essay/2012-07-01/reading-putin,Reading Putin,"On the morning of May 7, Vladimir Putin glided through the empty streets of Moscow in a dark limousine, his motorcade making its way toward the Kremlin for his inauguration as Russia's president. There were no supporters lining the streets, no hecklers, or even curious passersby, for that matter; the police, fearful of protests, had virtually quarantined the city. The picture was of a man isolated in the soothing, if illusory, cradle of supreme power. As Putin took the oath to become president, an office he first occupied more than 12 years ago, he said, with a somber face, that serving Russia was ""the meaning of my whole life."""
3,Trading Up in Asia,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2012-07-01/trading-asia,Trading Up in Asia,"As the Doha Round of global trade talks nears its 12th year with no end in sight, the negotiations have all but failed. Frustrated with Doha’s stagnation and eager to expand trade and secure alliances, the United States has signed a series of bilateral free-trade agreements (FTAs), culminating in last year’s pacts with Colombia, Panama, and South Korea. These deals have been generally favorable to the United States; the agreement with South Korea is expected to increase trade between the two countries by billions of dollars and create tens of thousands of jobs for each."
4,Robespierre’s Rules for Radicals,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/robespierres-rules-radicals,Robespierre’s Rules for Radicals,"Revolutionary France in 1794 was a crucible, combining all the elements that would embody Western politics in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. All eyes were on Paris. Depending on who was looking, Maximilien Robespierre was either a hero or a villain. Robespierre, once an obscure lawyer from northern France, had in four short years transformed himself, or so it seemed, into the chief architect of the transition from the hated ancien régime to an uncertain new order. That new order was threatened by invading armies from neighboring countries, counterrevolutionaries in the Vendée region, and intense divisions within the revolutionary ranks, including the Jacobin faction to which Robespierre belonged. The Catholic and conservative right feared the idea of a republic and desired a return to stability. The left wanted to create a virtuous society -- but also simply wanted more bread. Welcome to modern politics."
5,Confucius and the Ballot Box,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/review-essay/2012-06-18/confucius-and-ballot-box,Confucius and the Ballot Box,"Beginning in the mid-1980s, the so-called third wave of democratization swept through Asia, bringing vibrant multiparty politics to former autocracies such as South Korea and Taiwan. Yet today, by Doh Chull Shin's count, the 16 countries of East and Southeast Asia now include only six functioning democracies -- a ratio worse than the worldwide average of six democracies for every ten countries. The region hosts some of the world's most resilient authoritarian regimes; meanwhile, Cambodia, the Philippines, and Thailand have toggled between elected and unelected governments, and China's economic success and political stability have made the country a model studied enviously by strongmen around the world. What is it about Asia that makes it so hard for democracy to take root?"
6,How India Stumbled,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/india/2012-06-18/how-india-stumbled,How India Stumbled,"When the United Progressive Alliance, a group of center-left parties led by the Indian National Congress, came to power for a second term in 2009, it seemed that India could do no wrong. The economy had sailed through the worst of the global economic recession with GDP growing at a fast seven percent annually and accelerating (it reached 10.4 percent in 2010). Inflation was low, officials were finally starting to take India's social problems seriously, and politics in the world's largest democracy were contentious but robust. The rest of the world was even looking to the country as a serious global power. ""India is not simply emerging,"" U.S. President Barack Obama told the Indian parliament in November 2010; ""India has emerged."""
7,Obama's New Global Posture,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2012-06-14/obamas-new-global-posture,Obama’s New Global Posture,"Tough economic times have often been met in the United States by calls for a more modest foreign policy. But despite the global economic downturn, in today's interdependent world, retrenchment would be misguided. The United States' ability to lead the international community is still invaluable and unmatched. Its economy is still by far the largest, most developed, and most dynamic in the world. Its military remains much more capable than any other. The United States' network of alliances and partnerships ensures that the country rarely has to act alone. And its soft power reflects the sustained appeal of American values. The United States should not reduce its overseas engagement when it is in a position to actively shape the global environment to secure its interests."
8,Pie in the Sky,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/space/2012-06-18/pie-sky,Pie in the Sky,"Neil deGrasse Tyson’s attempt (“The Case for Space,” March/April 2012) to revive the bellicose spirit of the 1960s in order to foster a U.S. space race with China brings to mind General “Buck” Turgidson’s remarks about “a mineshaft gap” in Dr. Strangelove. If one were tempted to think that the director Stanley Kubrick’s dark satire was dated, doubt no more."
9,When Military Advisers Fail,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/vietnam/2012-06-18/when-military-advisers-fail,When Military Advisers Fail,"In their article “War Downsized” (March/April 2012), Carter Malkasian and J. Kael Weston point to the United States’ “long and successful history of deploying advisers to fight insurgencies abroad.” They mention effective operations in the Philippines, El Salvador, and Colombia and suggest that such a strategy be emulated in Afghanistan."
10,Save the Chimps,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/west-africa/2012-06-18/save-chimps,Save the Chimps,"Miyun Park and Peter Singer’s recent essay (“The Globalization of Animal Welfare,” March/April 2012) focuses entirely on domesticated animals and thus makes an easily forgivable mistake. The essayists claim that “of the mammals eaten by humans, pigs . . . may be the most intelligent.”"

13,The Right Way Out of Afghanistan,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/afghanistan/2012-07-01/right-way-out-afghanistan,The Right Way Out of Afghanistan,"The signing in May of a strategic partnership agreement between the United States and Afghanistan came at a tense time in the Afghan war. As NATO and the International Security Assistance Force work to transfer security responsibility for much of the country to the Afghan government, the agreement establishes the contours of a long-term relationship and a framework for future cooperation. But it notably leaves out details on the levels of forces and funding the United States will commit to Afghanistan after 2014. Meanwhile, insurgents continue to mount frequent attacks against high-visibility targets throughout the country and have assassinated international personnel and Afghans with ties to the government of President Hamid Karzai. Trust between the U.S. and Afghan governments has eroded as a result of Afghan civilian casualties, attacks on U.S. and other international forces by Afghan troops, and blunders by U.S. military personnel, including the burning of Korans at an air base."
14,Europe's Optional Catastrophe,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/germany/2012-07-01/europes-optional-catastrophe,Europe’s Optional Catastrophe,"Two decades ago, when the European currency system was last on the brink of collapse, the ultimate question was how much Germany, the continent's economic powerhouse, would do to save it. The peripheral economies were hurting, weighed down by a monetary policy that was appropriate for Germany but too austere for weaker European countries. Germany's central bank, the Bundesbank, had to make a choice. It could continue to set high interest rates, thus upholding its commitment to stable prices. Or it could cut rates and accept modest inflation -- and so save the rest of Europe from a prolonged recession."
15,Deterrence Lessons From Iraq,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/iraq/2012-07-01/deterrence-lessons-iraq,Deterrence Lessons From Iraq,"As Iran continues its pursuit of a nuclear capability, outside observers have debated just how worried the world should be. Optimists argue that since nuclear war would be suicidal, no government would ever risk it, and they think the Islamic Republic would be no exception. Pessimists argue that Iran's radical and unstable regime might behave in unpredictable ways and cannot be trusted. Both camps seem to agree that rationality is the key to deterrence; they disagree over whether a nuclear Iran would be rational."

17,Fixing Finance,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/fixing-finance,Fixing Finance,"A few years ago, while looking at the Journal of Economic Literature, the weighty compendium that tracks economic research, the economist James Galbraith spotted a curious omission. Although the journal monitors work on income inequality and on financial stability, he explains in his new book, before the recent financial crisis, ""there was (and is) no category for work relating inequality to the financial system."""
18,Hegemony and After,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/review-essay/2012-07-01/hegemony-and-after,Hegemony and After,"Playing a dominant role in world politics does not make for an easy life. Even very powerful states encounter problems they cannot solve and situations they would prefer to avoid. But as Macbeth remarks after seeing the witches, ""Present fears are less than horrible imaginings."" What really scares American foreign policy commentators is not any immediate frustration or danger but the prospect of longer-term decline."
19,Cleaning Up Coal,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2012-06-18/cleaning-coal,Cleaning Up Coal,"Coal, the rock that fueled the industrial age, is once again remaking the global energy landscape. Over the past decade, while most of the world stood transfixed by the gyrations of the oil markets, the promise of alternative energy, and the boom in cheap natural gas, coal left all other forms of energy in its dust, contributing nearly as much total energy to the global economy as every other source combined."
20,How to Succeed in Business,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/world/how-succeed-business,How to Succeed in Business,"On October 19, 2011, the government of Afghanistan -- acting in part on the recommendation of U.S. military advisers working with the Afghan Ministry of Mines -- granted a license to the China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) to develop several oil fields in northern Afghanistan. Just three years earlier, another state-owned Chinese company, the China Metallurgical Group Corporation, won the rights to develop Afghanistan's Aynak copper deposit, one of the largest in the world, again with American acquiescence."
21,"Environmental Alarmism, Then and Now",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/world/environmental-alarmism-then-and-now,"Environmental Alarmism, Then and Now","Forty years ago, humanity was warned: by chasing ever-greater economic growth, it was sentencing itself to catastrophe. The Club of Rome, a blue-ribbon multinational collection of business leaders, scholars, and government officials brought together by the Italian tycoon Aurelio Peccei, made the case in a slim 1972 volume called The Limits to Growth. Based on forecasts from an intricate series of computer models developed by professors at MIT, the book caused a sensation and captured the zeitgeist of the era: the belief that mankind's escalating wants were on a collision course with the world's finite resources and that the crash would be coming soon."
22,The Cuban Missile Crisis at 50,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/cuba/2012-07-01/cuban-missile-crisis-50,The Cuban Missile Crisis at 50,"Fifty years ago, the Cuban missile crisis brought the world to the brink of nuclear disaster. During the standoff, U.S. President John F. Kennedy thought the chance of escalation to war was ""between 1 in 3 and even,"" and what we have learned in later decades has done nothing to lengthen those odds. We now know, for example, that in addition to nuclear-armed ballistic missiles, the Soviet Union had deployed 100 tactical nuclear weapons to Cuba, and the local Soviet commander there could have launched these weapons without additional codes or commands from Moscow. The U.S. air strike and invasion that were scheduled for the third week of the confrontation would likely have triggered a nuclear response against American ships and troops, and perhaps even Miami. The resulting war might have led to the deaths of 100 million Americans and over 100 million Russians."

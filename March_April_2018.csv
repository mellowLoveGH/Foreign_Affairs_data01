0,Letting Go,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/issue-packages/2018-02-13/letting-go,What’s Inside,"Nobody really knew what to expect when Donald Trump became U.S. president. Would he disrupt the status quo or maintain it? Blow himself up or escape unscathed? One year in, the answer is yes. If you squint, U.S. foreign policy during the Trump era can seem almost normal. But the closer you look, the more you see it being hollowed out, with the forms and structures still in place but the substance and purpose draining away. The best analogy might be to health care—something else the administration came in hell-bent on overhauling, only to find it more difficult than expected. In foreign policy, too, the Trump administration came to power promising a revolution. But the White House has failed to kill the existing approach outright and has grudgingly contented itself with hopes that it will die of neglect anyway. In the board game Diplomacy, the rules state that “if a player leaves the game, or otherwise fails to submit orders,” the player’s country is deemed to be in “civil disorder.” The country’s pieces stand in place, defend themselves if attacked, and let the game proceed around them. That’s basically what’s happening with the United States now. Confronted with this unprecedented situation, Eliot Cohen concedes that to date, the administration’s foreign policy might be considered “a highly erratic, obnoxious version of the Republican normal.” But he argues that this is because the bill for the administration’s unconventional behavior has not yet arrived. Jake Sullivan examines the surprising resilience of the liberal international order, which has managed to take a licking and keep on ticking—so far. Other countries appreciate what the United States created, even if Washington doesn’t. Barry Posen suggests that consciously or not, the Trump administration is following a new grand strategy, one of illiberal hegemony. It has “pared or abandoned many of the pillars of liberal internationalism” but “still seeks to retain the United States’ superior economic and military capability and role as security arbiter for most regions of the world.” Adam Posen sees the global economy moving forward calmly and steadily, with broad-based growth nally kicking in. But here, too, problems have been deferred, and a prolonged abdication of U.S. leadership will cause real trouble. And Sarah Margon traces the decline of human rights as a concern in this White House, as even the pretense of caring about other countries’ misbehavior has been dropped and the president embraces a new crop of friendly tyrants. Trying to rule the world by dominance rather than persuasion has not worked well in the past, and there is little doubt that if tried again, it will fail again. The rules of Diplomacy note that civil disorder does not have to be permanent: “A player who temporarily fails to submit orders may, of course, resume play if he returns to the game and still has some units left.” What the world will look like when that eventually happens is anybody’s guess."
1,"Burkina Faso: A History of Power, Protest, and Revolution",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2018-02-13/burkina-faso-history-power-protest-and-revolution,"Burkina Faso: A History of Power, Protest, and Revolution","Harsch’s is the first English-language political history of Burkina Faso to appear in many years. It is a superb introduction to this small, landlocked country in the Sahel region, covering the precolonial era, the era of French colonization, and the postcolonial period, culminating in a popular uprising in 2014 that forced out the country’s longtime dictator, Blaise Compaoré. The heart of the book is a glowing assessment of the regime of Thomas Sankara, an idealistic junior military officer who took power following a coup in 1983 and ruled until he was ousted by Compaoré in 1987. Sankara’s status as a Third World revolutionary icon rests on his personal charisma, his considerable skill as an orator, and the relative success of the socialist reforms his regime put in place, which Harsch describes in extremely favorable terms. Harsch ends the book on a note of tempered optimism. The army has run the country for most of its postcolonial history and has instilled in the Burkinabe state a paternalistic culture of control that is not compatible with its limited capacities. But Harsch believes that the protests that helped topple Compaoré invigorated civil society in a way that will force greater accountability in future governments."

The number of international tourists arriving on the continent increased from 24 million between 1995 and 1998 to 56 million between 2011 and 2014; the revenue they generated in the respective periods rose from $14 billon to around $47 billion. Tourism now accounts for 8.5 percent of the continent’s GDP. Such numbers are still relatively small, and the benefits of tourism are distributed unevenly: the poorer countries of central and western Africa receive far fewer visitors than the middle-income countries of northern and southern Africa. But the report makes a strong case for the potential of tourism, a relatively labor-intensive industry that can create significant employment possibilities, including for skilled workers. In addition, the report suggests that growth in tourism is likely to boost other sectors of African economies, in part by spurring investment in human capital and in physical and communications infrastructure."

MacEachern situates Boko Haram, the Islamic State affiliate based in Nigeria, in the history of a complex region that includes parts of four countries: southern Chad, northern Cameroon, northeastern Nigeria, and southeastern Niger. This is a borderland between the Sahara to the north, where Islam prevails, and the savanna and forest areas to the south, which are home to various animist traditions. Boko Haram’s leadership is currently thought to have retreated to the Mandara Mountains, on the Nigerian-Cameroonian border, which MacEachern demonstrates have long been a haven for smugglers, slave traders, and various militias. His book explores the interesting parallels between Boko Haram and Hamman Yaji, a notorious warlord who, in the early twentieth century, struck out from his stronghold in the Mandaras to attack local communities and enslave young women—just like Boko Haram. It comes as no surprise, then, that local residents interpret Boko Haram through the lens of the story of Hamman Yaji, as MacEachern reports."

The effort was led by a Barcelona-based talent scout whose claim to fame was that he had discovered perhaps the most famous soccer player of the current era, the Argentine forward Lionel Messi. Abbot’s book follows the fortunes of three young African players who participated in the Qatari program and for whom soccer represented a ticket out of poverty. In the end, none of the three made it: it turns out that it is hard to predict who will be the next Messi, particularly in countries where it is easy to forge a birth certificate and convince a scout that a 12-year-old is actually 16. African recruits have become stars on many of the world’s top professional teams, but a far more common trajectory for them involves shameless exploitation by a motley assortment of fixers, coaches, scouts, and other intermediaries who all hope to profit off the players. Abbot’s book is an excellent introduction to this shady world."
5,The Broken Ladder: The Paradox and Potential of India’s One Billion,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2018-02-13/broken-ladder-paradox-and-potential-indias-one-billion,The Broken Ladder: The Paradox and Potential of India’s One Billion,"Krishna examines the wasted potential of the two-thirds of the Indian population that is effectively locked up in villages by a lack of education, networks, and job opportunities. The belief that they can’t move up in society is well founded but also self-reinforcing, and Krishna argues that India will never succeed without tapping this reservoir of talent. With a mix of data and vivid anecdotes, he shows why the problem can’t be fixed with macro-level policies, such as easing licensing requirements, courting foreign investment, and building roads and schools. The bottom-up policies that he suggests—local control of school boards, village-level mentorship programs, internships for village children in cities, more rural libraries, empowered field-level officials and new local institutions to hold them accountable—are rooted in his development experience and aim to transform a culture of hopelessness. But it’s not clear who will carry out those steps in a country whose government and elites remain wedded to a city-centric development model."
6,"The China Mission: George Marshall’s Unfinished War, 1945–1947",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2018-02-13/china-mission-george-marshalls-unfinished-war-1945-1947,"The China Mission: George Marshall’s Unfinished War, 1945–1947","In the 1940s, China was filled with towering personalities who left behind highly quotable archives. Kurtz-Phelan, the executive editor of this magazine, has produced an intimate portrait of U.S. General George Marshall’s year-long mediation effort, launched in 1946, to stave off civil war between the Nationalists and the Communists. The book is at once a character study of the charismatic and dedicated Marshall; a narrative account of the mission’s miraculous early successes and prolonged, painful collapse; and a meditation on the impossibility of reconciling parties that are determined to remain enemies. In Kurtz-Phelan’s telling, most of the blame for the peace effort’s failure falls on the Nationalist leader Chiang Kai-shek, who refused to remedy the misrule that ultimately doomed his regime. But a deeper obstacle was Washington’s inability to uphold the mediator’s core requirement of neutrality. Both Chiang and the Chinese Communist Party chief, Mao Zedong, could see that Marshall’s true purpose was to get the Communists to accept continued Nationalist rule so that China would remain aligned with the United States. This might have been a reasonable goal if one believed the Communists could not win the civil war. But Mao did not accept that premise—and he turned out to be right."
7,Thailand: Shifting Ground Between the US and a Rising China,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2018-02-13/thailand-shifting-ground-between-us-and-rising-china,Thailand: Shifting Ground Between the US and a Rising China,"Zawacki indicts U.S. policy in Thailand since the turn of the century for ceding influence to a rising China. Thailand is important to the United States for trade and for the U.S. military facilities the country hosts, and to China for the access route it provides to the South China Sea and the Bay of Bengal. Even though Thai elites are polarized between the populist Red Shirt movement and the royalist-cum-militaristic Yellow Shirt movement, both sides approve of Chinese-style authoritarian capitalist development, and this has led to more trade, cooperation on infrastructure, and weapons sales between China and Thailand. Zawacki believes that the erosion of U.S. influence could have been stemmed if the State Department and the Pentagon, backed by academia, had fielded a cadre of Thai experts who spent the time necessary to understand the country and build trust. He himself has done so. Although the book overwhelms the reader with details in some places, Zawacki’s frank interviews with scores of former and current officials offer insight into the reasons why Thai elites have shifted from a pro-U.S. alignment to a tilt toward China."
8,"Authoritarian Legality in China: Law, Workers, and the State",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2018-02-13/authoritarian-legality-china-law-workers-and-state,"Authoritarian Legality in China: Law, Workers, and the State","China’s 2008 Labor Contract Law and 2011 Social Insurance Law set high labor-protection standards for factories and for local governments that had powered their export-driven economies with cheap, temporary migrant labor from rural areas. Yet the central government has not enforced the laws, empowered the official labor union to enforce them, or tolerated the formation of independent unions. Instead, workers can pursue their rights only by undertaking mediation or arbitration or by suing in court. Gallagher argues that the government’s purpose in providing “expansive rights that are weakly protected” is to use workers as a “strategic lever” to force enterprises and local authorities to take on higher labor and welfare costs without giving workers the tools to create fundamental change. As is true elsewhere in the Chinese system, officials use laws more to articulate policy goals than to regulate behavior. But such “authoritarian legality” has created its own inconsistency: workers expect more protection than they actually get, so labor protests have increased. The regime now faces a choice between giving workers more power to fight for their interests or cutting back on legal protections. Gallagher says the government is considering the latter option."
9,Japanese War Criminals: The Politics of Justice After the Second World War,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2018-02-13/japanese-war-criminals-politics-justice-after-second-world-war,Japanese War Criminals: The Politics of Justice After the Second World War,"Although studied less often than the Nuremberg trials, the prosecution of Japanese war criminals after World War II was a major undertaking. The United States and its European allies tried 5,707 people; 4,524 were found guilty. (Few data are available regarding people prosecuted by the Chinese and the Soviets.) This legal and political history explores with exemplary nuance and clarity how the Allies handled difficult issues, such as the boundaries of necessary violence in war and the limits of command responsibility, thus forging new precedents for international law. It also shows how attitudes toward the trials changed as Japan became a Western ally during the Cold War, leading to the release of all Japanese prisoners by the late 1950s. For several reasons, the trials did not produce the kind of acceptance of historical guilt among Japanese that the trials of Germans yielded in Germany. The Japanese were less inclined to view their actions as unprovoked aggression, because many thought the West had started the conflict when it tried to strangle Japan’s access to resources. The Japanese had not committed ethnic genocide, so they were tried only for the kinds of crimes that the Allies themselves had committed before or during the war, leading many to see the trials as victors’ justice."

In the 1890s, Afghanistan’s Pashtun leader, Abdur Rahman Khan, perpetrated what can be legitimately termed a genocide against the Hazaras: killing, enslaving, and dispossessing the bulk of the population. For decades afterward, the Hazaras were at the bottom of what Ibrahimi, in this sympathetic but nonpolemic book, calls a caste system. Despite the absence of an official census, the Hazaras today are estimated to represent somewhere between ten and 20 percent of Afghanistan’s roughly 30 million inhabitants. Their homeland, in the middle of the country, is grossly underdeveloped. Ibrahimi has undertaken field and archival research to trace the efforts of the Hazaras to protect their identity and patrimony and to find a legitimate place in the Afghan state. The Hazaras were recognized as a group by the 2004 Afghan constitution. They hold ministerial positions and have elected representatives to the national assembly. It takes a strong state, Ibrahimi avers, to mitigate ethnic politics, but a strong state will almost inevitably be an instrument of the Pashtuns, the group to which the fiercely anti-Shiite Taliban belong."
11,Kings and Presidents: Saudi Arabia and the United States Since FDR,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2018-02-13/kings-and-presidents-saudi-arabia-and-united-states-fdr,Kings and Presidents: Saudi Arabia and the United States Since FDR,"The U.S.-Saudi alliance is peculiar. It began with a 1945 meeting between U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt and King Ibn Saud and has always rested, as Riedel states, “on shared interests, but no shared values.” The terms of the arrangement have not changed: Washington offers Riyadh security protection in exchange for affordable oil for the world economy. Riedel, a former National Security Council staffer and CIA analyst, relies on unclassified sources to present a lucid account of an often troubled relationship. He makes clear that Saudi leaders have shared a sincere commitment to the Palestinian cause and a consistent desire to see Washington involved in seeking Arab-Israeli peace. Riedel echoes others who have depicted the Saudi monarchy as shocked by U.S. President Barack Obama’s abandonment of Egyptian ruler Hosni Mubarak during the uprising that rocked Egypt in 2011. But it is hard to believe that successive Saudi leaders had not closely followed the fates of a parade of fallen autocrats who had enjoyed American support—the shah of Iran, Suharto of Indonesia, Ferdinand Marcos of the Philippines, Augusto Pinochet of Chile, and others—and drawn the logical conclusion."
12,Egypt,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2018-02-13/egypt,Egypt,"Much ink has been spilled on “deep states.” Springborg takes readers inside one. Under President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, Egypt’s deep state is deeper and darker than ever before. In one of his more surprising claims, Springborg depicts the Egyptian state under King Farouk in the 1940s in relatively flattering terms and asserts that a succession of Egyptian autocrats have led the country down a path to politically vicious, economically unsustainable authoritarianism. Sisi has built on this dubious inheritance. Economic strategy has been sacrificed to prop up the intelligence services and to enrich the military, which controls much of the economy. Consumer subsidies, debt servicing, and civil-service wages take up 90 percent of the budget. The military lives off external and internal rents. Springborg examines how the presidency, the military, and the intelligence apparatus manipulate and control Parliament, the judiciary, and the bureaucracy. He then shows how the regime deals, in turn, with citizens (Muslims and Copts), labor, and students. He ends with a kind of Malthusian portrait of Egypt as living so far beyond its neglected means that it will surely fall off a cliff."

As with all high-profile assassinations, one asks, futilely, what might have been. Rabin had guided Israel through the Oslo Accords and a treaty with Jordan and had engaged in a long-distance dance with President Hafez al-Assad of Syria before concluding that Assad was not ready for peace. In this thorough book, Rabinovich, who served for a time as Rabin’s point person on Syria and as Israel’s ambassador to the United States, portrays Rabin as old school: a military man from 1941 on. He was harsh in his treatment of Palestinians during the war in 1948 and then again, 40 years later, during the first intifada. He pushed for the development of Israel’s nuclear arsenal. Yet he saw Israel’s security as inextricably linked to peace with all its neighbors. He was not in favor of giving up all of the West Bank, occupied by Israel in 1967, but he knew that hanging on to it would mean that Israel would remain forever a garrison state. Had he survived, Rabin would have been at loggerheads with Likudniks and neoconservatives in Washington, who have long wanted to separate the Palestinian issue from broader questions of regional security."
14,Hezbollah: The Political Economy of Lebanon’s Party of God,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2018-02-13/hezbollah-political-economy-lebanons-party-god,Hezbollah: The Political Economy of Lebanon’s Party of God,"What is original about Daher’s useful treatment of Hezbollah is his emphasis on the transformation of its base, which used to draw on the lower-middle class and the clergy but is now more closely aligned with a new Shiite capitalist class. As a result, Hezbollah is comfortable with Lebanon’s neoliberal economic policies. Daher explores the group’s changing relationship with organized labor and Lebanese civil society, the rising levels of corruption in the party, and the role of Hezbollah’s military apparatus in the Syrian civil war. Daher sees Hezbollah as an increasingly status quo force that uses its religious and military power to enhance its national and regional influence, rather than to merely confront Israel, which had been its traditional primary objective. There is one major lacuna in Daher’s narrative, however, which partly prevents him from clinching all his arguments: he makes no comprehensive analysis of Hezbollah’s finances, which depend on support from Iran; the Lebanese Shiite diaspora in the United States, Latin America, and West Africa; and the levying of a tithe on Shiites at home."

Social history eventually supplanted political history, but then gave way to history “across the divide,” which welds together the events that took place before and after the revolution. Hasegawa adopts the social-history approach and focuses on less studied elements of Russian society. Engelstein’s book, meanwhile, is very much an example of the “across the divide” approach."

Shore’s book is written at the deepest human level and is built on the testimony of those who participated in the 2014 revolution that rocked Ukraine or who experienced firsthand the war in the eastern part of the country known as the Donbas, which broke out in the aftermath of the revolution. In the first half of the book, Shore shares the vivid accounts of those who took part in the Maidan uprising and their reflections on how the drama redefined their lives and the bleak realities of Ukraine. The second half records the simple but searing thoughts and impulses of those who fought or were caught up in the war. Most of them were on the Ukrainian side; those who came from the pro-Russian separatist regions provide homely but telling insights into what the war meant to them and the people among whom they grew up. Literature offers added resonance: for Shore, echoes from novels and short stories run through the tales she hears; for some of those who lived through these events, poetry was a sustaining force."

She comes down squarely on the side of the more sinister explanation. The book is a detailed examination of the most dramatic cases, beginning with the 1998 murder of Galina Starovoitova, a charismatic liberal politician, and including a multitude of others, among them the killings of the former intelligence officer Alexander Litvinenko and the opposition politician Boris Nemtsov. In each case, she details the events leading up to the murder, lays out the evidence, and describes the subsequent arrests and trials. And in each case, neither Knight nor those close to the victim are satisfied with the verdict. As she recognizes, the evidence, with the partial exception of the Litvinenko case, is largely circumstantial. But the book’s value is that Knight supplies enough of it for readers to decide for themselves."

At the center stands the author’s grandfather, Max, a taciturn, somewhat mysterious man, who was a key organizer for the turn-of-the-century Russian Bund, a Jewish Marxist movement. Hunted by the tsar’s police and twice exiled to Siberia, he later became a dapper marketing representative for the London-based Yost Typewriter Company. His wife, Frouma, had fled revolutionary Russia for the United Kingdom, but most of her family had remained, suffered, and survived. Mazower’s father, William, grew up thoroughly English, a middle-class secular Jew in Depression-era and wartime England. His half brother, André, in an ironic contrast, joined the extreme right and wrote anti-Semitic tracts. Mazower engagingly weaves together these lives and traces how they crossed paths with Felix Dzerzhinsky, the founder of the Soviet secret police; Maxim Litvinov, Stalin’s foreign minister; the poet T. S. Eliot; the anarchist Emma Goldman; and a host of other prominent interwar political and literary figures."
19,Hunter of Stories,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2018-02-13/hunter-stories,Hunter of Stories,"Galeano (1940–2015) exemplified the literary left that held sway in Latin America from the 1960s through the 1980s. Sales of the Uruguayan’s most famous polemic, Open Veins of Latin America, spiked in 2009, when Hugo Chávez, the populist strongman president of Venezuela, handed a copy to U.S. President Barack Obama at a summit meeting. Hunter of Stories collects bite-sized anecdotes and narratives, generally just a few paragraphs long, many with ironic intent. They often revisit the central theme of Galeano’s work: the majesty and wisdom of the indigenous people of the Americas juxtaposed against the grave injustices imposed on the oppressed masses by the most powerful, be they Spanish conquistadors, military dictators, hypocritical “democrats,” large U.S. corporations, or the International Monetary Fund. Galeano, a self-proclaimed eternal optimist, had a passion for giving voice to the weak and illiterate and for recording the heroism of the vanquished: “the eternal battle of indignation against indignity,” he called it. Galeano was also a close observer of the marvels and rhythms of the natural world. Contemplating his own sickness and old age, this passionate rebel and storyteller once viewed an astonishing sunset and lamented: “It would be so unfair to die and see it no longer.”"

Prior to the country’s 1959 revolution, Cuban chefs produced a rich cuisine. Once in power, however, the revolutionary leader Fidel Castro closed private restaurants, and government canteens took on a Soviet-style blandness. Even worse, the end of Soviet subsidies in the 1990s resulted in severe food scarcities, and many Cubans suffered significant weight loss. In recent years, however, with Cuba under the more relaxed rule of Raúl Castro, private restaurants (paladares) are reemerging, and the country is experiencing a rebirth of its culinary culture. Von Bremzen and Schlow introduce readers to the brave owners and innovative chefs who run these new business ventures, who struggle to locate essential ingredients and avoid the glare of government inspectors. Von Bremzen’s well-researched backgrounders on the many mouthwatering, simple recipes—illustrated by Schlow’s handsome photographs—provide an education in culinary history. The new Cuban cuisine, like the island’s political economy, is very much a work in progress. But Paladares reveals the spirit and promise of a vibrant nation, brimming with entrepreneurial improvisation and artistic creativity, striving to rejoin global currents."

In his highly intelligent and richly detailed memoir, the wily, sharp-tongued diplomat seeks to justify his controversial and ill-fated attempt to insert Brazil into negotiations over Iran’s nuclear program and to explain his more sure-footed and well-informed but equally unsuccessful effort to secure a deal during the World Trade Organization’s failed Doha Round of trade negotiations. He blames others for both outcomes: France, Russia, and the United States foiled his Iranian gambit, and protectionist nations (particularly India and the United States) impeded the trade accord. Amorim sought to establish Brazil as a trusted, balanced interlocutor and as a prestigious player on the world stage. Yet in his caustic asides, Amorim reveals his own skewed sensibilities, his sensitivity to perceived slights, and his obvious receptivity to personal flattery—all of which help explain why his efforts often came up short. Lula’s Brazil sought to punch above its weight. The more recent near collapse of the country’s political system and economy has at least momentarily returned Brazil to mere middle-power status."

Collins, a former priest, never advances the hyperbolic claim in this book’s subtitle. His more modest aim is instead to show how popes have consolidated their hold within the Catholic Church itself since the turn of the nineteenth century. In the process, he argues, the papacy has suppressed reformist elements, local parishes, and women everywhere. Yet this blinkered vision of the church treats papal power as resulting entirely from infallible theological pronouncements and the bureaucratic influence of the Roman Curia, the Vatican’s administrative body. The reader gets little sense of even the most obvious social and cultural trends that surround and shape any religion. Such developments have transformed modern Catholicism beyond recognition. The declining number of active Catholics in Europe and North America, for example, has left more developing-world believers, who tend to be more conservative, in control. South America is now home to more Catholics than any other continent, and Catholicism is growing most rapidly in sub-Saharan Africa. For a full understanding of the church’s role in the world, readers should look elsewhere."

Toklas, and four other mid-twentieth-century culinary writers who introduced Americans to fine French cooking. The book’s aim is neither to illuminate French culinary culture nor to explain why so many Americans were receptive to it in the postwar era. It is rather to examine the six authors’ individual foibles and the idiosyncratic ways in which they led each one to become a gastronomic guru. In doing so, the book serves heaping portions of snarky gossip, sharp criticism, and insight into the commercial side of cookbooks and cuisine. Obsessively detailed, the book spares no one, and its vivid prose keeps the reader going through a seemingly inexhaustible catalog of moneygrubbing schemes, lovers’ spats, and personal weaknesses. Intermittently visible behind the biographical pastiche lies the uniquely romantic atmosphere of Paris, the city that attracted all the main characters with its unique mix of deeply rooted cultural traditions, tolerance of bohemian lifestyles, and class snobbery. For those who enjoy long afternoons with friends in a good café, dishing dirt on the rich or famous, this book is a must-read."
24,European Civil Service in (Times of) Crisis: A Political Sociology of the Changing Power of Eurocrats,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2018-02-13/european-civil-service-times-crisis-political-sociology-changing,European Civil Service in (Times of) Crisis: A Political Sociology of the Changing Power of Eurocrats,"Many believe that the civil servants who manage the EU—labeled “Eurocrats” by critics—are too numerous, unaccountable, powerful, and pampered. In this book, Georgakakis debunks that myth. The population of Eurocrats (around 40,000) is no larger than the number of public servants typically employed by a major European city—and thus only five percent of the average per capita number of public employees in the EU member states. In recent years, moreover, civil-service reforms have much diminished the power and perks that Eurocrats enjoy. Ironically, the British government led the effort to impose a distinctively Anglo-Saxon bureaucratic model on Eurocrats, only to suffer criticism from Brexiteers who view the Brussels bureaucracy as a foreign imposition. More broadly, the influence of the most independent part of the EU, the European Commission, has waned relative to that of national governments, technocratic bodies, and the elected European Parliament. No wonder Eurocrats today are less idealistic than they used to be: fewer now believe that they are spearheading a grand, open-ended experiment in supranational governance. Despite its academic verbosity and occasionally awkward prose, this book details an important and overlooked transformation in how contemporary Europe is governed."
25,Dilemmas of Inclusion: Muslims in European Politics,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2018-02-13/dilemmas-inclusion-muslims-european-politics,Dilemmas of Inclusion: Muslims in European Politics,"The participation of Muslims in European politics has spawned a heated debate often dominated by anti-immigrant prophets of doom. Dancygier sheds a cooling light on the issue. With a sophisticated analysis of thousands of elections in Austria, Belgium, Germany, and the United Kingdom, she shows that European political parties have been ruthlessly pragmatic in attracting Muslim votes. As soon as a pool of Muslim voters reaches a significant size, parties select candidates who can best appeal to them. Yet this poses difficult political dilemmas. The easiest Muslims for a party to attract, and those who will offer the most electoral advantage, tend to be those who are geographically concentrated—and thus also the least assimilated and most conservative. Often, the traditional bases of European parties hold different views on gender, religion, and sexuality than the typical Muslim in such enclaves. So tailoring messages to new Muslim voters can fragment parties and ultimately undermine their electoral success. Meanwhile, such tactics tend to degrade solidarity in society as a whole—blocking inclusion, fostering anti-Muslim sentiment, empowering conservative religious leaders, and undermining the influence of Muslim women. In the long term, the best way to resolve these dilemmas may be to dilute ethnic enclaves and challenge traditional social structures."
26,"Go, Went, Gone",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2018-02-13/go-went-gone,"Go, Went, Gone","This brilliantly understated novel traces with uncommon delicacy and depth the interior transformation of a retired German classicist named Richard. One day, he stumbles upon a group of unauthorized African migrants encamped in the center of Berlin. First, he sees only the immediate life-and-death challenges they face. As many Germans have done recently, he helps mobilize churches, organizations, and individuals to assist them. Most of the refugees disappear anyway. But Richard gets to know the ones that remain. He witnesses their struggle to retain vivid memories of lost families, loves, communities, and cultures—without which they find it difficult to maintain their dignity. In the end, Richard comes to realize that his life, too, is lived on “the surface of the sea,” beneath which lie many things “one cannot possibly endure.” He, too, must cope with troubling traumas and decide which memories to foster and which to repress. Erpenbeck possesses an uncanny ability to portray the mundane interactions and routines that compose everyday life, which she elevates into an intimately moving meditation on one of the great issues of our times. Her economical prose lends existential significance to the most commonplace conversations, defined less by what they include than by what they omit."
27,The Ghosts of Langley: Into the CIA’s Heart of Darkness,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2018-02-13/ghosts-langley-cias-heart-darkness,The Ghosts of Langley: Into the CIA’s Heart of Darkness,"There are few government agencies as controversial as the CIA, and few researchers have brought as much passion and determination to understanding it as Prados. His story begins with the Office of Strategic Services (the precursor to the CIA, established during World War II), continues through the disastrous CIA-backed Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba, and gains energy and detail when it arrives at the Iran-contra scandal of the Reagan years and the George W. Bush administration’s use of “enhanced interrogation techniques” after the 9/11 attacks. Prados’ research and unrelenting search for the truth are admirable, and his conclusions command respect, if not always assent. He highlights serious problems at the agency but says very little about any successes it has enjoyed. The secrecy and isolation of the CIA can lead to excessive suspicion among outsiders; it can also lead to a hothouse environment inside the agency, in which flawed planning can lead to serious mistakes. The Ghosts of Langley is not the last word on the CIA, but it contains information and perspectives that those concerned for the future of this important institution would do well to consider."

In this book on the politics of the Iran nuclear deal, Jett takes an interesting, if imperfect, look at the domestic actors that sought to influence U.S. policy before and after the international negotiations that led to the deal. Jett, whose belief that no truly rational argument can be made against the agreement shines forth on every page, gets at least one important thing right: although some of the most prominent individuals and organizations that opposed the deal were Jewish, the U.S. Jewish community was deeply divided over Iran policy, with most Jewish Americans siding with President Barack Obama and supporting the agreement. That said, Jett’s inability to grasp the salience of the procedural and policy arguments that opponents of the deal brought forward leads to a somewhat one-sided account of a complex debate. At its weakest, the book reads like a collection of talking points; at its best, it helps readers understand the complicated links between domestic politics and foreign policy that presidents and diplomats neglect at their peril."

When questions of race, economic inequality, and the rise of giant corporate monopolies and a plutocratic elite dominate U.S. politics, it is time to take another look at Reconstruction and the Gilded Age, the period of American history stretching, roughly, from the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln in 1865 to William McKinley’s election as president in 1896. This was a frustrating time. The Civil War did not end with the triumph of democracy and racial brotherhood but rather in an ugly and ultimately losing fight against the forces of white supremacy. The Industrial Revolution left Americans divided by class; meanwhile, mass immigration led to ethnic polarization. It was a time when U.S. institutions and ideologies were unable to cope with the problems the country faced and when populist movements surged as governments failed to meet public needs. The rich history of those years can be difficult to follow; readers will thank White for the clear prose and strong narrative drive that makes this complicated story easier to understand."
30,National Security Strategy of the United States of America,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2018-02-13/national-security-strategy-united-states-america,National Security Strategy of the United States of America,"The 2017 U.S. National Security Strategy attempts to integrate President Donald Trump’s aversion to trade agreements with his emphasis on American sovereignty at the expense of multilateral institutions and his skepticism about the prospects for democratization in the developing world with a policy of U.S. global engagement. The authors articulate a Jacksonian view of world order, in which a sovereign United States, secure in its military, technological, and economic power, frustrates revisionist great powers, maintains a global alliance system, and actively counters terrorism and other threats to the homeland. The keys to this strategy are domestic: reviving the economy through tax cuts and deregulation and promoting U.S. energy production. U.S. military spending will increase. China, as the most important economic and security competitor to the United States, will be the central concern of American strategy. There are many reasons to be skeptical that this approach can succeed—or that Trump will prove disciplined enough to follow it. But the political pressures to which it responds are real and won’t go away anytime soon. The post–Cold War foreign policy era is over, and as U.S. policymakers think about what comes next, they will find that the domestic political dynamics that helped shape this strategy statement will remain relevant even when the Trump administration comes to an end."

The conventional wisdom holds that Abrams developed a more credible strategy that was showing results, until it was undermined by Congress, which failed to back the military, and the press, which stoked public opposition to the war. In his latest book, Daddis is having none of this. He argues that the changes Abrams made were less significant than many assumed, and he shows that the narrative of military victory snatched away by Congress and antiwar sentiment misses a vital point. The real problem had less to do with U.S. military strategy than with the South Vietnamese government’s failure to develop an authentic national identity that could sustain it through the next stage of what had already been a long civil war."

Kello situates himself closer to the first group and argues that the emergence of cyberweapons in the twenty-first century has been as revolutionary in its implications as the introduction of nuclear weapons was in the twentieth. Atomic arsenals threatened unprecedented mass destruction, but they mostly fit within traditional models of interstate war. Cyberweapons, on the other hand, do not kill directly but can interfere with systems that do, and they empower nonstate actors as much as states. Using familiar examples—the Stuxnet virus, which the United States and Israel directed against Iranian nuclear enrichment facilities; North Korea’s hacking of Sony Pictures; the Russian cyberattack on Estonia in 2007; and Russian interference in the U.S. presidential election in 2016—Kello addresses the danger of escalation, the prospects for cyberdefense and cyberdeterrence, and the problem of crafting legal remedies for malevolent behavior."

In reality, the book is an enthralling, gossipy account of the interplay between senior U.S. military and political leaders since the end of the Cold War. The events covered in the book are already well known (the U.S.-led wars in the Balkans, Afghanistan, and Iraq), as are the personalities, including generals such as Wesley Clark, Tommy Franks, David Petraeus, and Colin Powell. What Perry adds are accounts of personal rivalries and interservice competition and details about how Presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama looked to the generals to get the advice they wanted—which was not always the advice they really needed. Clinton’s first term opened with a public spat with Powell over whether gay people should be allowed to serve in the military, yet when it came to the wisdom of a war with Iraq a decade later, senior officers kept their misgivings to themselves. The book demonstrates that far from forming a cabal against the White House, U.S. military leaders have often failed to challenge civilian leaders who were making poor decisions."

This candid and chilling memoir describes how he came to recognize that the U.S. military’s approach to preparing for nuclear war was terrifyingly casual. If war came, the United States was ready to obliterate not only the Soviet Union but also China, as a matter of course—a plan that would have immediately produced 275 million fatalities and then led to another 50 million, owing to the effects of radiation. And those numbers do not even include the lives that would have been lost by the United States and its allies. Ellsberg was appalled, but he understood the logic of deterrence and the policy challenges that had allowed such an approach to develop. This gives his account credibility and poignancy: at one point, he drafts an alternative war plan that would still have horrific consequences—just not as awful as the one it would replace. His experiences have led Ellsberg to argue that however much he might like to see nuclear weapons abolished, the first step in addressing the danger must be to make them harder to use."

It tells the stories of companies (mostly private but also some state-owned enterprises), offers sociological portraits of factory workers, and considers the portrayal of factories in art, literature, and films. The earliest large factories were established in England in the 1720s, produced silk yarn, and employed around 300 people. By 1945, Ford’s River Rouge facility in Dearborn, Michigan, employed 85,000 people, who mainly worked on building bombers. Today, some factory complexes in China employ over 100,000 workers. Building factories on a large scale has sometimes involved erecting whole cities for their employees, which has introduced a myriad of logistical problems; this was often the case in the Soviet Union. In their heyday, big factories signaled and celebrated the arrival of a modern technological age and new opportunities for laborers. Later, they facilitated the organization of dissatisfied workers. In recent decades, factories have declined in size in Europe and the United States, not least because large and densely concentrated facilities increase the risk of disruption to value chains owing to human events or natural phenomena such as earthquakes and storms."
36,Vaccines: What Everyone Needs to Know,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2018-02-13/vaccines-what-everyone-needs-know,Vaccines: What Everyone Needs to Know,"Life has been made immeasurably better by the sharp decline in the incidence of infectious diseases, an improvement made possible through inoculations, especially of children, which protect people from contracting diseases and have led to the elimination or near elimination of maladies such as smallpox and polio. Yet public wariness of vaccines persists and has even in some cases increased—perhaps, ironically, owing in part to the decline in disease incidence produced by vaccines. This useful, fair-minded, and extremely informative book explains how vaccines are produced and how they work; discusses the diverse reasons behind some parents’ hesitancy to inoculate their children; explores the prospect of employing vaccines for not only preventing but also curing some diseases, including AIDS and even some cancers; and examines the potential for the total elimination of particular diseases, such as measles."

The year 2008 was arguably the worst financial year since 1931—which was a very bad year indeed. This important book distinguishes itself by focusing on how central banks—specifically, the U.S. Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank, the Bank of England, and the Bank of Japan—took unconventional actions to avert another Great Depression. Ubide, an economist with extensive practical experience in wealth management, discusses misconceptions about the role of monetary and fiscal policies in contributing to and helping end the crisis; he argues that extremely low (even negative) interest rates, vast central bank purchases of bonds, and “forward guidance”—statements that central banks make to inform the public of likely future decisions—made sense to stimulate economic recovery in the wake of the crisis. Such steps, which were once unconventional, and are now more common, may become quite normal in future. This is something of a niche subject, but Ubide’s presentation of these ideas does not rely on overly technical language."
38,Capitalism Without Capital: The Rise of the Intangible Economy,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2018-02-13/capitalism-without-capital-rise-intangible-economy,Capitalism Without Capital: The Rise of the Intangible Economy,"In the context of business spending, “investment” is a word with diverse meanings, which often leads to confusion. Economists usually use it to refer to expenditures on tangible things, such as buildings and equipment—a kind of spending that raises future earnings. The authors of this informative book, by contrast, define it more broadly as expenditure today in the expectation of material rewards in the future. Haskel and Westlake note that in all rich countries, “intangible investment”—spending on things such as research and development and branding—has been growing relative to tangible investment. The data are often sketchy, but the authors report that intangible investment now exceeds the tangible kind in Finland and Sweden, and does so by even larger margins in the United Kingdom and the United States. The authors explore how the changing nature of investment will affect companies, investment analysts, economists, and governments, and they offer suggestions for all. This is a useful exposition of a number of widely used but poorly understood terms and concepts."

This intriguing book opens and closes with a spirited dialogue between a young woman skeptical of capitalism and her father, Corneo, an economist who is keeping the faith, albeit not without reservations. Corneo takes seriously the many criticisms of capitalism as it is practiced today but insists that detractors must confront the question of which alternative systems could realistically meet contemporary society’s economic needs. In this sweeping and informative discussion of the role of economy in society, he explores alternative systems, both hypothetical and real, and finds them all inferior to capitalism. The book then addresses how the modern welfare state has tempered capitalism’s worst features but has eroded since the late twentieth century—a development that is responsible for much of today’s public disillusionment with the free-market system. Corneo considers how the welfare state might be revived under current conditions, which would require new incentives for politicians and civil servants to construct a sturdier safety net."
40,Future Fights,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/review-essay/2018-02-13/future-fights,Future Fights,"Former U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates has been known to quip that Washington’s predictions about its future wars have been one hundred percent right, zero percent of the time. In early 1950, officials said that the United States would not fight in Korea. In 1964, U.S. President Lyndon Johnson promised that he would not send American troops to fight wars in Asia. Iraq was not on any American’s list of enemies in 1990; after all, the United States had assisted that country in its war against Iran just a decade before. And few people—not even Khalid Sheik Mohammed, one of the architects of the 9/11 attacks—anticipated the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan in 2001."
41,Beyond Gridlock,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2018-02-13/beyond-gridlock,Beyond Gridlock,"Conventional wisdom holds that the Western-centered postwar system of multilateral cooperation is in crisis. In areas as diverse as security, trade, development, the environment, and public health, the challenges of managing interdependence have multiplied and cooperation has receded. In an earlier book, Hale and Held described the problem as “gridlock”: a world order marked by dysfunctional international institutions and countries less willing or able to coordinate polices and provide global public goods. In this new book, the authors reassess that bleak outlook. Reporting on research conducted by a consortium of experts, the book identifies some areas of effective cooperation, such as the World Trade Organization’s dispute-settlement mechanism and the Chemical Weapons Convention. It also notes that, as older frameworks weaken, new types of multilateral cooperation have emerged. For example, although the WTO’s Doha Round of trade talks has stalled, China is building trade and investment ties across Central Asia and Southeast Asia. The Paris agreement on climate change signaled another form of progress. As Hale and Held see it, the institutions of global governance are inadequate, but small innovations and experiments in cooperation—often pursued regionally, in coalition with civil society groups, or by transnational technical elites—show promise."
42,How to Do Things With International Law,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2018-02-13/how-do-things-international-law,How to Do Things With International Law,"Scholars and policymakers have traditionally seen international law as a framework designed to tame state power. In this insightful book, Hurd argues that international law is actually best understood as a tool of state power—less an externally imposed constraint than a resource that governments employ to authorize and legitimize what they want to do. He arrives at this contrarian view by closely examining the role of international law in contemporary disputes over war, torture, and drones. In Hurd’s portrait, governments pragmatically—and sometimes cynically—interpret international law to suit their purposes. They look for legal arguments that will justify their actions and create a “vocabulary of virtue” to describe their policies. Governments have steadily expanded what qualifies as self-defense, for example, in order to give themselves permission to use force. Nevertheless, Hurd notes, in often small and subtle ways, international law also constructively shapes how states think about and pursue their interests."
43,The Sovereignty Wars: Reconciling America With the World,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2018-02-13/sovereignty-wars-reconciling-america-world,The Sovereignty Wars: Reconciling America With the World,"For more than a century, the grand debate over the United States’ global role has tended to pivot on one question: Can Washington best advance its interests and values through international institutions or through its own national efforts and ad hoc partnerships? At times, as Patrick illuminates in this cogent and timely book, this debate has turned into “sovereignty wars,” heated controversies over whether the United States should accept constraints on its autonomy and freedom of action. The U.S. Senate’s debate over President Woodrow Wilson’s League of Nations was the first and most dramatic fight of this kind. But more recent arguments over the North American Free Trade Agreement, the International Criminal Court, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and the Paris agreement on climate change have proved almost as profound and consequential. Cutting through the hyperbole and inflamed rhetoric that tends to surround this subject, Patrick argues that when the United States signs a treaty or ties itself to other countries, it is exercising its sovereign authority, not abdicating it. Washington’s long-term efforts to build and operate within a world of rules and institutions have made it easier, not harder, for the United States to be the captain of its own future."
44,Safe Passage: The Transition From British to American Hegemony,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2018-02-13/safe-passage-transition-british-american-hegemony,Safe Passage: The Transition From British to American Hegemony,"World power transitions are rare but perilous moments when hegemonic leadership passes hands. From the ancient struggles between Athens and Sparta to the world wars of the twentieth century, these grand shifts have often been bloody. The passage of leadership from the United Kingdom to the United States, however, stands out as unusually peaceful. Although this story has been told many times, Schake provides a fresh and insightful account that focuses on key moments when American and British elites revised their judgments about each other and their changing geopolitical fortunes. She argues that the transition was peaceful mostly because it unfolded slowly over a century, during which the United States became an empire and the United Kingdom became a democracy. A shared political heritage and common liberal democratic values helped an increasingly beleaguered United Kingdom decide that it could cede leadership to the United States and harness U.S. power to the pursuit of its own interests. The book is most fascinating in its details, illuminating the myriad struggles between London and Washington over the rules and institutions that would form the basis for Pax Americana."
45,How Democracies Die,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2018-02-13/how-democracies-die,How Democracies Die,"Since the mid-twentieth century, most people in Europe and North America have taken for granted the stability of their liberal democratic institutions. In the postwar decades, some democracies did collapse, but they tended to be weak states in poor countries outside the  advanced Western world, such as Argentina, Brazil, Ghana, Peru, and Thailand. Today, as Levitsky and Ziblatt argue in this important study, democracies are dying in slower and more subtle ways—and Western democracies, including the United States, are not immune. The risk comes not from power-hungry generals or revolutionary parties but from elected officials who come to office—often riding a nationalist, populist, anti-elite, anticorruption wave—and proceed to take small steps toward authoritarianism. The threat is so dangerous precisely because each step is often legal. Delivering a powerful wake-up call, Levitsky and Ziblatt see signs of erosion in “the soft guardrails” of democracy in the United States. Decades of extreme polarization have taken their toll on the respect for constitutional checks and balances and on traditional American political norms, such as mutual toleration, acceptance of the legitimacy of rivals, and self-restraint in the use of institutional prerogatives."

Despite plenty of evidence to the contrary, Trump kept repeating his nonsense. To this day, polls show that some 70 percent of registered Republicans doubt Obama’s citizenship.

It redrew the map, enriched Europe, and left millions of Africans and Asians dead. For example, in 1870, some 80 percent of Africa south of the Sahara was under the control of indigenous kings, chiefs, or other such rulers. Within 35 years, virtually the entire continent, only a few patches excepted, was made up of European colonies or protectorates. France, Germany, Italy, Portugal, Spain, and the United Kingdom had all seized pieces of “this magnificent African cake,” in the words of King Leopold II of Belgium—who took an enormous slice for himself."
48,The Clash of Exceptionalisms,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/united-states/clash-exceptionalisms,The Clash of Exceptionalisms,"Many Americans have recoiled at President Donald Trump’s “America first” foreign policy. Critics charge that his populist brand of statecraft undermines the United States’ role as an exceptional nation destined to bring political and economic liberty to a waiting world. Trump exhibits isolationist, unilateralist, and protectionist instincts; indifference to the promotion of democracy; and animosity toward immigrants. How could Americans elect a president so at odds with what their country stands for?"

The gun which produces the vote should remain its security officer—its guarantor. The people’s votes and the people’s guns are always inseparable twins.”"

Although Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, the Republican chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, insisted that the hearing was “not specific to anybody,” Democrats used the opportunity to air concerns that President Donald Trump might stumble into nuclear war. After all, he had threatened to unleash “fire and fury” on North Korea, and he subsequently boasted in a tweet about the size of the figurative “nuclear button” on his desk in the Oval Office. General C. Robert Kehler—a former head of U.S. Strategic Command, the main organization responsible for fighting a nuclear war—tried to calm senators’ fears about an irresponsible president starting such a war on a whim. He described how the existing process for authorizing the launch of nuclear weapons would “enable the president to consult with his senior advisers” and reminded the senators that officers in the chain of command are duty-bound to refuse an illegal order."

Once solid autocracies have fallen by the wayside, their state institutions battered and broken, and their national borders compromised. Syria and Yemen have descended into bloody civil wars worsened by foreign military interventions. A terrorist group, the Islamic State (also known as ISIS), seized vast areas of Iraq and Syria before being pushed back by an international coalition led by the United States."
52,How to Crack Down on Tax Havens,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/bermuda/2018-02-13/how-crack-down-tax-havens,How to Crack Down on Tax Havens,"On October 17, 2008, during the throes of the global financial crisis, officials from the U.S. Department of Justice summoned Swiss banking regulators and executives from UBS, Switzerland’s largest bank, to a closed-door meeting in New York to discuss the bank’s role in helping American clients evade taxes. It was a sensitive moment: the Swiss government had bailed out UBS the previous day. The bank’s game plan was simple, a company insider later told Reuters: “Admit guilt, settle the case quickly, and move on.”"
53,Green Giant,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2018-02-13/green-giant,Green Giant,"In 1997, in need of increasing oil and gas imports to fuel its accerating economy, China launched a new energy policy. Intent on replicating Washington’s close relationships with large oil-producing countries, its diplomats toured oil-state capitals, offering investment and arms in exchange for guaranteed supplies. Of particular interest were governments that had been ostracized by Western powers—an opening, Beijing believed, that would allow it to level the energy playing field with the United States and have the added benefit of fueling conflicts that would distract the U.S. military just as it was trying to refocus on Asia."
54,Life in China’s Asia,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2018-02-13/life-chinas-asia,Life in China’s Asia,"For now, the United States remains the dominant power in East Asia, but China is quickly closing the gap. Although an economic crisis or domestic political turmoil could derail China’s rise, if current trends continue, China will before long supplant the United States as the region’s economic, military, and political hegemon."
55,The China Reckoning,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2018-02-13/china-reckoning,The China Reckoning,"The United States has always had an outsize sense of its ability to determine China’s course. Again and again, its ambitions have come up short. After World War II, George Marshall, the U.S. special envoy to China, hoped to broker a peace between the Nationalists and Communists in the Chinese Civil War. During the Korean War, the Truman administration thought it could dissuade Mao Zedong’s troops from crossing the Yalu River. The Johnson administration believed Beijing would ultimately circumscribe its involvement in Vietnam. In each instance, Chinese realities upset American expectations."
56,Just and Unjust Leaks,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/world/just-and-unjust-leaks,Just and Unjust Leaks,"All governments, all political parties, and all politicians keep secrets and tell lies. Some lie more than others, and those differences are important, but the practice is general. And some lies and secrets may be justified, whereas others may not. Citizens, therefore, need to know the difference between just and unjust secrets and between just and unjust deception before they can decide when it may be justifiable for someone to reveal the secrets or expose the lies—when leaking confidential information, releasing classified documents, or blowing the whistle on misconduct may be in the public interest or, better, in the interest of democratic government."
57,Giving Up the High Ground,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2018-02-13/giving-high-ground,Giving Up the High Ground,"No U.S. president has spoken about human rights the way Donald Trump has. During the campaign, he praised Saddam Hussein for his approach to counterterrorism in Iraq: “He killed terrorists. He did that so good. They didn’t read them the rights. They didn’t talk. They were a terrorist. It was over.” He promised to loosen the restrictions on interrogating terrorism suspects: “I would bring back a hell of a lot worse than waterboarding.” He went out of his way to compliment Russian President Vladimir Putin’s abusive rule: “In terms of leadership, he is getting an A.” And in a television interview shortly after his inauguration, when asked why he respected Putin—“a killer,” in the interviewer’s words—Trump responded, “We’ve got a lot of killers. What, do you think our country’s so innocent?”"
58,The Post-American World Economy,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/united-states/post-american-world-economy,The Post-American World Economy,"In the aftermath of World War II, the United States set about building a global, rules-based economic order. At the heart of that order, it put the liberal values of free trade and the rule of law. Over the next seven decades, the order, backed by U.S. power and bolstered by its growing legitimacy among other countries, prevented most economic disputes from escalating into mutually destructive trade wars, let alone military conflict. That allowed even the smallest and poorest countries to develop their social and economic potential without having to worry about predation by stronger neighbors. By taking much of the fear out of the global economy, the U.S.-led order allowed market decisions to be driven by business, not bullying."
59,The Rise of Illiberal Hegemony,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/united-states/rise-illiberal-hegemony,The Rise of Illiberal Hegemony,"On the campaign trail, Donald Trump vowed to put an end to nation building abroad and mocked U.S. allies as free riders. “‘America first’ will be the major and overriding theme of my administration,” he declared in a foreign policy speech in April 2016, echoing the language of pre–World War II isolationists. “The countries we are defending must pay for the cost of this defense, and if not, the U.S. must be prepared to let these countries defend themselves,” he said—an apparent reference to his earlier suggestion that U.S. allies without nuclear weapons be allowed to acquire them."
60,The World After Trump,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2018-03-05/world-after-trump,The World After Trump,"The warnings started long before Donald Trump was even a presidential candidate. For at least a decade, a growing chorus of foreign policy experts had been pointing to signs that the international order was coming apart. Authoritarian powers were flouting long-accepted rules. Failed states were radiating threats. Economies were being disrupted by technology and globalization; political systems, by populism. Meanwhile, the gap in power and influence between the United States—the leader and guarantor of the existing order—and the rest of the world was closing."
61,Trump’s Lucky Year,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2018-01-20/trumps-lucky-year,Trump’s Lucky Year,"When Donald Trump became president of the United States, many wondered just how abnormal his administration, and particularly his foreign policy, would be. After all, as a candidate, Trump had evinced a partiality for foreign strongmen, derided U.S. allies as a gang of freeloaders, proposed banning Muslims from entering the United States, sneered at Mexicans, and denounced free-trade agreements such as the North American Free Trade Agreement and the nascent Trans-Pacific Partnership, while demonstrating little understanding of most other dimensions of international politics. Scores of former senior Republican foreign policy officials, myself included, repudiated his candidacy on the grounds of both his character and his bent toward populist isolationism. His inaugural address confirmed fears that he viewed the world in darkly narrow, zero-sum terms. “We’ve made other countries rich while the wealth, strength, and confidence of our country has dissipated over the horizon,” he said. He went on: “From this day forward, it’s going to be only America first. America first.”"

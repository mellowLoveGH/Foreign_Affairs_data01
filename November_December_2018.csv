0,Tailspin: The People and Forces Behind America’s Fifty-Year Fall—and Those Fighting to Reverse It,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2018-10-16/tailspin-people-and-forces-behind-americas-fifty-year-fall-and,Tailspin: The People and Forces Behind America’s Fifty-Year Fall—and Those Fighting to Reverse It,"Brill blends journalism and history to tell a complex but vital story: how the stable world of postwar U.S. capitalism transformed into the volatile and often ruthless economic system of today. There is no single culprit in Brill’s account. He shows how a series of apparently unrelated developments in law, finance, corporate management, and campaign funding combined to cause a dramatic decline in the fairness, decency, and prosperity of the United States. Perhaps the most interesting theme is how often liberal reforms led to massive, unforeseen problems later on. Brill blames the catastrophic fall in U.S. social mobility, for example, on the shift to meritocratic college admissions policies in the 1960s. The Supreme Court’s Citizens United decision, which opened the floodgates to corporate money in politics, began with a lawsuit filed by the Green Party presidential candidate Ralph Nader. Brill offers a rare thing: an intelligible summary of the political and policy changes that transformed American life in the last 50 years. But one is left wondering why, as Brill describes the havoc wreaked by the unforeseen consequences of one liberal reform after another, he is so confident that one more round of liberal reforms will set the country right."
1,African Actors in International Security: Shaping Contemporary Norms,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2018-10-16/african-actors-international-security-shaping-contemporary-norms,African Actors in International Security: Shaping Contemporary Norms,"This collection of essays argues that most commentators underestimate the extent to which Africans help shape contemporary norms about international peace and security. Based on a number of excellent case studies, the contributors make a strong case that African publics, governments, and intergovernmental organizations have played key roles in the development of norms regarding conict diamonds, humanitarian interventions, peace negotiations, and the trade in small arms. The essays identify several areas in which distinctively African norms have emerged, such as the reliance on retired African heads of state to mediate between dierent sides in a conflict."
2,Epidemic: Ebola and the Global Scramble to Prevent the Next Killer Outbreak,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2018-10-16/epidemic-ebola-and-global-scramble-prevent-next-killer-outbreak,Epidemic: Ebola and the Global Scramble to Prevent the Next Killer Outbreak,"The 2013 Ebola outbreak in West Africa killed at least 11,000 people, mostly in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. As this excellent book shows, the international health community was woefully unprepared to address the epidemic. West Africa suered from weak healthcare infrastructure, particularly in the three worst-hit countries, which had each recently been ravaged by civil war or political turmoil. In some cases, individual acts of heroism by health-care workers, some of whom lost their lives, mitigated the institutional weakness. But as the epidemic widened and panic spread around the globe, the World Health Organization, which was designed to lead the international response to such a catastrophe, proved dysfunctional. Much of the action in Wilson’s book takes place in the United States, where the Obama administration led the effort to better understand and contain the epidemic. He also shows how nongovernmental organizations, such as Doctors Without Borders, played key roles on the ground in West Africa. Wilson offers many lessons to help everyone involved prepare for the inevitable next outbreak."
3,"The Politics of Deforestation in Africa: Madagascar, Tanzania, and Uganda",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2018-10-16/politics-deforestation-africa-madagascar-tanzania-and-uganda,"The Politics of Deforestation in Africa: Madagascar, Tanzania, and Uganda","In recent years, officials have lavished much attention on Africa’s forests and launched many expensive programs meant to preserve them. But the pace of deforestation on the continent does not appear to have slowed. To explain why, Horning relies on careful eldwork in Madagascar, Tanzania, and Uganda. She argues that donor programs often garner only rhetorical support from local communities, which are usually driven by their own economic interests and the cultural and religious meanings they attach to the forests but find it convenient to keep the donations flowing. At the local level, moreover, people have their own material and political concerns and may not buy in to the policies of the national government and foreign donors. The value of Horning’s book comes from its linking of the local, national, and international levels of policy, showing that the three must be properly integrated for ecological efforts to work. Horning argues persuasively that people who live closest to natural resources must take full ownership of environmental programs."
4,Blood Papa: Rwanda’s New Generation,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2018-10-16/blood-papa-rwandas-new-generation,Blood Papa: Rwanda’s New Generation,"This is Hatzfeld’s fourth book on the Rwandan genocide. As in his previous work, he investigates the topic with remarkable empathy by allowing both Hutu and Tutsi people to recount their experiences in their own voices as they try to make sense of the events of 1994 and their legacy. In this book, Hatzfeld focuses on young Rwandans who were born either right before or right after the genocide. His Hutu subjects confront the mind-boggling crimes of their parents and ponder their own communal guilt. Young Tutsis, meanwhile, reflect on the violence that befell their relatives. Both sides wonder about the memories and qualities of the other, not always with much generosity. What emerges from the book is that a vast gulf continues to divide Hutus and Tutsis, even as both understand that they need to gure out how to live together. In its descriptions of everyday life, the book makes clear that the genocide and the prosecution of Hutu participants shape Rwandan society to this day. Yet the youthful voices of Hatzfeld’s subjects, preoccupied with romance, academic ambition, and idealism, also deliver some grounds for optimism."
5,"Food Aid in Sudan: A History of Power, Politics, and Profit",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2018-10-16/food-aid-sudan-history-power-politics-and-profit,"Food Aid in Sudan: A History of Power, Politics, and Profit","Jaspars begins this lively history of international food aid in Sudan by noting that the country has received foreign assistance for over 50 years and yet much of its population still has barely enough to eat. According to UN estimates, over six million Sudanese needed emergency help in 2016. Jaspars documents how ideas about food aid have changed over the decades but shows that successive reforms have failed to address key problems. She is particularly scathing about what she describes as the “medicalization” of food aid, under which programs no longer aim to ensure broad, self-sustaining access to food; they are designed merely to help people grow more resilient so that they can survive despite chronic insecurity. Jaspars concedes that donors, aid workers, and governments in Sudan and abroad have learned a lot about how to deliver food aid over the last half century, but she argues that this expertise is often ill used. Much of the food does not go to the most needy because the Sudanese government allows politics to dictate who gets what and donors either acquiesce or partly withdraw from the country in the face of political meddling."
6,"What Is China? Territory, Ethnicity, Culture, and History",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2018-10-16/what-china-territory-ethnicity-culture-and-history,"What Is China? Territory, Ethnicity, Culture, and History","This erudite polemic targets the aggressive nationalism that is widespread in China today. The author draws on a wide range of Chinese and foreign sources to describe how the majority Han ethnic group was forged, how it negotiated relations with surrounding peoples, and how China’s borders grew and shrank and grew again over time. He accepts that China has a distinct Han culture, characterized by a belief in an orderly moral hierarchy flowing from nature through the state, society, and family to the individual. But he denies that this culture is eternally fixed, essentially benevolent, or inherently superior, or that it can speak for China’s other ethnic groups. In a similar way, he sees China’s current borders as a product of history, not cosmically mandated or, as the Chinese government claims when speaking ofTibet, unaltered “since ancient times.” Only in the final chapter does he explilitly address what he calls “practical questions,” drawing together the threads of his argument to criticize those who use a mythicized version of history to justify a China-centric world order."
7,Blessings From Beijing: Inside China’s Soft-Power War on Tibet,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2018-10-16/blessings-beijing-inside-chinas-soft-power-war-tibet,Blessings From Beijing: Inside China’s Soft-Power War on Tibet,"The title of this book alludes to a sarcastic comment made by the Dalai Lama in 2009 about Chinese eorts to suppress the Tibetan diaspora. “Totalitarian regimes sort of pressure everywhere, even in the United States,” he said. “I think India and Nepal are receiving some special blessing from Peking.” There are about 130,000 Tibetan exiles living in the Indian city of Dharamsala (the site of the Central Tibetan Administration’s headquarters) and elsewhere in South Asia, Europe, and the United States. China has directed relentless, if not very successful, propaganda at the exiled community, has used its economic leverage over Nepal to block the traditional route for emigration from Tibet to India, and has played diplomatic hardball in its efforts to isolate the Dalai Lama internationally. Yet internal divisions among Tibetan exiles are even more threatening than China’s repression. Young Tibetans who move to the West identify less strongly with Tibet, many exiles and residents of Tibet are growing impatient with the Dalai Lama’s peaceful “middle way,” and the community has no visible succession plan that could keep it together after its leader’s passing. The Dalai Lama’s host, India, wants to avoid unduly antagonizing China, so it gives the Tibetans a temporary status that is less secure than refugee status or citizenship, heightening the exiles’ sense of insecurity."
8,"China, the United States, and the Future of Latin America; The Red Star and the Crescent: China and the Middle East",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2018-10-16/china-united-states-and-future-latin-america-red-star-and,"China, the United States, and the Future of Latin America; The Red Star and the Crescent: China and the Middle East","China’s influence is growing in different ways in different regions with different implications for U.S. interests. In two previous volumes in Denoon’s informative series on U.S.-Chinese relations, the focus was on Central Asia, where Beijing’s goals are predominantly economic and the United States is concerned chifley with the war in Afghanistan, and on the contrasting situation in Southeast Asia, where China and the United States are engaged in a multifaceted economic and strategic competition. This third volume, dealing with Latin America and the Caribbean, presents a complex picture that lies somewhere between the previous two. Denoon and the other contributors describe China’s rapidly growing presence as a buyer of raw materials, supplier of manufactured goods, builder of infrastructure, investor, and donor. Some of the contributors believe that China is also pursuing greater military and ideological inuence in Latin America, especially with regimes that are in economic trouble or at odds with the United States, such as the one in Venezuela. With Washington doing little to shore up its position on the continent and Beijing accumulating more interests to protect, a serious challenge to U.S. preeminence in the region may not be inevitable, but it is no longer unthinkable."
9,Human Rights in Thailand,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2018-10-16/human-rights-thailand,Human Rights in Thailand,"In 1997, during a democratic phase, Thailand established the National Human Rights Commission. (The commission still exists, although its work has suffered since the most recent military coup, in 2014.) Selby observed the commission’s staff and activist lawyers over several years as they worked to improve the way the Thai police treated Burmese migrant workers and to help victims ofland seizures. His observations led him to reject the “Asian values” thesis, the idea that human rights are a foreign transplant that Asian societies commonly reject. Thai practitioners, he notes, built their concept of rights out of local ideas, such as Buddhist compassion, and advocated on behalf of victims in ways that drew on local norms, such as saving face and honoring mothers. The point is well taken, but Selby understates the cosmopolitan aspects of the Thai human rights movement. Thai nongovernmental organizations rely on foreign funding, advocates use international human rights law as a benchmark for pressuring the government, and the very idea ofestablishing national human rights institutions originally came from a 1993 UN General Assembly resolution."
10,Political Corruption and Scandals in Japan,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2018-10-16/political-corruption-and-scandals-japan,Political Corruption and Scandals in Japan,"Japan has had some spectacular cases of corruption, such as the 1976 Lockheed scandal, in which politicians took bribes to buy airplanes, and the 1988 Recruit scandal, in which a Japanese company sold shares to politicians at articially low prices. It has also seen a steady stream of garden-variety bureaucratic corruption, campaign law violations, and sex scandals. But this book avoids gossip in favor of analysis. The authors identify three types of corruption—bad-apple corruption, standard-operating-procedure corruption, and systemic corruption—and assess what kinds of reforms have been effective in reducing each. The biggest improvement came after reforms to the electoral system in 1994, which shifted the electoral system for the lower house from one of multimember districts to one of single-member districts (plus additional seats allocated proportionally) and thus reduced the prevalence of patronage politics. Rules mandating transparency have also helped. Carlson and Reed conclude that reform has made Japanese democracy healthier but that nothing can completely eliminate misbehavior by politicians."
11,Censored: Distraction and Diversion Inside China’s Great Firewall,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2018-10-16/censored-distraction-and-diversion-inside-chinas-great-firewall,Censored: Distraction and Diversion Inside China’s Great Firewall,"Roberts disputes the conventional wisdom that the Chinese government exerts near-total control over the Internet. Instead, she shows that Beijing uses “porous censorship,” accomplished by techniques she labels “fear, friction, and flooding.” The first consists of threats and punishments aimed at deterring the most vocal critics from posting online. The second consists of blocks that make it dicult, but not impossible, for ordinary users to access undesirable content. The third involves inundating the Internet with information the government wants people to see. Using some innovative research techniques, Roberts shows that most users, having only limited time and energy, settle for the information they can readily get. She argues that porous control is more effective than total control, because it is less conspicuous and arouses little opposition. Roberts focuses on the Internet, but her argument also applies to what China does in print and broadcast media. And as she points out, similar techniques are popping up elsewhere in the world, as well, including in democracies, where governments promote or hide information and Internet providers tweak algorithms to inuence what users see."
12,Tunisia: An Arab Anomaly,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2018-10-16/tunisia-arab-anomaly,Tunisia: An Arab Anomaly,"Tunisia is the only Arab state to remain on the path to democracy after the Arab Spring. Masri tries to explain why. Tunisia has existed in one form or another within more or less its current borders for millennia. It underwent a long series of basic reforms in the mid-nineteenth century that led to a progressive definition of women’s rights, tolerance of religious minorities, and, eventually, state secularism. That history makes Tunisia unique, Masri notes, and means that the rest of the Arab world is unlikely to follow its path to democracy. Masri pays particular attention to the country’s educational system, contrasting it with the dismal conditions elsewhere in the region. Masri’s rendering of Tunisia does not offer much new information; it is his conclusion, in which he worries that the country’s nasty neighborhood will ultimately devour this promising experiment in democracy, that makes the book so noteworthy."
13,The Political Economy of Reforms in Egypt: Issues and Policymaking Since 1952,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2018-10-16/political-economy-reforms-egypt-issues-and-policymaking-1952,The Political Economy of Reforms in Egypt: Issues and Policymaking Since 1952,"This outstanding book puts Egypt’s economic history in the context of those of other developing countries, comparing it to such histories in East Asia and Latin America. Ikram skillfully weaves economic theory into his account of Egyptian economic policies over the last half century and assesses the role and effectiveness of foreign aid. He shows that even if Egypt implemented the right policies, it likely could not replicate the success enjoyed by East Asian countries. Major attempts at reform in 1977 and 1991 failed to create a sustainable, healthy economy. Egypt saves and invests too little and suffers from low productivity, and government spending and borrowing are both high. Successive governments have filled the gaps in their budgets by relying on oil money, funding from allies such as the United States, and remittances from workers abroad. Ikram does not offer a path forward other than recommending that Egypt overhaul its institutions and improve its productivity. Egypt today has over 100 million inhabitants, who by and large live much better than their predecessors did 50 years ago. As Ikram rightly says, “One must not underestimate the country’s resilience.”"
14,Into the Hands of the Soldiers: Freedom and Chaos in Egypt and the Middle East,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2018-10-16/hands-soldiers-freedom-and-chaos-egypt-and-middle-east,Into the Hands of the Soldiers: Freedom and Chaos in Egypt and the Middle East,"There are many accounts of the Egyptian revolution of 2011, the country’s first free elections the next year, and the subsequent military coup that deposed the new president, Mohamed Morsi, but this book offers the best retelling yet. Kirkpatrick was present for many of the main events, including the massacre of hundreds of members of the Muslim Brotherhood by the Egyptian security forces in August 2013. Kirkpatrick’s account makes clear that for him, there were few good guys and one overwhelmingly bad guy: Egypt’s “deep state.” The United States, meanwhile, comes across as ignorant and confused. U.S. President Barack Obama and his ambassador to Egypt, Anne Patterson, were lonely voices arguing that the U.S. government should respect the electoral process. John Kerry, U.S. secretary of state; Chuck Hagel, U.S. secretary of defense; James Mattis, the head of U.S. Central Command; and Michael Flynn, the director of the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency, all supported the military, whatever the cost, as an asset in the fight against Islamic extremism. They won the argument, and Egypt’s current president, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, has since cracked down on human rights to an extent that would have made his predecessors blush."
15,Salman’s Legacy: The Dilemmas of a New Era in Saudi Arabia,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2018-10-16/salmans-legacy-dilemmas-new-era-saudi-arabia,Salman’s Legacy: The Dilemmas of a New Era in Saudi Arabia,"The merit of this collection of essays comes from the critical stance it takes toward the Saudi ruling family. In her contribution, Rasheed argues that the top-down, arbitrary power acquired by the royal family over the past several decades cannot be explained by looking at the rational interests of the rulers and the ruled; rather, it involves religious and mystical factors. She and other contributors suggest that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s plans to distance the regime from Wahhabism, the fundamentalist religious sect, may severely weaken the dynasty. A brief contribution by the analyst Cole Bunzel reveals the deep reserves of respect that most senior members of the House of Saud still have for extremist Wahhabi leaders. All the contributors accept that there are direct links between Wahhabism and violent jihadism, but as Rasheed points out, many, including the United States, have often chosen to overlook them. In the only chapter on the kingdom’s economy, the political scientist Steen Hertog explores the structural difficulties that the crown prince’s proposed reforms will encounter, pointing out that Saudi Arabia suffers from a combination of high costs and low productivity."
16,State of Repression: Iraq Under Saddam Hussein,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2018-10-16/state-repression-iraq-under-saddam-hussein,State of Repression: Iraq Under Saddam Hussein,"In 1989, the Iraqi dissident Kanan Makiya published Republic of Fear, a terrifying look at Iraq under Saddam Hussein’s violent, totalitarian rule. Ever since, the world has recognized that Saddam was no run-of-the-mill autocrat. In this carefully structured analysis, Blaydes draws on Iraqi secret police files to argue that Saddam, brutal as he was, was trapped by Iraq’s unique characteristics into adopting repressive but self-destructive policies. The key problem, Blaydes suggests, was that language, geography, and other barriers made it dicult for the regime to “read” some groups within Iraqi society. The authorities knew the least about the Shiites and the Kurds. Those groups were subjected to collective punishment, resulting in collective resistance. Repression was more finely targeted when it came to the Sunnis. Those closest to Saddam’s birthplace of Tikrit were rewarded, whereas more peripheral Sunnis were deprived and grew resentful as a result. Yet the idea that Saddam’s exceptional brutishness resulted from Iraq’s exceptional complexity is not entirely convincing. Iran, Lebanon, and Syria are just as complex as Iraq, after all, but have vastly dierent regimes."

18,Do Nuclear Weapons Matter?,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/issue-packages/2018-10-15/do-nuclear-weapons-matter,What’s Inside,"It is obvious that nuclear weapons are incredibly important. Vast sums are spent on them, concerns about their spread—most recently, to North Korea and Iran—dominate headlines, and they could blow up the world in a flash."
19,Armed and Dangerous,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/north-korea/2018-10-15/armed-and-dangerous,Armed and Dangerous,"There have always been good reasons to worry about nuclear weapons, but those reasons have changed over time. During the Cold War, U.S. national security experts fretted about an expensive nuclear arms race with the Soviet Union. After the 9/11 attacks, specialists and the American public alike were afraid that terrorists might get their hands on highly enriched uranium and make a primitive nuclear device. Those dangers remain. But the first concern has been mitigated to some degree by strategic arms control agreements between the United States and Russia, which are still in place (although not always adhered to). And the second concern has been ameliorated through a significant reduction in the amount of highly enriched uranium used in research reactors around the world."
20,Fryderyk Chopin: A Life and Times,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2018-10-18/fryderyk-chopin-life-and-times,Fryderyk Chopin: A Life and Times,"Fryderyk Chopin’s music is one of Europe’s great cultural legacies. Many of his compositions were based on Polish folk tunes and reflected Chopin’s nostalgia for a homeland that he left early and to which he never returned. Chopin did not live long: he was born in 1810 and died in 1849. Yet those 39 years were extraordinary, and not one paragraph of this meticulously researched and often poignant account is wasted. Chopin began composing memorable works at the age of seven; a few years later, he dismissed his only piano teacher. Despite his virtuoso talent, he hated playing in public so much that he did so less than two dozen times as an adult, in part because his uniquely delicate tone could not fill large spaces. Chopin’s music often seems improvised, yet he was a dogged perfectionist, drafting and redrafting even his shortest pieces. He was a fastidiously polite, almost aristocratic figure. Yet for a decade, he scandalized society by living with the cross-dressing author George Sand. Chopin suffered from tuberculosis for nearly 20 years, sometimes coughing up bowls full of blood, until it finally killed him. Yet throughout, he found ways to sublimate longing, frustration, and pain into transcendent masterpieces."
21,The Grand Strategy of the Habsburg Empire,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2018-10-16/grand-strategy-habsburg-empire,The Grand Strategy of the Habsburg Empire,"In 1914, the Habsburg empire’s fatal combination of belligerence and weakness triggered World War I and, four years later, the empire’s own dissolution. This graceful account of Habsburg diplomacy from 1700 to that fateful moment explains how the empire survived so long: its diplomats dampened threats through minor acts of appeasement, always playing for time. The most celebrated case of this strategy came after the Napoleonic Wars, when Prince Metternich, the empire’s chancellor, constructed the Concert of Europe, a system for preserving the balance of power and deflecting the hostility of the Habsburgs’ stronger neighbors: the Russian, German, and Ottoman empires. Mitchell synthesizes rather than challenges existing interpretations, and his portrait of unitary states managing the military balance is a bit archaic. But the book deserves attention for other reasons. Mitchell currently serves as U.S. assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs and seeks to identify lessons for today’s U.S. policymakers from the Habsburgs’ experience. He convincingly criticizes the Habsburg empire for rampant “anti-intellectualism” in its foreign policy; for provoking and ultimately empowering, rather than subtly deflecting, its enemies; for overspending on its military; and, most important, for alienating its allies through “self-isolation.” The Trump administration ought to keep these lessons in mind."
22,Scots and Catalans: Union and Disunion,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2018-10-16/scots-and-catalans-union-and-disunion,Scots and Catalans: Union and Disunion,"In this erudite and engaging book, Elliott, one of the most distinguished historians of early modern Spain, explores the similarities and differences between Scottish and Catalan nationalism. The two movements’ histories run in striking parallel, starting with the construction of their founding myths five centuries ago and moving through common stages of rebellion, dynastic union, nation-statehood, home rule, and, finally, the clamor for independence. Despite the book’s magisterial scope and subtle detail, however, a lack of method hampers the analysis. Elliott is an old-school historian; for him, great men, wars, and national interests drive policy. He is less interested in analyzing the masses, something that requires a firm grasp of popular psychology, social change, and ground-level politics. Ignoring these factors leaves him perplexed about why separatism is rising in both places. “There seems no good reason,” he says. Nor can he sort out why Catalan nationalists appear more fervent than their Scottish counterparts. Is it their distinct language, the potential economic gains of indepen-dence, their sometimes more repressive central government, failures of imagination by Scottish leaders, indoctrination by pro-independence Catalan governments, or some combination of these factors? Or is it just chance? Elliott cannot say."
23,The Use and Misuse of Economic Statecraft,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/world/2018-10-15/use-and-misuse-economic-statecraft,The Use and Misuse of Economic Statecraft,"Since the end of the Cold War, the United States has come to rely more and more on economic tools to advance its foreign policy goals. Some of these tools, such as sanctions, involve the direct application of economic pressure. Others, such as the promotion of free trade and open markets, work by changing other countries’ incentives. But all of them rest on a recognition that unrivaled economic power gives the United States a singular capacity to pursue its interests without resorting to force."
24,Complexity’s Embrace: The International Law Implications of Brexit,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2018-10-16/complexitys-embrace-international-law-implications-brexit,Complexity’s Embrace: The International Law Implications of Brexit,"To understand what Brexit really means, throw away your newspapers and podcasts and read this book instead. Pro-Brexitpundits and populist politicians proclaim that the situation is simple. Two years ago, they told British referendum voters that Brexit was about reclaiming democracy, sovereignty, and identity. Yet the British government’s effort to implement the voters’ will has revealed the opposite: Brexit has created an almost unfathomable amount of complexity. Millions of EU rules and regulations govern industrial trade, farming, banking, intellectual property, consumer safety, the environment, human rights, energy, and much else. Brexit means the United Kingdom must first rewrite all these rules and then realign them with those of the EU and 180 countries across the globe in order to maintain economic relations with them. In this book, a group of European legal specialists examine the practical issues the British are up against, covering topics as varied as what regional electrical grids are permissible under EU law, how to manage bankruptcies of multinational companies, and which types of parody the EU’s intellectual property rules allow."

U.S. President Donald Trump has started a trade war with China, upended the North American Free Trade Agreement, imposed tariffs on the United States’ closest allies, withdrawn from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and talked endlessly about building a wall on the U.S.-Mexican border. But the backlash against globalization goes far beyond Trump himself. In fact, his presidency is more a symptom of it than its cause. Even as they may decry Trump’s particular methods, many voters and politicians in both parties approve of his objectives."
27,The Unheard Nerds,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/review-essay/2018-10-15/unheard-nerds,The Unheard Nerds,"An uncomfortable truth for American economists is that they have limited influence on economic policy. Take trade, for example. Anyone who has studied introductory economics knows that free trade benefits countries in the long run, by allowing them to specialize in producing the goods and services in which they have a comparative advantage. Economists are in near-universal agreement about this point, although most also agree that it is important to help workers who lose their jobs in the short run because of trade."
28,"Journey Into Europe: Islam, Immigration, and Identity",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2018-10-16/journey-europe-islam-immigration-and-identity,"Journey Into Europe: Islam, Immigration, and Identity","This sprawling book by a Pakistani diplomat and anthropologist examines why relations between Muslims and non-Muslims in Europe are so contentious—and what might be done about it. The author and his research team spent four years interviewing Muslims in Europe, including many religious and community leaders. Their troubling, if unsurprising, finding: Muslims feel disadvantaged, stereotyped, and marginalized. Sadly, the book has little to say about the roots of these perceptions. Ahmed seems more interested in his policy prescription: to override Muslim extremists and white nationalists alike in favor of a more tolerant and pluralistic European culture. That is a laudable goal, but Ahmed’s vague proposal—to reform modern Europe along the lines of medieval Muslim Spain—seems far-fetched and inappropriate, not least because medieval tolerance was a strategy designed to accommodate a popular majority. Even if Ahmed’s project were feasible and desirable, the rest of his vision is too hazy to resolve the everyday disputes that would still arise over how people dress, whom they marry, and what political ideals they favor."

At the time, the country’s military dictator, President Pervez Musharraf, was busy explaining to Pakistanis that they were in the middle of a do-or-die battle against militants—although it seemed that, for ordinary people, this mostly involved dying. People all over the country were wary of prayer leaders preaching about jihad or creating pretexts for others to wage it."

The emergence of al Qaeda, cybercriminals, and other dangerous entities affirmed the threat of nonstate actors. But equally daunting has been the resurgence of outlaw regimes—rogue states that defy international norms, fail to respect human rights and fundamental freedoms, and act against the security of the American people, U.S. allies and partners, and the rest of the world."

But according to the 2016–17 Healthy Minds Study, an annual survey of mental health on American college campuses, while 44 percent of students said that they were flourishing, 39 percent reported experiencing symptoms of depression or anxiety. The proportion of students experiencing suicidal ideation has grown from six percent in 2007 to 11 percent in 2017. The percentage of students receiving psychotherapy has jumped from 13 percent to 24 percent over the same period. Even though more students are getting help, only a little more than half of those with symptoms of depression and anxiety had received treatment in the previous year."
32,Nuclear Weapons Don’t Matter,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/world/nuclear-weapons-dont-matter,Nuclear Weapons Don’t Matter,"The unleashed power of the atom,” Albert Einstein wrote in 1946, “has changed everything save our modes of thinking, and we thus drift toward unparalleled catastrophe.” Winston Churchill noted in 1955, however, that nuclear deterrence might produce stability instead and predicted that “safety will be the sturdy child of terror, and survival the twin brother of annihilation.” Einstein’s view became the touchstone of the modern peace movement. Churchill’s view evolved into mainstream Western nuclear strategy and doctrine. Both argued that the nuclear revolution had fundamentally transformed international politics. Both were wrong."
33,Our American Israel: The Story of an Entangled Alliance,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2018-10-16/our-american-israel-story-entangled-alliance,Our American Israel: The Story of an Entangled Alliance,"Kaplan’s perspective as a scholar of American studies provides the key insight of this book: that the United States’ affinity for Israel has less to do with American Jewish activism than with deep cultural forces that have manifested themselves on both the left and the right over the years. In the 1940s and 1950s, for example, the left was the source of Israel’s most vocal U.S. support. Kaplan’s sympathies lie not just with the left in general but also with the pro-Palestinian trend that has supplanted the left’s earlier Zionism, and perhaps as a result, the book is better at analyzing the myths and assumptions behind right-wing pro-Israel sentiment today than at examining the equally fascinating mythmaking behind contemporary left-wing views. Kaplan largely ignores the international context of views on Israel, apparently forgetting that the European left was even more pro-Israel than the U.S. left until the 1967 Arab-Israeli war, and so her otherwise keen analysis misses some important detail. Even so, Kaplan’s approach is so fresh, her command of the sources so solid, and her prose so engaging that both casual readers and experts will find new insights in the book."

In this detailed and diverting book, the Heidlers look at something quite different but equally relevant: the political and media machinery that Andrew Jackson’s core supporters erected to assist his presidential bids. The Heidlers call these savvy media manipulators and occasional purveyors of fake news “Jacksonites” rather than “Jacksonians” to reflect the fact that some of them were more interested in associating with a successful presidential candidate than in promoting Jackson’s (often inchoate) ideas. The Jacksonites created a network of patronage and media influence that led to positive press coverage for Jackson across the country, and they leaped into action to suppress unfavorable reports, including accounts of Jackson’s many incivilities and gaffes. The Jacksonites did not invent collusion between politicians and journalists, but they did create the integrated approach to media that made mass politics possible and continues to this day."

She argues on the basis of psychological research that humans are hard-wired to prefer members of their own tribe and to regard outsiders with suspicion. Chua argues that American ignorance about the power of tribalism led U.S. officials to make costly errors in Vietnam, Iraq, and elsewhere. Her second point is more controversial: that the rise of identity politics is linked to a resurgent American tribalism that will ultimately divide Americans and undermine their common identity and the common good. Chua’s speculations about the future of U.S. politics are interesting, if unsettling; her portrayal of the consequences in foreign policy of ignorance about the power of group identity should be required reading for U.S. policymakers."

Calhoun believed, a pro-slavery document, or did it, as President Abraham Lincoln argued, deny slavery a place in national law and point toward abolition? Although most Americans outside the academy would assume that Calhoun was wrong and Lincoln right, the contrary view has gained so much ground among academics in recent years that Wilentz’s qualified endorsement of Lincoln’s interpretation is both bracing and brave. Wilentz’s thoroughly researched argument serves as a useful example of solid scholarship and effective writing on a sensitive topic. It also highlights the growing importance of historians to legal studies as the federal bench fills with originalist interpreters of the Constitution. Wilentz is not an originalist himself, but the historical methods he employs here to uncover the intended meaning of the Constitution are exactly those that originalists use. Lawyers and jurists looking to develop arguments that will impress conservative judges would be well advised to study the tools Wilentz deploys to such great effect."

It comes after a shocking few years in which the abuse of the Internet has had profound political consequences. Belligerents now prepare for Twitter wars at the same time as conventional ones. Activists understand the subversive potential of online campaigns, but so do governments that seek to stifle them. The Chinese government has built the most extensive mechanisms to prevent free expression and weed out dissent, showing the way forward for authoritarian states everywhere. Meanwhile, the main online platforms—Facebook, Google, and Twitter—have come to realize how their creations have been used to stir up hate and spread false stories, and they are belatedly wrestling with ways to curb the worst offences. Singer and Brooking explain not only how this new information environment developed but also why our attitudes and behaviors are so susceptible to manipulation."

Speier began his academic career studying the sociology of knowledge, and after he arrived in the United States, he directed the U.S. government’s propaganda effort against Germany. The debates recounted in Bessner’s biography between Speier and other officials over how to develop effective campaigns are particularly fascinating in the context of contemporary worries about information warfare. Speier relished his influential advisory role in government and later drew on his experience at the new RAND Corporation, where he made sure that academic work still flowed to senior policymakers. Bessner’s book, which largely focuses on the intellectual and says little about Speier’s personal life, picks up on an issue that bothered Speier but did not ultimately deter him from his work: What are the implications for democracy when unelected experts, often working in secret, shape government policy?"

It then imagines that the North’s air defenses shoot down a South Korean civilian airliner, sparking a crisis that escalates rapidly to nuclear war. Although the book is a work of fiction, each step in the plot is backed up by research into past incidents and current capabilities. The war snowballs thanks to a risky retaliation by South Korean President Moon Jae-in, undertaken without consulting the United States (the part of the book that is the least convincing). The crisis is worsened by the dys-function of the Trump administration—including, inevitably, a tweet from U.S. President Donald Trump that convinces North Korean leader Kim Jong Un that the South’s attack is part of a coordinated effort to topple his regime. Although the plot is not entirely persuasive, one does not have to accept every aspect to appreciate Lewis’ warnings about the dangers of poor communication within governments and between states and how exaggerated claims by leaders, for example, about the effectiveness of their missile defense systems, create risks."

Because a declaration of war brings burdensome legal consequences, the simplest approach is to find a euphemism to describe the conflict. In this intriguing book, Fazal argues that this is a consequence of the separation between the lawyers who write international humanitarian law and the military personnel who have to follow it. As a result, the laws have become so complex and demanding that even states that intend to comply with them sometimes struggle to do so. The situation has been further complicated by the rise of civil wars, for which the laws of war were not designed. The idea that ill-judged regulations can produce perverse incentives is not new, but Fazal’s analysis of this tendency within the laws of war skillfully blends quantitative and qualitative methods to produce something genuinely original."

As Gandal points out, battle was far from the typical experience. Many would-be conscripts were deemed unfit for service, most of those who passed their physical exams were given jobs away from the frontlines, and many of those assigned combat roles never saw any fighting. A lot of young men, therefore, came away with a sense of personal failure. And since the selection of officers was based on merit rather than social class or ethnicity (except for African Americans, who were excluded as a group), many men resented watching those they considered their social inferiors giving orders. Much of the postwar literature, Gandal argues, was therefore about emasculation more than danger. He shows how unsatisfactory wartime experiences informed the fiction of a range of writers, including William Faulkner and Ernest Hemingway, both of whom lied about their military roles in later years."

Each year, these amount to an estimated $500 billion, three times the annual total spent by governments, aid agencies, and charities on foreign assistance to poor countries. Germano has carried out extensive fieldwork in the Americas, but the book also covers other parts of the world, including Africa and the Middle East. As he explains, remittances amount to a kind of “outsourcing” of welfare that immigrants’ home countries do not or cannot provide. Recipients use them to pay for a wide variety of things, including medical care, clothing, and food for themselves and their children."
43,Renewables: The Politics of a Global Energy Transition,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2018-10-16/renewables-politics-global-energy-transition,Renewables: The Politics of a Global Energy Transition,"The world is going through a slow transition from coal and oil to renewables, mainly solar and wind power, as its main sources of energy. This is partly due to the much higher price of oil and partly to cost-cutting technological breakthroughs and greater practical experience using solar and wind power. But those factors don’t explain the whole story, since different economies have adopted renewable technologies at very different speeds. Aklin and Urpelainen persuasively argue that a combination of domestic politics and external shocks, such as the OPEC oil price hikes of the mid-1970s and the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster, has led to different levels of support for renewables from country to country. The book usefully documents the most important shocks and explains how domestic policies have changed since the 1970s, focusing on Denmark, Germany, and the United States."

The authors combine information from household surveys, national income accounts, and tax records to create what is sure to become a standard source for data on income and wealth inequality. Since 1980, the distribution of income, as measured by the shares of total national income earned by the top one percent, the top ten percent, and the bottom 50 percent, has grown more unequal in all but one of the countries studied. (The exception is Brazil, where inequality has declined but still exceeds the levels in most other countries.) Although increases in inequality differ greatly across countries, in most, inequality has grown in income earned from labor, such as wages, and in income derived from the ownership of capital, such as stock dividends. Data on wealth are public for far fewer countries, but the information that is available shows that the distribution of wealth has also grown more unequal. The editors end the book with a discussion of various policies that could reduce these inequalities."

The categories cover not only natural disasters, such as earthquakes and tsunamis, but also risks arising from employee behavior, regulations, and financial shocks caused by human error or by the wider political, social, and economic environments. The resulting damage can be physical, financial, or reputational. The authors urge corporations to plan for potentially catastrophic incidents, even remote ones, and to train teams to deal with unexpected events when they occur. The authors offer many concrete examples of companies that dealt successfully with the unforeseen, and of ones that failed, and show how those that did better had learned from the experience of others."

Lomborg’s think tank, the Copenhagen Consensus Center, thought that was too many, so it brought together a group of economists to conduct a cost-benefit analysis of each one (except for those that were too qualitative to evaluate). This useful book is the result, covering topics ranging from air pollution to water and sanitation. For each SDG, the contributors assess how much the world will have to spend and what it will get for the money. Prioritizing is important, since governments and donors will not be able to spend nearly enough to meet all the targets. The contributors conclude that the highest return would come from completing the stalled Doha Round of trade negotiations, which they estimate would boost the global economy by over $2,000 for each $1 spent. On the other hand, they project that trying to meet some other targets, such as guaranteeing employment for everyone, would return less than it would cost. The book concludes that apart from trade liberalization, the highest payoffs would come from immunizing vulnerable populations, reducing malnutrition among young children, and fighting tuberculosis."

But since the end of the Cold War, the idea has been strangely absent. Paul argues that the idea of a balance of power is not dead; it has simply taken new, more peaceful forms, which he calls “soft balancing.” This seems to have been largely driven by economic interdependence, which has made it more costly for great powers to disrupt markets by splitting the world into competing blocs. The modern global norm of territorial integrity and the availability of nuclear weapons both serve to deter great-power aggression and make balancing less necessary. And the creation of international institutions has given the United States and China ways to signal their restraint and thus dampen the worries that might otherwise push other countries to balance against them. U.S. President Donald Trump’s “America first” strategy and China’s growing military power will put his thesis to the test."

Modernization theory has gone in and out of fashion over the years, as critics have questioned its Western biases and its vision of universal pathways of development. Yet in previous work using data from the World Values Survey, Inglehart has identified systematic connections between long-term economic changes and shifts in attitudes on gender equality, religion, and democratic values. In this book, Inglehart offers a restatement of modernization theory, focusing on the links between economic and physical security and tolerance of outsiders and openness to new ideas. For most of history, people lived under the constant threat of violence and disease, leading societies to emphasize solidarity with fellow members, conformity to group norms, and suspicion of outsiders. Inglehart argues that in the second half of the twentieth century, industrialization, urbanization, and mass literacy systematically reduced the “existential insecurity” of vast numbers of people, making modern societies more open and tolerant. Inglehart claims that these more liberal societies generated a surge in democratization in the 1990s. Now, he sees a creeping return of economic insecurity in the rich world, which is opening the door to intolerance and authoritarianism."

In this smart and sophisticated book, Beckley tackles this thesis head-on. He does not dispute that the United States has its problems or that misguided leaders often squander its advantages. But he points out that the United States’ deep geographic, demographic, and institutional reserves give the country unique resilience. The United States is the only great power without regional rivals. Its companies and universities dominate the world. And most important, Beckley argues that it has by far the best fundamentals for future economic growth, thanks to its abundant natural resources, favorable demographics, secure property rights, and lasting political institutions. China’s growth prospects, in contrast, are “dismal.” Beckley also thinks the declinists use the wrong measures of power. GDP, for example, exaggerates the influence of populous but poor countries, such as China, while overlooking problems that drain those countries’ economic and military resources. He does not argue that the United States can—or should—try to preserve the unipolar era, but he does think that it will long remain the world’s leading power."
50,Can Democracy Work?,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2018-10-16/can-democracy-work,Can Democracy Work?,"Many people today worry that John Adams might have been onto something when he observed that “there has never been a democracy yet that did not commit suicide.” Miller tries to put these worries in perspective by tracing the tumultuous history of democracy from its ancient Athenian origins through the American and French Revolutions to the populist upheavals afoot today. What makes the book compelling is its focus on colorful thinkers, activists, and political leaders who lived and breathed the democratic moment throughout history, from Pericles and Socrates in ancient Athens to Woodrow Wilson and Vladimir Lenin in the early twentieth century. Miller shows that democracy’s ascent is best seen not as a gradual unfolding of a political principle driven by reason and moral destiny but rather as a grand roller coaster ride of struggle, revolution, and backlash. Today’s populist outbursts look quite ordinary alongside this history. Miller’s message is that democracy is not just a fixed set of governing institutions; it is, as the French political theorist Alexis de Tocqueville argued, a way of life. If democracy is to survive, the first imperative is to recognize its fragility and step forward and defend it."

For some, it is the Lockean idea of individual rights and limited government; for others, it is the doctrine of the modern welfare state. In this lively and penetrating book, Rosenblatt offers an intellectual history of the term, from its roots in Roman notions of civic duty and public morality down to its modern use. She shows how the idea was “Christianized, democratized, socialized, and politicized” over the centuries. She also challenges the traditional narrative of liberalism as an Anglo-American project, placing greater emphasis on nineteenth-century French and German thinkers who tried to conjure up “liberal principles” of politics—the rule of law, civic equality, constitutionalism, and freedom of the press and religion—that could answer the radical forces unleashed by the French Revolution. It was only in the twentieth century, particularly during the Cold War, that liberalism became a uniquely American creed of individualism and political rights. Rosenblatt shows that liberalism has survived thanks to its appeal as a moral ideal, a vision of political community that is based not just on interests but also on values: respect, tolerance, and justice."

Nationalism and populism are surging in the United States and Europe, at the expense of liberal internationalism and democratic values.

Such foundations played a crucial role in building the liberal international order that has come under assault in recent years, and that the United States seems less willing to defend than ever before."

Those working in this area call these efforts “transitional justice,” but David believes the label is too imprecise. He takes the example of the Czech Republic, which has employed an array of mechanisms meant to deliver justice for its communist past. He identifies four main types: “retributive” (punishing the perpetrators), “reparatory” (compen- sating the victims), “revelatory” (exposing the guilty and their abuses), and “reconciliatory” (offering apologies). The results depend on who is being targeted— those once loyal to the system, those who suffered, or society at large. David employs a variety of survey data to conclude that the ambitious Czech effort has largely failed. Neither punishing the perpetrators nor compensating the victims is enough, unless the former repudiate the system of which they were a part."
55,Tito and His Comrades,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2018-10-16/tito-and-his-comrades,Tito and His Comrades,"Josip Broz, later known as Marshal Tito, was born in 1892 and died in 1980; he lived for almost twice as long as the country that he led as president existed. His biography has been picked over many times. Early treatments of his life tended to be official hagiographies; more recent ones, written after Yugoslavia’s collapse, have often demonized him. Even the best of them, as the historian Emily Greble writes in the foreword to this book, aimed “to investigate Yugoslavia’s place in the global history of the Second World War and the Cold War rather than to understand the country’s leader.” Pirjevec fills this gap with a dispassionate and meticulously detailed account of Tito’s life from his birth into grueling peasant poverty, to his struggles as a member of the nascent Yugoslav Communist Party in Moscow during Stalin’s Great Purge, and finally to his complex relationships with key comrades across the tumultuous decades that followed. It is no small feat to capture the essence of a figure in whom courage, stalwartness, and even compassion mixed with cunning, ego, and brutality—for example, he never confessed to second thoughts about ordering the massacre of over 100,000 “collaborationists” at the end of World War II—but Pirjevec succeeds handsomely."

But Schimpfössl argues that is an outdated image, more suited to the 1990s than today. Russia’s current super-rich are less interested in flaunting their wealth than in the quest for social respectability and an image of refinement, even moral probity. Like the very wealthy elsewhere, they see their good fortune as the product of their talents and superior qualities, which they often attribute to their genetic heritage. Their sense of superiority, desire to separate themselves from “the tasteless rich,” and pursuit of legitimacy have led them to give to charity, support the arts, and help foster civil society. Schimpfössl’s book benefits from the long parade of interviews she has conducted with nearly 100 of these millionaires and billionaires, their families, and their associates, which put a human face on her analysis."

Most such accounts treat religion and atheism as simple opposites. Smolkin describes a more nuanced and variable relationship between them. She lays out three main “oppositions” at the heart of the contest: one political, between communist ideological purity and effective governance; one ideological, between superstition and science; and one spiritual, between “emptiness and indifference and fullness and conviction.” How the regime managed the balance in each case changed radically over time. It began with a wholesale assault on religion as a threat to the communist project, moved toward tolerance during World War II in order to rally national unity, then renewed the assault under Nikita Khrushchev in the 1950s and 1960s, and, in the Soviet Union’s later years, reached a kind of coexistence that recognized the need for atheism to create a spirituality that could match that offered by religion."
58,The Code of Putinism,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2018-10-16/code-putinism,The Code of Putinism,"“Putin is Russia, and Russia is Putin,” the Russian politician Vyacheslav Volodin famously commented in 2014. Most Americans believe the same thing, although they do not mean it as a compliment. Taylor argues that this misses Russian President Vladimir Putin’s role as the centerpiece of something more complex: “Putinism,” a “solar system” of interlocking and often competing clans. To understand how these informal networks govern the country and carry out foreign policy, one needs to know the “code” that guides them, which Taylor says includes ideas, habits, and emotions. The key ideas behind Putinism are the need for a strong state, anti-Westernism, and conservatism. Putinism’s habits express themselves in preferences for control, unity, loyalty, and “hypermasculinity.” And its emotions come out in its preoccupation with respect, resentment, and fear. The code, Taylor argues, explains Russia’s drift toward authoritarianism and its aggressive foreign policy. He concludes that Putinism has created a domestic political order that can be controlled but not easily modernized and that Russian foreign policy is “overambitious” and ultimately counterproductive. The political system is likely doomed to “a slow muddling down,” although he does not see Putinism ending anytime soon."
59,The Dawn of Eurasia: On the Trail of the New World Order,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/dawn-eurasia-trail-new-world-order,The Dawn of Eurasia: On the Trail of the New World Order,"For six months, Maçães traveled across a portion of Eurasia to see how the world is changing. The future, he argues in this startlingly original assessment, will be dominated by an emerging Eurasian “supercontinent,” shaped by China’s, Russia’s, and the EU’s competing visions. The Arctic will become one of its superhighways, and the roads and railways envisaged in China’s vast Belt and Road Initiative will tie it together. The fusing of Europe and Asia, he contends, is already far more advanced than most realize. The drama is over what form this integration will take, but he is confident that it will be different from the political and economic models familiar in the West. In the second part of the book, Maçães gives texture and immediacy to his broader argument by sharing images and discoveries he made during his many diversions from familiar paths, skillfully integrating his travel stories into the larger trends he discusses: trade flows, megaprojects, changing lifestyles, new transport links, and the visions of those designing the future in Beijing and Moscow."
60,Empire by Invitation: William Walker and Manifest Destiny in Central America,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2018-10-16/empire-invitation-william-walker-and-manifest-destiny-central,Empire by Invitation: William Walker and Manifest Destiny in Central America,"This account of the life and times of the American adventurer William Walker, who briefly seized the presidency of Nicaragua in the 1850s, defies the conventional wisdom, which holds that Walker was bent on adding new slave states to the United States. Gobat paints him instead as a private standard-bearer of American democracy, entrepreneurialism, and technological progress. Far from being an aberrant mercenary, Gobat suggests, Walker marched in step with the idea of manifest destiny and the Monroe Doctrine, which, taken together, legitimized U.S. military intervention in the Caribbean. Walker’s escapades followed the U.S. occupation of Mexican territo- ries and the subsequent California gold rush and anticipated U.S. efforts in the twentieth century to project power in Latin America and around the globe. But his was not just a story of U.S. imperialism. One of the sides in Nicaragua’s civil war contracted with Walker and his mercenaries to advance their cause and in the hope that the United States would select their country to build a canal between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. In the event, Walker behaved miserably, wantonly razing the old colonial city of Granada. Meanwhile, the canal was eventually dug—in Panama. Gobat concludes that U.S. liberal imperialism represented an “extraordinary threat and promise . . . to peoples outside the United States.”"
61,"The Tango War: The Struggle for the Hearts, Minds, and Riches of Latin America During World War II",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2018-10-16/tango-war-struggle-hearts-minds-and-riches-latin-america-during,"The Tango War: The Struggle for the Hearts, Minds, and Riches of Latin America During World War II","During World War II, the United States urged Latin America to join the struggle. Washington aimed to deny Germany and Italy access to vital raw materials from the continent, disrupt fascist spy networks there, and protect transatlantic sea-lanes. The U.S. war machine relied on Mexican oil and Brazilian rubber; Mexicans replaced American farm workers diverted to military service; and a Brazilian expeditionary force fought bravely in the invasion of Italy. These facts have been well recorded elsewhere, but McConahay, a seasoned journalist, enriches her dramatic account of the period with sympathetic interviews of survivors whose lives were scarred by wartime disruptions. She reminds readers that U.S. behavior was not always noble. People of German and Japanese origin living in Latin America were kidnapped, shipped to remote prison camps in the United States, and sometimes bartered for American prisoners of war. And opportunistic U.S. firms seized market shares from their excluded Axis competitors. Distrustful of U.S. power, some Latin American countries leaned toward neutrality or even the Axis, but McConahay reveals the essential truth that, in a time of great peril, the United States and most of Latin America found common cause against a shared enemy."
62,Military Missions in Democratic Latin America,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2018-10-16/military-missions-democratic-latin-america,Military Missions in Democratic Latin America,"During the Cold War, Latin American generals often invoked the specter of national security to seize political power, enrich themselves, and violate human rights. That left the region’s governments distrustful of men in uniforms. But things have changed. Pion-Berlin persuasively argues that democratic regimes can now safely turn to their armed forces to perform important tasks, such as fighting criminal gangs, providing disaster relief, and expanding access to social programs, without compromising civilian control of the military. The decision to deploy soldiers, he writes, should be based on how bad the problem is, how much the military can do to help, and what alternative solutions are available. To mitigate the risks, governments need firm mechanisms to ensure civilian control. Pion-Berlin draws on careful case studies to present other caveats, as well. Mexico’s military operations against cartel kingpins were largely successful, but patrols in urban areas lacked adequate safeguards. And the large-scale social programs undertaken by Venezuela’s military lasted too long and had too little oversight, leading to corruption within the ranks and the politicization of the armed forces. But overall, well-structured military missions can strengthen popular support for democracy by demonstrating that democratic governments can deliver public goods."
63,Electoral Rules and Democracy in Latin America,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2018-10-16/electoral-rules-and-democracy-latin-america,Electoral Rules and Democracy in Latin America,"The durability of democracies can depend on the electoral rules they adopt. In this richly documented study, McClintock finds that democracies where presidential candidates need only a plurality of the vote to triumph are in serious danger of losing their popular legitimacy and eventually falling victim to tyranny. In support of her thesis, she highlights the democratic breakdowns of Nicaragua and Venezuela, both of which allow plurality winners. Aware of the risks, 75 percent of Latin American countries have adopted second-round runoffs between the top two contenders. Runoff systems are more likely to sustain popular support, McClintock finds, and also create more opportunities for third parties, thus injecting new blood into the political arena and avoiding the danger of spoilers. Turning to the United States, whose electoral rules she calls “anachronistic, sclerotic relics,” McClintock urges Americans to stop revering their constitution as a “quasi-biblical revelation” and learn from innovative Latin American democratic engineering."
64,Our Woman in Havana: A Diplomat’s Chronicle of America’s Long Struggle With Castro’s Cuba,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2018-10-16/our-woman-havana-diplomats-chronicle-americas-long-struggle,Our Woman in Havana: A Diplomat’s Chronicle of America’s Long Struggle With Castro’s Cuba,"This candid memoir features many revealing and entertaining anecdotes from Huddleston’s time as head of the U.S. mission in Havana, a position she held from 1999 to 2002. (Without an embassy of their own, U.S. diplomats used the Swiss one instead.) When Huddleston rst met Cuban President Fidel Castro, she introduced herself as “the director of Cuban a airs”; Castro boomed back, “Oh? I thought I was!” Huddleston also discusses the political pressures under which she operated. U.S. policy toward Cuba was driven largely by militant anti-Castro Cuban exiles in Miami, whose leadership Huddleston paints as vengeful and delusional. As a result, U.S. diplomats concentrated on connecting with dissident activists on the island, even though they did not pose “the slightest threat to Castro’s rule.” Later, in 2006, when Raúl Castro assumed power, the U.S. mission, still focusing on the wrong things, failed to fully brief Washington on Raúl’s reforms and the opportunities they presented for better relations. By the time the Obama administration engaged with Cuba, in late 2014, it was too late to make the new, warmer relationship politically irreversible—to the eventual delight of anti-Castro Cuban Americans in Miami and U.S. President Donald Trump, who has undone much of the progress Barack Obama made."
65,The Vanishing Nuclear Taboo?,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/world/2018-10-15/vanishing-nuclear-taboo,The Vanishing Nuclear Taboo?,"On April 5, 2009, U.S. President Barack Obama stood before a massive crowd in Prague and gave a soaring speech announcing his commitment to “a world without nuclear weapons.” In pursuit of that goal, he pledged to seek an arms reduction treaty with Russia, ratify the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT), and convene a global summit to discuss the eventual elimination of nuclear stockpiles. He acknowledged that a nuclear-free world was unlikely to be achieved in his lifetime, yet his speech marked the first time a U.S. president had set out a step-by-step agenda for abolishing nuclear arms. It represented a sharp break from the approach of U.S. President George W. Bush, who had expanded nuclear missions and rejected arms control. Much of the world was elated. Nuclear disarmament was back on the global agenda. That September, the UN Security Council unanimously adopted a resolution endorsing Obama’s vision and strengthening various disarmament and nonproliferation measures. The following month, the Nobel Committee awarded Obama the Nobel Peace Prize, citing his call for nuclear disarmament. More than six decades after humanity first harnessed the destructive power of nuclear reactions, the only country to have ever used nuclear weapons was charting a path for the world to put the genie back in the bottle."
66,Beijing’s Nuclear Option,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2018-10-15/beijings-nuclear-option,Beijing’s Nuclear Option,"As China’s power has grown in recent years, so, too, has the risk of war with the United States. Under President Xi Jinping, China has increased its political and economic pressure on Taiwan and built military installations on coral reefs in the South China Sea, fueling Washington’s fears that Chinese expansionism will threaten U.S. allies and influence in the region. U.S. destroyers have transited the Taiwan Strait, to loud protests from Beijing. American policymakers have wondered aloud whether they should send an aircraft carrier through the strait as well. Chinese fighter jets have intercepted U.S. aircraft in the skies above the South China Sea. Meanwhile, U.S. President Donald Trump has brought long-simmering economic disputes to a rolling boil."
67,Venezuela’s Suicide,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/south-america/venezuelas-suicide,Venezuela’s Suicide,"Consider two Latin American countries. The first is one of the region’s oldest and strongest democracies. It boasts a stronger social safety net than any of its neighbors and is making progress on its promise to deliver free health care and higher education to all its citizens. It is a model of social mobility and a magnet for immigrants from across Latin America and Europe. The press is free, and the political system is open; opposing parties compete fiercely in elections and regularly alternate power peacefully. It sidestepped the wave of military juntas that mired some Latin American countries in dictatorship. Thanks to a long political alliance and deep trade and investment ties with the United States, it serves as the Latin American headquarters for a slew of multinational corporations. It has the best infrastructure in South America. It is still unmistakably a developing country, with its share of corruption, injustice, and dysfunction, but it is well ahead of other poor countries by almost any measure."
68,Moscow’s Nuclear Enigma,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/russian-federation/2018-10-15/moscows-nuclear-enigma,Moscow’s Nuclear Enigma,"Talk to anybody in Washington (except, perhaps, the U.S. president), and you will hear an ominous mantra: the Russians are back. Moscow, resurgent, is sowing discord among Western states and trying to reestablish its sphere of influence in former Soviet countries and beyond. One development, in particular, has caused much hyperventilating in Western ministries and think tanks: the Russian Federation not only has more nuclear weapons than any other country in the world but also is investing in an arsenal of modern, low-yield nuclear weapons that could be used for limited nuclear warfare."
69,"If You Want Peace, Prepare for Nuclear War",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2018-10-15/if-you-want-peace-prepare-nuclear-war,"If You Want Peace, Prepare for Nuclear War","In a little under three decades, nuclear weapons have gone from center stage to a sideshow in U.S. defense strategy. Since the 1990s, the United States has drastically reduced its stockpile and concentrated on its conventional and irregular warfare capabilities. Nuclear weapons policy has focused overwhelmingly on stemming proliferation to countries such as Iran and North Korea, and prominent political and national security figures have even called for abolishing nuclear weapons altogether. What was once the core of the country’s Cold War strategy has been reduced to an afterthought."
70,The Next Arab Uprising,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/middle-east/2018-10-15/next-arab-uprising,The Next Arab Uprising,"Two perfect storms have struck the Arab world in the past decade. In 2011, in what was at first optimistically called “the Arab Spring,” popular uprisings unseated autocrats across the region. Hopes ran high that these peaceful protest movements would usher in a new era of democracy in the Middle East. But except in Tunisia, they ended in turmoil or deadly civil wars. Then, in 2014, the region’s leaders were dealt another blow when the price of oil plummeted, threatening the basic model of governance on which their power rested. Low oil prices since have made it difficult for regimes to fund bloated budgets, buy off elites, and hold up long-postponed reforms. This is not a temporary aberration: it is unlikely that the price of oil will ever again rise to its pre-2014 levels."
71,The Committee to Save the World Order,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/world/committee-save-world-order,The Committee to Save the World Order,"The order that has structured international politics since the end of World War II is fracturing. Many of the culprits are obvious. Revisionist powers, such as China and Russia, want to reshape global rules to their own advantage. Emerging powers, such as Brazil and India, embrace the perks of great-power status but shun the responsibilities that come with it. Rejectionist powers, such as Iran and North Korea, defy rules set by others. Meanwhile, international institutions, such as the UN, struggle to address problems that multiply faster than they can be resolved."
72,Health Without Wealth,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2018-09-26/health-without-wealth,Health Without Wealth,"For the first time in recorded history, bacteria, viruses, and other infectious agents do not cause the majority of deaths or disabilities in any region of the world. Since 2003, the number of people who die each year from HIV/AIDS has fallen by more than 40 percent. Deaths from malaria, tuberculosis, and diarrheal diseases have fallen by more than 25 percent each. In 1950, there were nearly 100 countries, including almost every one in sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia, where at least one out of five children died before his or her fifth birthday, most of them from infectious diseases. Today, there are none. The average life expectancy in developing countries has risen to 70."
73,The Crisis Next Time,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/united-states/crisis-next-time,The Crisis Next Time,"At the turn of this century, most economists in the developed world believed that major economic disasters were a thing of the past, or at least relegated to volatile emerging markets. Financial systems in rich countries, the thinking went, were too sophisticated to simply collapse. Markets were capable of regulating themselves. Policymakers had tamed the business cycle. Recessions would remain short, shallow, and rare."

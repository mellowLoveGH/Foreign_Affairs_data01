These well-informed political histories provide a fascinating view into the global reach of radical Islam. On the African continent, ISIS affiliates can be found in Algeria, Libya, and Tunisia in North Africa; Mali, Nigeria, and some of their West African neighbors; Somalia; and, to a lesser extent, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Mozambique. Although ISIS has been in decline in the Middle East in recent years, African militant groups still seek its imprimatur to gain greater legitimacy and to win potential financial support, even though such aid has rarely materialized. Formal ties between the affiliates and the core isis organization remain tenuous and only partially developed, but the book does suggest that the Internet has proved to be a remarkably effective way for these groups to influence one another, allowing them to share tactics and rhetoric—and to indulge in their predilection for filming gruesome acts of violence."
1,“We Are Not Scared to Die”: Julius Malema and the New Movement for African Liberation,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-12-14/we-are-not-scared-die-julius-malema-and-new-movement-african,“We Are Not Scared to Die”: Julius Malema and the New Movement for African Liberation,"The career of the South African politician Julius Malema has won much attention. Once a firebrand leader of the youth wing of the African National Congress, he has since built his own party and social movement, the Economic Freedom Fighters, as a left-wing populist alternative to the increasingly decrepit ANC. Copeland’s new book has the merit of being the first in at least a decade to discuss Malema’s ideas and approach to politics. Her account is avowedly positive. The book discusses several important episodes in Malema’s political life, such as his break with the ANC in 2012 and the electoral emergence of the EFF in 2014, when it sent 25 representatives to the South African Parliament. One chapter approvingly describes the EFF’s use of social media and humor. Malema has typically been described outside South Africa as an anti-white populist, with few policy ideas other than the expropriation of white farmers’ land and the nationalization of corporate holdings in the country. Copeland insists that Malema’s political rhetoric has to be understood as performative and humorous, and as a form of distinctly Black rhetoric, bred by the country’s history of racism and neglect of its majority Black population."
2,Empire and Jihad: The Anglo-Arab Wars of 1870–1920,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-12-14/empire-and-jihad-anglo-arab-wars-1870-1920,Empire and Jihad: The Anglo-Arab Wars of 1870–1920,"The history of British exploration of East Africa and southern Africa and the eventual British colonial conquest of Sudan has already been well covered in academic and popular works. But Faulkner does provide a new, comprehensive analysis of less familiar but still important military engagements in Egypt, Somalia, and Sudan. In addition, he reframes the history to show how the economic institution of slavery shaped the local response to European encroachment in the region. Faulkner claims that the predatory colonialism of the late nineteenth century pitted the “coolie capitalism of European empires”—how European powers hunted for new markets to help drag their domestic economies out of recession—against the local “slave systems of Middle Eastern potentates,” which relied on the substantial profits of the East African slave trade and fought back against British attempts to end it. The book is also highly readable, stuffed with sharp descriptions of key events and with vivid portrayals of the (mostly) men behind them."
3,Arbitrary States: Social Control and Modern Authoritarianism in Museveni’s Uganda,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-12-14/arbitrary-states-social-control-and-modern-authoritarianism,Arbitrary States: Social Control and Modern Authoritarianism in Museveni’s Uganda,"Recent studies of authoritarian states have emphasized the increasingly hybrid nature of such governments, which more and more eschew violence in favor of subtler forms of legal and institutional manipulation. Tapscott’s fine examination of the regime of Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni insists, nonetheless, that most authoritarian regimes remain reliant on the threat of violence. In her careful analysis of the country’s security sector, which encompasses the army, the police, and more or less sanctioned private local militias and vigilante groups, she notes that the regime has put in place a system of “institutionalized arbitrariness,” in which the inconsistent interventions of the state encourage citizens to seek out their own solutions to insecurity—only for the state to then intervene in a powerful but bludgeoning manner that often punishes the citizens. For instance, state officials encouraged a town to set up a local vigilante group to tamp down rising crime and violence, but then the police shot members of the group while on patrol. When the group complained, the state blamed it for growing insecurity. The resulting uncertainty over the state’s actual security policies makes it harder for citizens to organize against the state. Tapscott’s analysis strikingly underlines the truism that, in authoritarian states, the army and the police serve the regime, not the public."
4,Youth on the Move: Views From Below on Ethiopian International Migration,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-12-14/youth-move-views-below-ethiopian-international-migration,Youth on the Move: Views From Below on Ethiopian International Migration,"The contributors to this fine collection analyze three distinct networks of migration out of Ethiopia: one involving mostly women who seek employment as domestic workers in the Gulf countries, another of people who try to reach South Africa, and a third heading for Europe. Ethiopia’s international outmigration numbers are below average by African standards, but they still involve tens of thousands of individuals every year—a number that might grow in the wake of the ongoing civil war. Almost all these migrants are very young and travel without visas. The authors resist the standard mechanistic view of migration as resulting from “push and pull” economic factors and focus instead on the beliefs, attitudes, and social connections of the migrants themselves, as they embark on what are typically extremely perilous journeys with highly uncertain outcomes. What emerges from the various forms of hard data and ethnographic material gathered in this collection is a fascinating exploration of the process of migration, revealing the social networks that enable human trafficking, what the families left at home expect of the migrants, and the aspirations of the young migrants as they voyage into the world."
5,Flying Blind: Vietnam’s Decision to Join ASEAN,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-12-14/flying-blind-vietnams-decision-join-asean,Flying Blind: Vietnam’s Decision to Join ASEAN,"Nguyen provides a peek into communist Vietnam’s strategic deliberations regarding the Association of Southeast Asian Nations at the tail end of the Cold War. Using internal party documents and high-level interviews, Nguyen, a scholar and a diplomat, reveals the twists and turns leading to Hanoi’s decision to join ASEAN in 1995. Initially, Vietnamese leaders maintained a hostile policy toward the regional association, viewing it first as an organization that would advance U.S.-style anticommunism in the waning years of the United States’ war in Vietnam and later as a vehicle for China’s anti-Vietnam campaign following Vietnam’s invasion of Cambodia at the end of 1978 and the outbreak of the Sino-Vietnamese War in 1979. The ideological underpinnings of Vietnam’s foreign policy during these conflict-ridden times prevented policymakers from seeing ASEAN on its own terms. Peacetime changed Hanoi’s calculus. Vietnamese leaders began to understand ASEAN as a regional community that could support Hanoi’s bid for rapid economic development. Nguyen deftly guides his readers through Hanoi’s decision-making, turning once opaque dealings transparent."
6,Middle Class Shanghai: Reshaping U.S.-China Engagement,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-12-14/middle-class-shanghai-reshaping-us-china-engagement,Middle Class Shanghai: Reshaping U.S.-China Engagement,"Based on decades of original research, this book provides a nuanced counterpoint to alarmist caricatures of China and its citizens by exploring the diversity and dynamism of Shanghai and its large middle class. The city’s progressive outlook and eclectic culture stem from its history as a vital port town teeming with bankers, industrialists, architects, and missionaries from around the world. Its avant-garde political ferment gave birth to the revolutionary Chinese Communist Party in 1921. Present-day Shanghai is a cosmopolitan metropolis with the most skyscrapers, international banks, cafés, and art galleries in China. Surveys show that the city’s residents are significantly more concerned than the wider population about numerous political and environmental issues, including climate change, inequality, the plight of migrant workers, and government accountability. In China’s major cities, U.S.-trained professionals now hold leadership positions in academia, law, business, the creative arts, and even politics. Li makes the persuasive case that this middle class can help improve relations between China and the United States. He recommends a U.S. strategy of engagement with, rather than decoupling from, China, one that is sensitive to these dynamics and works toward pursuing shared goals."
7,Colonial Institutions and Civil War: Indirect Rule and Maoist Insurgency in India,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-12-14/colonial-institutions-and-civil-war-indirect-rule-and-maoist,Colonial Institutions and Civil War: Indirect Rule and Maoist Insurgency in India,"The Maoist, or Naxalite, insurgency has flared up and cooled down several times over the past half century in scattered districts of eastern India. Its geographic pattern is difficult to explain solely with conventional theories that focus on the distribution of economic and ethnic grievances and topographical remoteness. Mukherjee shows that the insurgency has flourished in districts where the British colonists ruled through traditional princes or the local landlord caste instead of with their own bureaucracy. Exploitation under indirect rule was harsher and the policing system weaker than under direct rule. This left behind deep inequality, discrimination against subordinate castes and tribes, thin infrastructure, and understaffed administrative institutions—all favorable conditions for the revolutionaries to recruit support when they launched their movement in the late 1960s. Mukherjee’s analysis promises to enrich the understanding of how historical legacies shape civil conflicts."
8,Democracy and Nationalism in Southeast Asia: From Secessionist Mobilization to Conflict Resolution,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-12-14/democracy-and-nationalism-southeast-asia-secessionist,Democracy and Nationalism in Southeast Asia: From Secessionist Mobilization to Conflict Resolution,"Do transitions to democracy inflame or calm ethnonationalist movements that took shape under authoritarian regimes? Bertrand draws together years of research into five such movements in Southeast Asia to show that violence tends to surge right after the democratic transition, when separatists see an opportunity to achieve their goals. If the new democratic elites offer plausible concessions, however, the conflict has a good chance at least of being diminished, if not resolved. In Indonesia in 2006, for example, the post-transition government offered the province of Aceh a strong form of local autonomy, which addressed many of the demands issued by a pro-independence movement there and greatly reduced violence. By contrast, Thai politicians during the democratic period in the 1990s and early years of the next decade refused to negotiate with Malay Muslims in the south, allowing a low-level insurgency to continue there. The three other case studies lie between these extremes. Violence in the Cordillera highlands of the Philippines abated after 1997, when the government granted local groups special status as indigenous peoples. Meanwhile, however, the Moro uprising in the same country kept flaring up because the government failed to implement its agreements. In Papua, the inconsistent implementation of a 2001 special autonomy law kept a resistance going. It is hard for any kind of regime to compromise on national unity, but Bertrand shows that negotiation is a better way to manage separatist challenges than repression."
9,Rethinking Chinese Politics,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-12-14/rethinking-chinese-politics,Rethinking Chinese Politics,"Fewsmith offers a spirited rebuttal of the conventional view that China’s post-Mao regime has avoided power struggles and maintained control by creating institutionalized rules for policymaking, policy implementation, and leadership succession. He deploys a deep knowledge of elite political networks and party organizational dynamics to reconstruct what must have happened behind the scenes as the Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping and his successors maneuvered to consolidate and exercise power, sometimes following rules but just as often twisting, replacing, or violating them. The stately façade of Chinese politics conceals the “personalization of power, factionalism, . . . [the] arbitrary abuse of power, corruption, and . . . [a] lack of discipline.” Fierce rivalries and wily maneuvers have left some leaders weakened and have concentrated too much power in the hands of President Xi Jinping. Fewsmith implies that a system saddled with this much “corrosion and dysfunction” will sooner or later decay, but he does not forecast when or how."
10,When People Want Punishment: Retributive Justice and the Puzzle of Authoritarian Popularity,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-12-14/when-people-want-punishment-retributive-justice-and-puzzle,When People Want Punishment: Retributive Justice and the Puzzle of Authoritarian Popularity,"Many students of China have analyzed the sources of popular support for the authoritarian regime in Beijing. To the usual list of causes—economic performance, propaganda, nationalism, and culture—Tsai adds a new explanation: anticorruption campaigns, she argues, buttress the regime’s popularity because people want to see the enemies of the social order punished. The theory is attractive, even if her data leave some ambiguity about whether the wish for punishment is driven by a moral conviction or just a pragmatic preference for good government. Beyond China, she shows that authoritarian movements everywhere feed on the promise to punish perceived enemies of the social good. One wishes Tsai had compared the weight of this moral outrage with other factors that previous scholars have linked to regime support. And some readers will wonder whether a regime can get just as much public approval by promising to punish external enemies as it gets from targeting domestic malefactors."
11,A Region of Regimes: Prosperity and Plunder in the Asia-Pacific,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-12-14/region-regimes-prosperity-and-plunder-asia-pacific,A Region of Regimes: Prosperity and Plunder in the Asia-Pacific,"Pempel comprehensively analyzes the growth strategies of ten economies during the Asian economic miracle that started in the 1960s. Four patterns emerge. “Developmental regimes” that had competent bureaucracies, homogeneous societies, and U.S. support, such as Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan, were able to build advanced modern economies, although their growth rates declined in the 1990s due to U.S. trade restrictions and growing domestic political contention. “Ersatz developmental regimes,” such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand, also enjoyed substantial growth, based mostly on their exploitation of labor, land, and natural resources. But they suffered from weaker bureaucracies and more divided societies and did not develop advanced economies. Even the “rapacious regimes”—Myanmar, North Korea, and the Philippines—had occasional growth spurts, but they never developed competent state institutions or skilled workforces. China combined elements of all three types: deep industrialization, cheap labor, and authoritarian institutions. Relations among these places—and between each of them and the United States—played an important role in fostering growth for all but Myanmar and North Korea. The regional stability on which they have relied, however, is now threatened by the U.S.-Chinese rivalry."
12,Bread and Freedom: Egypt’s Revolutionary Situation,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-12-14/bread-and-freedom-egypts-revolutionary-situation,Bread and Freedom: Egypt’s Revolutionary Situation,"With an unusual command of detail and an uncommon facility with social science theory, El-Ghobashy recounts the years of upheaval in Egypt between the 2011 uprising against President Hosni Mubarak and the 2014 election of Abdel Fattah el-Sisi. She argues against the twin temptations to uncover a definitive cause of the turmoil and to predict an obvious outcome. Instead, El-Ghobashy stresses the uncertainty of those years—the “revolutionary situation” of her subtitle—and insists on examining the “struggle to rearrange power within the state” as it happened. She analyzes protests, elections, and, perhaps most surprising, the courts as mechanisms of political contestation, emphasizing the volatility of collective action and the contingency of alliances. During those years, Egyptians of all persuasions resorted to litigation, and judges affirmed, struck down, rejected, and restored constitutional provisions, legislative rules, and government decrees with ingenuity and authority. As El-Ghobashy elegantly shows, it is small wonder that the politics of those years seemed so confusing and uncertain. They were, for actors and observers alike—and she provides much welcome clarity."
13,"The Middle East Crisis Factory: Tyranny, Resilience, and Resistance",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/middle-east-crisis-factory-tyranny-resilience-and-resistance,"The Middle East Crisis Factory: Tyranny, Resilience, and Resistance","This book by two self-described activists—a stateless Palestinian now based in Oslo and a British Libyan citizen—is an effort “to get through to the average Westerner” and insist on a more complicated story of the Middle East. The authors are frustrated by analyses that attribute the region’s myriad problems to single causes—despotism, say, or Western intervention—and seek solutions in simple remedies, such as elections or, indeed, Western intervention. Decades of broken promises from post-independence governments laid the groundwork for the Middle East to be dominated by tyranny, terrorism, and foreign influence, forces that reinforce and perpetuate one another. In the authors’ telling, the 2011 uprisings in Egypt, Iraq, and Syria and the later rebellions in Algeria, Lebanon, the Palestinian territories, and Sudan were attempts to break this triangular stranglehold. They argue that the counterrevolutionary efforts by local autocrats and their international supporters, however formidable they seem now, will ultimately prove fruitless. Like many activists, they are congenital optimists, but they are also clear-eyed about the obstacles. The book’s scholarly references are untidy, and its casual tone is sometimes jarringly conversational; in discussing their recommendations at one point, the authors ask, “Are we for real?” But this informality may beguile the wider audience to which the book is addressed."
14,"The Daughters of Kobani: A Story of Rebellion, Courage, and Justice",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-12-14/daughters-kobani-story-rebellion-courage-and-justice,"The Daughters of Kobani: A Story of Rebellion, Courage, and Justice","An admiring, almost fawning portrait of women who fought to free Kurdish towns in northern Syria from the control of the so-called Islamic State, or ISIS, in the late 2010s, this book is a useful illustration of the ideological influence of the Kurdish leader Abdullah Ocalan, the founder of the militant Kurdistan Workers’ Party and a longtime political prisoner in Turkey. It is organized around the biographies of four Syrian Kurdish women as they grow from unruly teenagers into mature, seasoned, and effective military commanders who were instrumental in the liberation not only of the northern city of Kobani but also of Raqqa and other ISIS-controlled areas in Syria. The stories of unseen snipers, booby-trapped buildings, nighttime river crossings—and, more deeply, of self-doubt and heroism—are well crafted. In portraying these women, Lemmon chooses not to delve deeply into the role of Kurdish nationalism, with its strains of utopian socialism and feminism. Instead, she thinks these fighters, in their eagerness to take on roles typically forbidden to women, are simply mounting a rebellion against the strictures of patriarchal family life. Like the female guerillas of Colombia’s FARC (Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia), however, these women are fighting for a cause, and, like their Colombian sisters, they are likely to find it hard to demobilize."
15,Queer Palestine and the Empire of Critique,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-12-14/queer-palestine-and-empire-critique,Queer Palestine and the Empire of Critique,"This taxing but ultimately rewarding book offers an impressive treatment of the complex challenges that Palestinian LGBTQ activists face. In a tone both knowledgeable and modest, Atshan describes how the gay rights movement must negotiate constant censure and faultfinding—an “empire of critique.” Palestinian activists must juggle the competing demands of advocating gay rights, anti-imperialism, and Palestinian liberation, finding themselves disparaged as insufficiently committed to one or the other cause. Some critics argue that expressing international LGBTQ solidarity is tantamount to complicity in imperialism, or they link Palestinian nationalism to the tolerance of homophobia. This social movement is certainly not the first to grapple with divides over strategy and tactics or to founder in the “radical purism” of academic disputes, but few books so eloquently describe the human costs of these struggles and, in so doing, suggest the often overlooked power of honesty and generosity in politics. Atshan’s work is candid, self-critical, and unexpectedly inspiring."
16,A Short History of Islamic Thought,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-12-14/short-history-islamic-thought,A Short History of Islamic Thought,"The history of Islamic thought is a well-told tale, by both Muslim and Western scholars. This brief book thus offers little new. But it is a more than serviceable introduction for English-speaking readers who want to learn about (or need a refresher on) a wide variety of subjects, including the historical antecedents of the modern-day Salafists, the significance of the medieval Islamic scholar Ibn Tay-miyyah, the origins of the Wahhabis, and the basis of the concept of velayat-e faqih (rule by the jurisprudent), which the Iranian revolutionary Ruhollah Khomeini used to justify the clergy’s seizure of political power in Iran. Morrissey obviously enjoys the history of ideas—in his words, Islamic thought is an “intrinsically fascinating” subject—including recondite debates about the nature of God or the relationship between reason and revelation. Many knowledgeable readers will quibble with an occasional emphasis or interpretation, but on the whole, Morrissey does a good job tracing this diverse canon in clear, genial prose."
17,Assignment Russia: Becoming a Foreign Correspondent in the Crucible of the Cold War,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-12-14/assignment-russia-becoming-foreign-correspondent-crucible-cold,Assignment Russia: Becoming a Foreign Correspondent in the Crucible of the Cold War,"In this engaging memoir, Kalb, the renowned American journalist, begins by recalling the youthful advantages that spurred his career: his intellectual gifts, Harvard education, insatiable curiosity about the world, and unflagging energy. His talents were quickly recognized by some of the major figures of American journalism, first and foremost by the legendary Edward R. Murrow. Starting out in 1958 as a news writer for a local CBS radio station, Kalb quickly reached the “pinnacle of [his] professional aspirations” in 1960, when he became CBS News’ Moscow correspondent. For his first assignment in that capacity, Kalb was sent to cover the Paris summit that year, where the Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev was supposed to discuss the postwar situation in Berlin with his British, French, and U.S. counterparts. The summit failed before it started, but Kalb managed to get an exclusive interview with Khrushchev and even to treat him to a freshly baked croissant. Kalb shares what he thought at the time about some major historical developments, such as the early cracks in the Sino-Soviet alliance, as well as his experience with the Soviet bureaucracy. In one episode, hotel officials repeatedly denied Kalb’s request for a larger bed: the six-foot, three-inch journalist had to make do with a bed that was only five feet, ten inches long. In the end, he had his own bed airmailed to Moscow from New Jersey."
18,Collapse: The Fall of the Soviet Union,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/collapse-fall-soviet-union,Collapse: The Fall of the Soviet Union,"Zubok’s meticulous chronicle covering the years of Mikhail Gorbachev’s reforms in the 1980s and early 1990s passes exceptionally harsh judgment on the last Soviet leader. He lauds Gorbachev’s vision of global affairs but does not hold back when it comes to criticism: Gorbachev had a poor understanding of the Soviet economy and launched ill-conceived economic reforms. Zubok condemns Gorbachev for radically weakening the Communist Party apparatus, the Soviet Union’s only effective governing mechanism, which eventually left him to powerlessly watch his country’s demise. The book offers an impressive close-up of the hectic political and diplomatic activities between August 1991, the time of the failed Communist coup, and December of that year, when the Soviet Union formally ceased to exist. Throughout, one is struck by the grand expectations that Gorbachev, his allies, and his opponents had of the West, and the United States in particular, as a source of political support, legitimation, and, especially, economic assistance. But as Washington watched its Cold War adversary plunge into a meltdown, it was no longer willing to keep extending credit to the Soviet Union and began focusing instead on protecting itself from the consequences of the Soviet Union’s collapse."
19,The Horde: How the Mongols Changed the World,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-12-14/horde-how-mongols-changed-world,The Horde: How the Mongols Changed the World,"Favereau’s history of the Horde, a nomadic regime that grew out of the Mongol leader Genghis Khan’s expansion of his empire in the early thirteenth century and lasted for over two centuries, relies on abundant academic literature and translated primary sources. The Horde controlled a gigantic territory that extended from Central Asia to eastern Europe and included Russian principalities and Siberia. It excelled at conquest, trade, co-opting local elites, and collecting tribute but was weak in written culture and architecture. Favereau’s narrative is extremely rich in ethnographic detail and descriptions of succession battles, military campaigns, and internecine warfare. Favereau seeks to exonerate the Horde, which in her view is too often portrayed as merely a plundering force. To that end, she focuses on the Horde’s impact on the course of history, particularly the history of Russia. Subordination to the Horde, Favereau argues, was beneficial for Russia, which at the time was fragmented, mostly rural, and agriculturally poor. The Mongols, according to Favereau, “created for the Russians a type of governance befitting their political and economic particularities and cultural sensitivities.” This interpretation sounds strangely colonial and stands in sharp contrast to the Russian perception of the Horde’s domination: Russians refer to it as “the Tatar-Mongol yoke” and see this unique episode of long-term vassalage as a time of humiliation, destruction, and decline."
20,The Soviet Myth of World War II: Patriotic Memory and the Russian Question in the USSR,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-12-14/soviet-myth-world-war-ii-patriotic-memory-and-russian-question,The Soviet Myth of World War II: Patriotic Memory and the Russian Question in the USSR,"According to Brunstedt’s thoroughly researched book, the Soviet understanding of World War II, which Russians call “the Great Patriotic War,” consisted of two competing narratives. One story was “Russocentric,” emphasizing the leading role of the Russian people in the ethnically diverse Soviet Union and the legacy of pre-revolutionary Russia’s military prowess through the centuries. The other was “pan-Soviet” or internationalist, glorying in the supranational Soviet community and framing the victory over Nazi Germany as a triumph of the communist Soviet system. Brunstedt describes the uneasy balancing act attempted by consecutive Soviet governments of remembering the victory as an event with a “uniquely Soviet provenance” without fully abandoning the Russocentric view of the war as the specific triumph of the Russian people. Joseph Stalin promoted strongly Russocentric views of the war, but even in his tenure, pan-Soviet conceptions of victory gained greater currency, thanks in large part to concerns about provoking anti-Soviet Russian nationalism. Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev’s de-Stalinization campaign and his introduction of the doctrine of the Soviet people as a “new historical community” worked to suppress Russocentric imagery, or at least to dissociate it from the victory. Under Khrushchev’s successor, Leonid Brezhnev, the effective expansion of a purely pan-Soviet war cult was accompanied by the rise of Russian nationalism among high-ranking Communist Party functionaries and the literary elite."
21,"Navalny: Putin’s Nemesis, Russia’s Future?",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-12-14/navalny-putins-nemesis-russias-future,"Navalny: Putin’s Nemesis, Russia’s Future?","Alexei Navalny, Russian President Vladimir Putin’s chief political opponent, gained global recognition after he was poisoned in 2020. He returned to Russia after convalescing in Germany and was promptly arrested, instantly becoming Russia’s most prominent political prisoner. This is the first English-language book about Navalny, following his journey from an anticorruption activist to a street protest organizer to an anti-Kremlin politician. The authors describe Navalny as Russia’s “second most important politician,” a man of courage, creativity, and wit, endowed with a natural political talent and a knack for modern communications (“He is who he is because of the Internet,” they write). But they admit that his popularity is limited outside his core constituency of younger Russians and those who don’t support Putin. The book weaves Navalny’s story with sharp insights into the nature of Russia’s authoritarian regime. For curious readers who don’t know much about Russia, this book does a sterling job of explaining how corruption secures Putin’s rule instead of eroding it, why support for Putin still remains broad (most Russians are wary of change and see Putin as a guarantor of stability), and why, according to the authors, Navalny’s current imprisonment marks a perilous step for Russia toward full-fledged dictatorship."
22,Venezuela’s Authoritarian Allies: The Ties That Bind?,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/venezuelas-authoritarian-allies-ties-bind,Venezuela’s Authoritarian Allies: The Ties That Bind?,"This edited collection explores the complex set of connections between Venezuela and an array of supportive countries, relations that deserve the nuanced analysis of Arnson and her stellar list of contributors. Although Cuba remains a steadfast ally of the regime of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, other erstwhile backers are having their doubts. China has expressed frustration at Venezuela’s economic dysfunction. Russia has pulled back a bit, notably withdrawing the oil company Rosneft from Venezuela in 2020. The scope of the collection is impressive; other chapters focus on India, Iran, and Turkey. But this range will also make readers wonder just how similar these country-specific cases actually are. Do countries such as India and Turkey really belong in the same framework as Cuba? Cuba demonstrates loyalty through the sustained deepening of core security ties, but Indian and Turkish relations with Venezuela are more restricted and episodic. Ties with Turkey depend much on the personal rapport between Maduro and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. And with strategic ties between India and the United States growing closer, the space for cooperation between New Delhi and Caracas is narrowing."

In response, Facebook has put in place an independent review mechanism for its content moderation decisions, a body known as the Oversight Board. Lanza and Jackson report that in many of its initial opinions, the board felt Facebook was overzealous in deleting posts and recommended restoring many of them. The authors also usefully review three decisions involving Latin America: two from Brazil and one from Colombia that had to do with nudity, measures to contain COVID-19, and insults of political leaders. Lanza and Jackson prioritize freedom of expression; they denounce Internet censorship by overtly authoritarian regimes (such as those in Cuba, Nicaragua, and Venezuela) and express alarm at pending intrusive legislation elsewhere in Latin America judged to potentially violate due process. The authors urge the board to pay more attention to Latin American legal codes and civil society experts. Missing from this legalistic note is a sense of political urgency: that societies confront tough tradeoffs between free speech and social harm and that if not better moderated, by some combination of public and private regulations, social media may threaten democracy itself."
24,Stories That Make History: Mexico Through Elena Poniatowska’s Crónicas,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-12-14/stories-make-history-mexico-through-elena-poniatowskas-cronicas,Stories That Make History: Mexico Through Elena Poniatowska’s Crónicas,"Through her powerful crónicas—long-form works of narrative journalism featuring emotive oral accounts of major historical events—the 89-year-old Elena Poniatowska has crafted a stark vision of Mexico that pits a corrupt, inept political elite against a long-suffering repressed majority. Stephen, an anthropologist, assesses Poniatowska’s vibrant retelling of the tragic 1968 massacre in Mexico City of protesting students (in the form of a book that sold half a million copies), the heroic relief efforts of civil society groups that responded spontaneously to the devastating 1985 earthquake in Mexico City, the dramatic 1994 Zapatista indigenous uprising, the 2006 mass sit-in protesting alleged electoral fraud, and the mysterious disappearance in 2014 of 43 students from the town of Ayotzinapa. Stephen enriches each chapter with extensive interviews with Poniatowska (whom she describes as a good friend) and the writer’s close associates. As a highly visible public intellectual, Poniatowska hasn’t shied away from mixing journalism with political activism, most recently by ardently campaigning for Mexico’s populist president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador. Setting aside the skepticism characteristic of postmodern social science, Stephen wholeheartedly embraces Poniatowska’s engaged and immersive style of reporting and its contributions to building a “strategic emotional political community” of social justice advocates who identify with the victims of Mexican history."
25,Two Policy Reports on Central American Migration to the United States,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-12-14/two-policy-reports-central-american-migration-united-states,Two Policy Reports on Central American Migration to the United States,"Two policy reports probe the reasons why so many people leave Central America to come to the United States. Both advance reasonably well-integrated economic models of development grounded in recent history. Both propose comprehensive reforms; each package is reasonable in isolation but utterly daunting when considered in combination. The World Bank study dismisses the common notion that development in Central America has failed; rather, for nearly three decades, annual economic growth rates have averaged over 4.5 percent in the region, exports have expanded robustly, per capita incomes have risen, and poverty has fallen. But future growth will depend on confronting formidable challenges in those areas in which the region lags significantly behind: the quality of education and the productivity of labor; the infrastructure for transportation, power, and digital connectivity; the transparency and efficiency of public institutions and regulatory regimes; and, in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras, the ability to bring down the high rates of violent crime. Addressing these shortcomings should help attract foreign investment and multinationals looking to shorten supply chain lead times. Powerful global value chains can upgrade the sophistication of the region’s exported goods (apparel, medical devices, auto parts) and services (outsourced business processes, call centers, tourism) and add value to traditional agricultural exports. Pragmatic public-private collaborations can help businesses raise labor productivity and create well-paying jobs. The report warns, however, that achieving these goals “demands a strong strategic vision, policy coordination and building state capacities.”"
26,Waterloo Sunrise: London From the Sixties to Thatcher,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-12-14/waterloo-sunrise-london-sixties-thatcher,Waterloo Sunrise: London From the Sixties to Thatcher,"In this book, a leading urban historian argues that London pioneered the changes, good and bad, that have transformed all world cities over the past half century. In 1960, a fine restaurant shocked the city by admitting a single male diner without a tie. Just a few years later, multicolored male clothing, the Beatles and the Rolling Stones, and loose sexual mores made London “the most swinging city in the world”—a place seemingly without any remaining social rules. Classic urban problems followed. Smog and water pollution spread. Concrete highways, sterile housing blocks, and Brutalist office buildings sparked a preservationist reaction—but too late to save much more than Piccadilly Circus and Covent Garden. New immigrants and their British-born offspring vented frustration and anger at their exclusion and discrimination. Hordes of tourists, many of them young, flooded into town. The decline of traditional industry blighted neighborhoods and weakened the established strongholds of the Labour Party. Eventually, an alliance of conservative small-business owners and suburban homeowners began to vote for the Conservative Party, ushering in the era of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher."
27,Principles and Agents: The British Slave Trade and Its Abolition,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-12-14/principles-and-agents-british-slave-trade-and-its-abolition,Principles and Agents: The British Slave Trade and Its Abolition,"Powered by mass demand for West Indian sugar, the immense profitability of transporting slaves, and the dominance of the Royal Navy, the United Kingdom became the leading slave trader of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. The British government exploited such trade to cement its dominance over its imperial rival Holland, and traders in British cities such as Liverpool reinvested their gains to fuel the Industrial Revolution. Despite the lucrative benefits of slavery, Parliament abolished slave trading in 1807 and slavery itself three decades later. Some historians attribute these reforms to the declining profitability of colonial sugar production and shifts in the economics of empire induced by the American Revolution. Others stress a powerful abolitionist movement led by members of dissenting religious denominations, who pioneered modern mass mobilization techniques still employed by activist and advocacy groups today. Richardson points instead to the high costs of sending British troops to suppress slave revolts in the West Indies and the desire of British strategic planners to shift their attention and British resources to cementing mercantilist and strategic advantages over other European colonial powers."

Yet under President Richard Nixon and his adviser Henry Kissinger, Washington began to view European economic and security cooperation as a threat—one Nixon characterized as “a Frankenstein monster.” Although this book does not break new historiographic ground, it summarizes this epochal shift well, arguing that the central problem lay in divergent national interests. With a monetary crisis weakening the Bretton Woods system and a geopolitical debacle in Vietnam, the United States came to believe that the Europeans should spend more on defense, reduce their agricultural protections, accept the devaluation of the U.S. dollar, and abstain from criticism of American global priorities and actions. If Europe refused, Kissinger reasoned, the United States should seek to keep it divided. Understandably, the Europeans viewed such demands as misguided and unreasonable—and some began to question whether the United States was a reliable ally. The U.S. government has never returned to its full support for Europe, Larres argues, although he surely overreaches in treating the state of transatlantic relations under former President Donald Trump as a natural continuation of Nixon’s policies."

Now a professor of political philosophy at the London School of Economics, she recalls her early youth in that hermetically sealed tyranny, when she embraced the cult of personality established by the country’s idiosyncratic despot, Enver Hoxha. It was a place where all truths were lies, including the Muslim heritage and secret anticommunist history of her own family—yet for an 11-year-old, the country was safe and reassuring. She was disappointed and displaced by the fall of communism, only to have her hopes dashed again when, as in so many postcommunist states, liberal parties advocating free markets and democratic politics allowed their ideals to be corrupted by the kleptocratic temptations of privatization. The government encouraged citizens to invest in a pyramid scheme, triggering a revolt and eventually a civil war—a process in which her family, along with many others, lost everything. After years of disorientation, she left the country and began the long path to her current position. Drawing philosophical lessons from her experience, she dismisses both socialists who cling to utopian ideals and libertarians who espouse a minimal state, opting for a more moderate commitment to social democracy."
30,Wildland: The Making of America’s Fury,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-12-14/wildland-making-americas-fury,Wildland: The Making of America’s Fury,"Osnos returned from a decade living abroad to find a drastically altered United States, whose core values—the rule of law, truth, the right and the ability to pursue a better life—appeared to be under siege. His research into what has changed and why, told principally through the stories of individuals, stretched over seven years. The resulting book captures the widening inequalities of wealth and opportunity and the hardening of class lines that Donald Trump exploited. Others have recognized these same trends, but no one has told the story with more immediacy and impact. Osnos has an eye for the telling statistic and can make questions of policy come vividly alive. Osnos visits Clarksburg, West Virginia, and Chicago to paint the lives of the country’s poor. But his portrait of the transformation of “the Golden Triangle” of Greenwich, Connecticut, where he grew up, is the book’s high point. The town’s most influential residents were once wealthy, moderate Republicans, of the likes of the Bush family patriarch Prescott Bush, who were imbued with a strong sense of civic duty and a belief in government. Osnos finds Greenwich now inhabited by flamboyant hedge fund billionaires and private equity financiers building ever-larger mansions. These blinkered folks are libertarians who oppose taxes and regulations of any kind; they fervently believe that all they have achieved is their own doing, and they see little role for government in their lives or their communities."
31,American Exceptionalism: A New History of an Old Idea,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-12-14/american-exceptionalism-new-history-old-idea,American Exceptionalism: A New History of an Old Idea,"Tyrrell, a distinguished Australian historian, has written a rich intellectual history of the dramatic shifts in the meaning of the defining but, it turns out, highly malleable idea of “American exceptionalism,” from its roots in the revolutionary era to the present. Tracing the term’s changing significance illuminates U.S. history more broadly. At times, this exceptionalism’s principal substance has been political; at other times, religious; and at yet other times (although this has been poorly appreciated), it has rested primarily on the country’s material abundance, whether of its rich natural endowment or its bountiful consumer society. Often, American exceptionalism seemed to denote only that the United States was uniquely great in its wealth and power. But in the beginning, when the fledgling country was neither wealthy nor powerful, exceptionalism was nonetheless a strongly held “loose and grassroots feeling” that the new country was a major political innovation, destined to be a model for others. After numerous manifestations in the intervening years, American exceptionalism has emerged in the past dozen years as a “state-sponsored ideology,” a full-throated “ism” seen in some quarters as an accurate litmus test of patriotism. Closely related but distinct concepts, including “the American way of life” (framing American identity in opposition to communism), “the American dream” (the opportunity for all people to achieve everything their ability and ambition allow), and “the American creed” (capturing the political values of individualism and egalitarianism), provide additional insights. A tough closing chapter examines the often gaping differences between the beliefs Americans hold regarding their country’s exceptionalism and the realities of life in the United States and American conduct abroad."
32,The Strategy of Denial: American Defense in an Age of Great Power Conflict,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-12-14/strategy-denial-american-defense-age-great-power-conflict,The Strategy of Denial: American Defense in an Age of Great Power Conflict,"U.S.-Chinese relations have deteriorated to the point where official exchanges have become little more than destructive exercises in name-calling. Public hostility toward the other in both countries is higher than it has been for decades. China’s military moves in the South China Sea, its rapid qualitative and quantitative advances in weaponry, and its escalating invasions of Taiwanese airspace have made a U.S.-Chinese war over Taiwan alarmingly possible. In this climate, Colby’s step-by-step explication of a U.S. strategy that would deny China success in such a war is a welcome contribution. Washington can deny Beijing success, he argues, by recruiting an “anti-hegemonic coalition” in the region whose combined power would be sufficient to defeat China. Although detailed on some points, the proposed strategy rests on some major unexamined and highly questionable assumptions: that China is set on achieving regional hegemony in the short term and global predominance in the long term, that military preparations and eventual war are the best or only way for the United States to respond to China’s ambitions, that countries in the region that have made absolutely clear their determination not to choose between allegiance to China and allegiance to the United States would nonetheless be willing to join a coalition predicated on military confrontation with China, and that a major war over Taiwan would stay confined to Taiwan. These and other wobbly conjectures fatally undermine the argument."
33,Diplomacy and the Future of World Order,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/diplomacy-and-future-world-order,Diplomacy and the Future of World Order,"This collection offers a valuable review of the successes, failures, and potential of international peacemaking and conflict management in the still unnamed post–post–Cold War era. Chapters take both a regional and a functional approach to examine the various ways that states, multinational organizations, and civil society groups manage other people’s conflicts in places as disparate as Cyprus and Kashmir, address actual or potential conflicts among major powers in states such as North Korea and Ukraine, and cope with transnational threats such as piracy and terrorism. The conflict management mechanisms discussed include conventional bilateral diplomacy, multinational negotiations, public diplomacy, sanctions, mediation, formal peacekeeping, and, pivotally, the threat or actual use of force. The chapters on the role of international organizations, particularly the United Nations, and on U.S.-Chinese relations are particularly strong. On balance, the editors conclude that the space for international peacemaking and conflict management is shrinking due to resurgent nationalism, a “sovereign backlash” against earlier multinational interventions, and the diminished willingness of the major powers to undertake peacemaking missions. On the other hand, regional organizations and local and international civil society groups can be more active and more effective than in the past."

She begins with a riveting memoir of her childhood in northern England in a family and community plunged into poverty by the shutdown of her hometown’s coal mines. She escaped by excelling in school and grasping every snippet of opportunity that came her way, eventually building a career in the United States as a Russia expert. The story is told without the smallest whiff of victimhood about the barriers of class and gender she encountered. The book also offers a compelling analysis, based on her experience living in Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States, of the conditions that breed populism. She finds striking similarities among the trajectories of Russia after the collapse of the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom from the rule of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher to the Brexit referendum in 2016, and the United States, with its spiraling inequality and loss of opportunity, in the years leading up to Donald Trump’s presidency. In all three, “the infrastructure of opportunity” disappeared, producing the growing anger and cultural despair that create an appetite for authoritarian leadership. Finally, Hill recounts her time serving on Trump’s National Security Council. This is not a kiss-and-tell account, but what she does relate of her interactions with the president is in every case worth telling, as is her insight that Trump’s fragile ego made him a national security risk, vulnerable to the flattery of any foreign leader. The political extremism that continues to grow in the United States in the aftermath of Trump’s 2020 electoral defeat could, Hill fears, make his years in office “seem like a preface, rather than a postscript” to the country’s “democratic demise.”"
35,The Economic Weapon: The Rise of Sanctions as a Tool of Modern War,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-12-14/economic-weapon-rise-sanctions-tool-modern-war,The Economic Weapon: The Rise of Sanctions as a Tool of Modern War,"For those who see economic sanctions as a relatively mild way of expressing displeasure at a country’s behavior, this book, charting how they first emerged as a potential coercive instrument during the first decades of the twentieth century, will come as something of a revelation. In an original and persuasive analysis, Mulder shows how isolating aggressors from global commerce and finance was seen as an alternative to war that worked precisely because of the pain it imposed on the target society. From the very beginning, it was civilians who suffered the most. Nevertheless, the League of Nations embraced sanctions and established an elaborate legal and bureaucratic apparatus to enforce them. Mulder argues that instead of keeping the peace, this form of economic warfare aggravated the tensions of the 1930s, encouraging austerity and autarky and restraining smaller states but backfiring against the larger authoritarian ones, such as Italy."
36,Empire of Destruction: A History of Nazi Mass Killing,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-12-14/empire-destruction-history-nazi-mass-killing,Empire of Destruction: A History of Nazi Mass Killing,"In this meticulous, vivid, and grim accounting of the deliberate murder of civilians by Nazi Germany, Kay manages to keep a balance between careful analysis of the evidence and reminders of the horrors of the events he is describing, including individuals’ harrowing recollections of surviving by hiding among dead bodies—often those of their own relatives. The attempt to eliminate the Jewish people stands out because of its scale and animating ideology, but Kay shows how that was only the most extreme manifestation of a wider horror that depended on the dehumanization of victims and the perfection of the means of extermination. In calculating how many people the Nazis killed, he reaches a figure of 13 million during the war years alone, most of whom were murdered through starvation, shooting, or gassing. In addition to the Holocaust against the Jews, Kay describes the Nazi campaigns against people with mental and physical disabilities, the Polish elite and the occupants of Warsaw, the Roma, civilians in Soviet cities, and others unlucky enough to live in Nazi-occupied territory. This was an unparalleled exercise in collective violence, with “hundreds of thousands of mass murderers at large simultaneously.” Kay eschews monocausal explanations, pointing to a combination of Nazi ideology, historical circumstances that encouraged radicalization, and the impunity permitted by war."
37,Three Books on Arms Control,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-12-14/three-books-arms-control,Three Books on Arms Control,"Gottemoeller’s lucid, candid, and engaging memoir of her role in getting the Russians to agree to the 2011 New START treaty—and persuading the U.S. Senate to ratify it—is an encomium to the hard slog of diplomacy. Her account demonstrates the importance of having a strong negotiating team with good morale, allowing technical experts time to work on the details, producing agreement texts that are both clear and mean the same thing in multiple languages, forging a working relationship with interlocutors (even when this requires some performative losses of temper), dealing with unrealistic demands from bosses in Washington and dissuading them from imposing unrealistic agendas, and creating public support for an agreement to keep pressure on the Senate to ratify it. Unsurprisingly, she reports that both she and her Russian counterpart had to be treated for high blood pressure when they returned home for a Christmas break. And she also notes that because New START did not make strides toward the abolition of nuclear weapons, it got only lukewarm support from advocates of disarmament. She hoped the agreement would be followed by more such deals, but her book is a reminder of how hard it was to get even this far."

His explanations for the protectionist turn and its connection to populism are not new: multilateralism is the project of much-resented elites, foreigners are viewed with suspicion, and populist leaders have no scruples about shattering the norms that buttress the global trading system. More original, however, are Jones’s ambitious proposals for galvanizing support for that system. He calls on the U.S. Congress to reassert its control over presidential decisions on national security tariffs and the use of Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, which authorizes the application of punitive tariffs against other countries. The European Union should address its “democratic deficit” so that European publics feel that their voices are heard when the European Commission negotiates trade agreements. The World Trade Organization should adopt a more flexible interpretation of the escape clauses in its agreements to avoid alienating nationalist members. Jones concludes that “the prospects for a more enlightened U.S. trade policy” in the post-Trump era remain uncertain. The same could be said of other countries’ trade policies."

She favors the preferred intervention of economists for addressing climate change, namely taxing greenhouse gas emissions. But she stresses that not all fossil fuels generate the same emissions: differences in crude products and refining techniques mean that the emissions produced by otherwise equivalent amounts of oil and gas can vary by a factor of ten. Thus, simply taxing gas at the pump but neglecting emissions along the supply chain may fail to shift the production of fossil fuels toward cleaner sources, unnecessarily raising costs while squandering opportunities to curb climate change. Better emission-related data, reported by companies subject to stronger government oversight, can inform better policy. Gordon emphasizes that there is no silver bullet for the climate crisis. Fossil fuels, like it or not, will still be in use in 2050. But they should be priced more appropriately, in line with their social costs. They should be produced using clean refining techniques and supplemented with clean energy sources developed through collaboration among the public sector, the private sector, and academia."

Technological change, they emphasize, takes time to unfold and creates new job opportunities even while destroying old ones. In fact, public policy has been more important than technology in shaping labor-market outcomes, specifically for less skilled workers without college degrees. Although all advanced economies have experienced technological change, the United States has seen a sharper divergence between productivity and wages, a more dramatic decline in labor’s share of national income, and a more pronounced rise in poorly compensated jobs, all as a result of policy, not technology. These economic trends and their social and political consequences, the authors argue, can be reversed by an increase in the federal minimum wage, which would spur employers to take steps to boost the productivity of low-paid workers; by legal changes that enhance the ability of workers to organize and represent themselves collectively in negotiations; and by tax policies that encourage firms to invest more extensively in worker training."

The author ranges widely over economics, finance, geopolitics, and epidemiology, displaying a firm grasp of both minutiae and the big picture. His focus is on central bankers, finance ministers, and the public policy responses they crafted under intense pressure. Tooze applauds them for heading off the worst but does not shy away from difficult questions about the implications of their actions for the future: he wonders whether central bank independence will remain viable given how central bankers stretched their mandates and what unprecedented budget deficits and heavy public debts imply for fiscal sustainability and fiscal rules going forward. Future scholars will see this book as a record of how informed observers saw the events of 2020 as they unfolded. Readers, having lived through those same events, might ask how they themselves would have written this history."
42,Career and Family: Women’s Century-Long Journey Toward Equity,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-12-14/career-and-family-womens-century-long-journey-toward-equity,Career and Family: Women’s Century-Long Journey Toward Equity,"In this deeply researched, engagingly written, and surprisingly personal book, Goldin summarizes the history and current state of gender disparities in employment and pay, both in general and specifically for college-educated women. For much of the twentieth century, the pay gap between women and men reflected discrimination, the consequences of marriage, differences in educational attainment, and occupational choices. Today, by contrast, those obstacles to gender parity have been reduced, and the pay gap reflects other causes, including how childbirth and child rearing interrupt female labor-force participation. More important, it reflects how women tend to choose employers and career paths that allow for flexibility and do not require overtime hours and erratic work schedules. This, in turn, allows their spouses to pursue better-compensated positions, further accentuating the gap in “couple equity.” Addressing this problem will require firms to make flexible and part-time work more productive and better remunerated and governments to provide more generous childcare. More fundamentally, redressing the pay gap will require revisiting the social norm that women are primarily responsible for child rearing."

In 1898, with the Spanish-American War, it launched its own imperial career. This fascinating and deeply researched book explores American thinking about empire in the decades between the Civil War and the conflict with Spain. Priest uncovers a vibrant debate in the United States about the dangers and opportunities of following in European imperial footsteps, often provoked by concrete British, French, German, Ottoman, and Spanish moves on the world stage. Priest shows that a strand of anti-imperial thinking (the legacy of the anticolonial American Revolution) remained prominent throughout the nineteenth century, often manifest in the claim that U.S. overseas expansion was in fact commercial rather than territorial and that the country’s ideals were meant to inspire worldwide movements toward constitutional self-rule. But anti-imperialist rhetoric was often matched by support for an ambitious global presence to accompany the United States’ rising wealth and power. Ideas of racial and civilizational hierarchy permeated the thinking of American elites, even as those elites believed in the progressive role their country could play in world affairs."
44,The Closure of the International System: How Institutions Create Political Equalities and Hierarchies,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-12-14/closure-international-system-how-institutions-create-political,The Closure of the International System: How Institutions Create Political Equalities and Hierarchies,"In this groundbreaking book, Viola argues that all international systems contain two competing logics of order, pitting equality and inclusion against inequality and exclusion. The United Nations, the premier multilateral organization, enshrines the principle of sovereign equality. But other organizations, such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, have differential voting quotas, and the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty formally divides the world into nuclear haves and have-nots. The book develops a “closure theory” to explain why the rules and institutions of the international system exhibit this mix of equality and inequality of rights and privileges. States have used both inclusion and exclusion to shape the global playing field. Those seeking to establish rules and institutions of global governance peddle universalist principles to attract other states. But more exclusive groupings of states—clubs—provide ways for states to assert dominance, define property rights, and control the flow and distribution of resources. Viola shows how the dynamics of inclusion and exclusion are linked and work together. The modern system of international relations may be both more open and more global than ever before, but it is also a bounded political space run by privileged members."
45,Democracy in the Time of Coronavirus,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-12-14/democracy-time-coronavirus,Democracy in the Time of Coronavirus,"In this stirring manifesto, the renowned political theorist Allen argues that the United States’ woeful response to the COVID-19 pandemic must serve as a wake-up call for Americans to rebuild their public health infrastructure and renew their constitutional democracy. For Allen, the crux of the problem is the breakdown of the American social contract, a rupture that left minorities and low-income workers unprotected in the face of the pandemic. She sees this as a “learning moment,” an opportunity to pose constitutional questions about how the United States might better equip itself to cope with global threats. Protecting what the U.S. Constitution calls the “general welfare” is the first task of government, and the laudable recent efforts of other democracies, such as Australia and Germany, help point the way. As Allen sees it, the failures of the United States to protect people from the deadly virus—and from the human suffering and social inequalities that followed—are more than public policy missteps; they reveal a deeper failure to make good on the “responsibilities of governance” that undergird the legitimacy of a constitutional democracy."

At one level, the book is a work of contemporary history, telling the story of an ongoing global political crisis—a chaotic spectacle of uncertainty, fear, and political expediency in which multilateral cooperation quickly gave way to nationalism, populism, and great-power rivalry. At another level, the book seeks to use the crisis as a sort of diagnostic tool to identify the long-term trajectory of the international order. Kahl and Wright argue that the pandemic has played the role of catalyst—more than cause—in the final breakdown of the U.S.-led global system. The era of great-power cooperation is over. Transnational interdependence—in economics, security, public health, and the environment—may be growing, but so, too, is the U.S.-Chinese rivalry, creating a negative synergy that will make the world less stable and less safe. The United States and like-minded countries should give up on building a global system of governance, the authors argue, and instead work together to address shared dangers, while upholding the liberal international principles of transparency and accountability."

The book builds on portraits of the American theologian Reinhold Niebuhr, the French philosophers Albert Camus and Raymond Aron, and the British philosopher Isaiah Berlin, mid-twentieth-century intellectuals who sought to defend liberalism by reimagining it. In each case, these thinkers were preoccupied by how liberalism could survive as a way of life in the face of extremist projects that had as their ultimate aim the root-and-branch elimination of liberalism and democracy. In each case, Cherniss identifies a similar move: the defense of liberalism less as a set of policies and institutions and more as an “ethic of politics”—a political temperament that acknowledged its own weaknesses and vulnerabilities but also its deep virtues as the great protector of human freedom. In each case, these thinkers struggled with the “liberal predicament,” which was to find a way to combat the ruthlessness of antiliberal movements without also becoming ruthless and illiberal."

These projects often failed to achieve their goals, but few so completely as the recent one in Afghanistan. After 20 years, a great many lives lost, and untold billions spent, the Taliban—the very same group that the United States had intervened to remove at the outset—returned to power while U.S. personnel were still mid-evacuation."
49,Digital Disorder,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/issue-packages/2021-12-14/digital-disorder,War and Peace in the Cyber Age,"A decade ago, U.S. Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta issued a stark warning about the dangers of a “cyber–Pearl Harbor”—a digital attack that would cause real-​world death and destruction. The subsequent years have, in one sense, made that fear seem overblown; after all, the most dire scenarios that Panetta and others dreaded have not come to pass. But in another sense, the warning seems, if anything, too restrained: today, governments, businesses, and citizens alike face pervasive and unrelenting cyberthreats that would have been hard to imagine in 2012, adding layers of risk and complexity to already fraught problems of security, politics, and governance."
50,The Coming Carbon Tsunami,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/world/2021-12-14/coming-carbon-tsunami,The Coming Carbon Tsunami,"In the struggle to combat climate change, the world is fighting the last war. Since the dawn of the Industrial Revolution, countries have released one and a half trillion metric tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. The largest cumulative emissions have come from the United States, European countries, China, and Russia, in that order. But these countries are now prosperous enough to pay for policies that can place them on the path to net-zero emissions by midcentury. The top emitting countries of the future could come largely from the developing world—countries such as Brazil, India, Indonesia, and South Africa, which face the herculean task of bringing millions out of poverty while simultaneously adapting to the harsh realities of climate change."
51,The Art of War,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/review-essay/2021-12-14/art-war-culture-geopolitics,The Art of War,"Around 1949, fresh out of college at Northwestern University, my mother moved to New York to take a job at NBC. She arrived at the dawn of U.S. television. NBC had entered the business just about a decade earlier. Rather than being assigned to a sitcom or a variety show, she ended up at the NBC Opera Theatre, one of the splashiest, most expensive ventures in the new lineup. The corporation had long sponsored its own radio orchestra under the leadership of the famed conductor Arturo Toscanini, who had fled Mussolini’s Italy in the 1930s for refuge in the United States. When television came along, executives assumed that one of its functions would be to make Toscanini-style high culture available to the American masses. That dream—that a major television orchestra and opera company would be both popular and profitable—lasted an astonishing 15 years, from 1949 to 1964, before NBC concluded that the future of television lay elsewhere."
52,The Real Crisis of Global Order,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/world/2021-12-14/illiberalism-real-crisis-global-order,The Real Crisis of Global Order,"The election of Donald Trump in 2016 sparked a major debate over the nature and fate of the liberal international order, suddenly caught, it seemed, between the Charybdis of illiberal great-power challengers and the Scylla of a hostile U.S. president. Trump may have lost the presidency in 2020, but the liberal order remains under threat. If anything, recent events have underlined the magnitude of the challenges it faces—and, most important, that these challenges are only one manifestation of a much broader crisis endangering liberalism itself."
53,The Case for Cyber-Realism,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2021-12-14/case-cyber-realism,The Case for Cyber-Realism,"In September 2015, U.S. President Barack Obama stood beside Chinese President Xi Jinping in the White House Rose Garden and announced a historic deal to curb cyber-related economic espionage. The scope of the agreement was modest, committing China and the United States only to stop stealing or aiding in the cyber-enabled theft of intellectual property in order to boost domestic industry. It was an easy promise for the United States to make, since Washington had long prohibited U.S. intelligence services from conducting economic espionage for the benefit of private companies. But it was a groundbreaking pledge for China, whose military and intelligence agencies had for more than a decade engaged in massive cyber-enabled theft of U.S. intellectual property and state secrets in order to advantage Chinese companies."
54,The Revolution Will Not Be Privatized,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/world/2021-12-14/revolution-will-not-be-privatized,The Revolution Will Not Be Privatized,"In September 1970, the economist Milton Friedman wrote a seminal essay entitled “The Social Responsibility of Business Is to Increase Its Profits.” Company leaders, Friedman argued, should be entirely concerned with making money for shareholders, not with their businesses’ environmental, social, or broader economic impacts."
55,America’s Cyber-Reckoning,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2021-12-14/americas-cyber-reckoning,America’s Cyber-Reckoning,"A decade ago, the conventional wisdom held that the world was on the cusp of a new era of cyberconflict in which catastrophic computer-based attacks would wreak havoc on the physical world. News media warned of doomsday scenarios; officials in Washington publicly fretted about a “cyber–Pearl Harbor” that would take lives and destroy critical infrastructure. The most dire predictions, however, did not come to pass. The United States has not been struck by devastating cyberattacks with physical effects; it seems that even if U.S. adversaries wanted to carry out such assaults, traditional forms of deterrence would prevent them from acting."
56,A World Without Trust,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/world/2021-12-14/world-without-trust,A World Without Trust,"When sounding the alarm over cyberthreats, policymakers and analysts have typically employed a vocabulary of conflict and catastrophe. As early as 2001, James Adams, a co-founder of the cybersecurity firm iDefense, warned in these pages that cyberspace was “a new international battlefield,” where future military campaigns would be won or lost. In subsequent years, U.S. defense officials warned of a “cyber–Pearl Harbor,” in the words of then Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, and a “cyber 9/11,” according to then Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano. In 2015, James Clapper, then the director of national intelligence, said the United States must prepare for a “cyber Armageddon” but acknowledged it was not the most likely scenario. In response to the threat, officials argued that cyberspace should be understood as a “domain” of conflict, with “key terrain” that the United States needed to take or defend."
57,Xi Jinping’s New World Order,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2021-12-09/xi-jinpings-new-world-order,Xi Jinping’s New World Order,"Xi Jinping savored the moment. Speaking before China’s annual gathering of nearly 3,000 representatives to the National People’s Congress in Beijing in March 2021, the Chinese president took a post-pandemic victory lap, proclaiming that his country had been the first to tame COVID-19, the first to resume work, and the first to regain positive economic growth. It was the result, he argued, of “self-confidence in our path, self-confidence in our theories, self-confidence in our system, self-confidence in our culture.” And he further shared his pride that “now, when our young people go abroad, they can stand tall and feel proud—unlike us when we were young.” For Xi, China’s success in controlling the spread of the novel coronavirus was yet more evidence that he was on the right track: China was reclaiming its historic position of leadership and centrality on the global stage. The brief official history of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) that was published the following month reinforced his assessment. It claimed that Xi had brought China “closer to the center of the world stage than it has ever been. The nation has never been closer to its own rebirth.”"
58,Keeping the Wrong Secrets,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2021-12-07/hacking-cybersecurity-keeping-wrong-secrets,Keeping the Wrong Secrets,"The United States keeps a lot of secrets. In 2017, the last year for which there are complete data, roughly four million Americans with security clearances classified around 50 million documents at a cost to U.S. taxpayers of around $18 billion."
59,India’s Stalled Rise,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/india/2021-12-14/indias-stalled-rise,India’s Stalled Rise,"For much of the first decade of the twenty-first century, India’s economy captivated the world’s imagination. Other countries looked on enviously as India became the fastest-growing free-market democracy, seemingly vaulting effortlessly from the status of a nation mired in poverty into that of a high-tech, car-owning, middle-class society. Powered by information technology companies such as Infosys, Tata Consultancy Services, and Wipro, the country was poised to be a global player, perhaps even an economic superpower."
60,The End of Cyber-Anarchy?,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/russian-federation/2021-12-14/end-cyber-anarchy,The End of Cyber-Anarchy?,"Ransomware attacks, election interference, corporate espionage, threats to the electric grid: based on the drumbeat of current headlines, there seems to be little hope of bringing a measure of order to the anarchy of cyberspace. The relentless bad news stories paint a picture of an ungoverned online world that is growing more dangerous by the day—with grim implications not just for cyberspace itself but also for economies, geopolitics, democratic societies, and basic questions of war and peace."
61,A New Cuba?,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/review-essay/2021-12-14/new-cuba,A New Cuba?,"While I was on a visit to Moscow a short time after the Soviet collapse, a retired senior Red Army general sighed nostalgically when I asked about his time in Cuba during the 1962 Cuban missile crisis. “Kuba,” as he called it, heavy on the K, the rest of the word drawn out in a kind of caress, had held a special place in the Soviets’ hearts, he said. Its commitment to revolution was passionate and courageous, and in exchange, the Soviets had given everything they could to help sustain the country, going to great lengths to make sure the islanders had whatever they needed to survive. “We spoiled them,” he said, throwing up his hands and chuckling ruefully."
62,All Against All,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/middle-east/2021-12-02/iran-middle-east-all-against-all,All Against All,"The Biden administration’s mantra for the Middle East is simple: “end the ‘forever wars.’” The White House is preoccupied with managing the challenge posed by China and aims to disentangle the United States from the Middle East’s seemingly endless and unwinnable conflicts. But the United States’ disengagement threatens to leave a political vacuum that will be filled by sectarian rivalries, paving the way for a more violent and unstable region."
63,Green Upheaval,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/world/2021-11-30/geopolitics-energy-green-upheaval,Green Upheaval,"It is not hard to understand why people dream of a future defined by clean energy. As greenhouse gas emissions continue to grow and as extreme weather events become more frequent and harmful, the current efforts to move beyond fossil fuels appear woefully inadequate. Adding to the frustration, the geopolitics of oil and gas are alive and well—and as fraught as ever. Europe is in the throes of a full-fledged energy crisis, with staggering electricity prices forcing businesses across the continent to shutter and energy firms to declare bankruptcy, positioning Russian President Vladimir Putin to take advantage of his neighbors’ struggles by leveraging his country’s natural gas reserves. In September, blackouts reportedly led Chinese Vice Premier Han Zheng to instruct his country’s state-owned energy companies to secure supplies for winter at any cost. And as oil prices surge above $80 per barrel, the United States and other energy-hungry countries are pleading with major producers, including Saudi Arabia, to ramp up their output, giving Riyadh more clout in a newly tense relationship and suggesting the limits of Washington’s energy “independence.”"

As David Bowie might say, it is time to turn and face the strange."
1,"Humor, Silence, and Civil Society in Nigeria",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2017-02-13/humor-silence-and-civil-society-nigeria,"Humor, Silence, and Civil Society in Nigeria","Dissatisfied with the increasing tendency of scholars to reduce the meaning of “civil society” to the activities of nongovernmental organizations, Obadare argues that the everyday discourse of Nigerians produces the kind of political effects—including resistance to the state’s authority and demands for accountability—that political scientists usually ascribe only to more institutional forms of civil society. Obadare contributes to the debate about what counts as civil society by making a compelling case that “associating is not undertaken by associations alone”: it also results from ordinary social life. His book is at its best when it brings his argument to life by cataloging and analyzing the witty stories, jokes, and wordplay that Nigerians employ to mock powerful politicians and government institutions. Public discourse undoubtedly shapes Nigerians’ attitudes toward their government, but it’s unclear whether it truly promotes state responsiveness, as Obadare maintains, or whether it mostly just palliates mass discontent."
2,Guinea-Bissau: Micro-State to “Narco-State”,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2017-02-13/guinea-bissau-micro-state-narco-state,Guinea-Bissau: Micro-State to “Narco-State”,"It is no surprise that Guinea-Bissau, with a population of less than two million and a GDP of just $7.5 billion, receives little attention from scholars. This excellent collection of essays on the West African country’s complicated politics is the first comprehensive English-language study of the topic to appear in more than a decade. Guinea-Bissau has weathered an unstable democracy since 1994, when it held its first multiparty elections. A brief civil war broke out in 1998–99; since then, there have been a number of military coups. Taken together, the essays collected here do a better job of describing the country’s political environment than of explaining the persistence of its toxic mixture of extreme poverty, weak state capacity, and rapacious elites. But a number of them usefully examine Guinea-Bissau’s transformation into a “narco-state,” the result of collusion between authorities and Latin American drug cartels, which has turned the country into a significant way station along the routes of the international drug trade."
3,Beyond Ethnic Politics in Africa,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2017-02-13/beyond-ethnic-politics-africa,Beyond Ethnic Politics in Africa,"The ethnic violence that has marred recent elections in African countries, such as Kenya and Nigeria, has reinforced the notion that African politics is structured by stringent ethnic logics. In fact, as Koter shows in her fine book, the political salience of ethnicity varies enormously within and across African countries. Even in countries with easily identifiable ethnic groups, politicians and political parties don’t necessarily rely on such cleavages. Based on a careful comparison of Benin and Senegal (and buttressed with examples from Botswana, Guinea, Kenya, and Mali), Koter’s research reveals that African leaders play the ethnic card on the national level only when they can’t rely on strong traditional or religious leaders at the local level to mobilize voters on their behalf or when they lack the organizational capacity and resources to make broader appeals based on promises to deliver services and create economic opportunity. Koter’s model of careful scholarship is representative of a wider trend toward high-quality research on the evolution of African electoral politics."
4,The Mayor of Mogadishu: A Story of Chaos and Redemption in the Ruins of Somalia,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2017-02-13/mayor-mogadishu-story-chaos-and-redemption-ruins-somalia,The Mayor of Mogadishu: A Story of Chaos and Redemption in the Ruins of Somalia,"With the end of the Islamist militia al Shabab’s control of Mogadishu in 2011, the establishment of a new federal constitution in 2012, and the significant decline in political violence since then, Somalia seems as close as it ever has been to escaping the bloodshed and chaos that have plagued it for so long. Harding’s stunning book relates the country’s recent history through the perspective of one man. The result is great storytelling by a master reporter. Mohamud “Tarzan” Nur was born into rural poverty before Somalia won its independence from the United Kingdom in 1960. He was brought up in a bleak orphanage in Mogadishu and spent his childhood as a street urchin respected for his fighting skills. But he grew up to become a civil engineer and successful businessman, first in Saudi Arabia and later in London. In 2010, he returned to Somalia after the country’s transitional government appointed him mayor of Mogadishu. At its strongest, Harding’s portrait of him resembles a Somali version of Charles Dickens’ David Copperfield; the passages evoking 1960s street life in Mogadishu alone make the book worth reading. Harding never whitewashes Nur’s faults, giving voice to some of his detractors and pointing to a few shady episodes that have dogged him. But Harding renders Nur as a symbol of the optimism and resilience that Somalis have demonstrated even in the face of their country’s collapse. By the end of the book, most readers will find themselves rooting for Nur, Mogadishu, and Somalia."
5,Subversive Lives: A Family Memoir of the Marcos Years,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2017-02-13/subversive-lives-family-memoir-marcos-years,Subversive Lives: A Family Memoir of the Marcos Years,"A militant leftist movement has existed in various forms in the Philippines since the early twentieth century. It burgeoned from the 1960s through the 1980s as students and young professionals reacted to Ferdinand Marcos’ repressive rule and his 1972 imposition of martial law. Seven of the ten Quimpo siblings were among those who joined the Maoism-influenced Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP). All who survive have contributed chapters to this collective memoir, which manages to present a coherent story despite the multitude of voices. The family saga began when the older siblings demonstrated against the Vietnam War as high school students, to the horror of their cautious, hard-working parents. Step by step, the children deepened their involvement, until most were living on the run, trying to spark an armed revolution. The male siblings suffered imprisonment, torture, and exile. With the end of the Marcos dictatorship and the breakup of the CPP, the surviving siblings returned to their middle-class roots as teachers and government officials, although they remain outraged by the injustices in Philippine society. At once political and personal, this is a valuable source on a lesser-known chapter of Philippine history."

The lectures collected in his book brim with insights. “The small countries of Southeast Asia have lived in the midst of competition by larger powers for many centuries,” he points out; “to balance, hedge, and bandwagon is embedded in our foreign policy dna.” Washington and Beijing will find a way to get along since the United States cannot contain China and China cannot expel the United States from Asia. But he warns the region’s smaller countries that “when major powers strike a deal, they generally try to make lesser beings pay the price.” An equal opportunity critic, he calls into question the alleged universality of Western values while also admonishing China that a great power “cannot forever portray itself as a victim without calling its intentions into question.” And to endear himself to academics, he states, “Any resemblance between what I studied and what I did for a living is almost coincidental.”"
7,Electoral Reform and National Security in Japan: From Pork to Foreign Policy,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2017-02-13/electoral-reform-and-national-security-japan-pork-foreign-policy,Electoral Reform and National Security in Japan: From Pork to Foreign Policy,"Before 1994, Japan elected the lower house of its parliament using an unusual “multimember district” system that forced candidates from each party to run not only against the other party but also against one another. As a result, candidates tended to build ties with relatively small, safe pools of voters, delivering them a stream of targeted building projects, subsidies, and other help that Catalinac terms “pork.” In 1994, the electoral system was changed to one that combined single-member districts and proportional representation, forcing candidates to broaden their appeal to larger constituencies. Ever since, scholars have debated the policy impact. Catalinac uses an innovative computerized analysis of candidates’ election manifestoes to show that after the reform they paid more attention to national security issues than before, and she argues that this helps explain the government’s moves toward a more assertive security policy. She responds resourcefully to possible objections, among them that the manifestoes don’t matter much in Japanese election campaigns and that security policy more likely shifted because of changes in the threat environment. Her contribution will not end the debate, but it offers an interesting new twist."

Surveying the experience of three Chinese counties, Ang cuts through the usual debate about whether good governance or economic growth should come first, seeing a more cyclical process at work. First, authorities allowed markets to emerge even though they were hampered by corruption, weak property rights, and underregulation. Market activity then generated problems that required officials to build stronger institutions, which in turn fostered the further development of markets."
9,Ike’s Gamble: America’s Rise to Dominance in the Middle East,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2017-02-13/ikes-gamble-americas-rise-dominance-middle-east,Ike’s Gamble: America’s Rise to Dominance in the Middle East,"In this richly researched, brisk, and insightful book, Doran argues that during the Suez crisis of 1956, U.S. President Dwight Eisenhower and his advisers were in the grip of a misleading diplomatic paradigm, operating under a flawed set of assumptions about how international politics worked. Despite mounting evidence to the contrary, they believed they could appease the Egyptian leader Gamal Abdel Nasser by extracting concessions from his British, French, and Israeli adversaries. Instead, U.S. protection only whetted Nasser’s geopolitical appetite, and Eisenhower eventually rued his administration’s folly. Ike’s Gamble is broadly persuasive, but it loses traction in places. The author sweepingly characterizes, and sometimes dismisses, the work of other historians but seldom tells readers who they are. Moreover, although Doran deftly exposes Nasser’s cynicism and aggressiveness, he downplays the defensive aspects of the Egyptian leader’s position. During the period in question, Egypt endured Israeli sabotage and an invasion launched by British, French, and Israeli forces. Meanwhile, Egypt’s ally Syria faced subversive attacks launched by Iraq, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Doran acknowledges most of those realities but, echoing the U.S. policymakers he criticizes, does not permit them to dislodge his own favored paradigm. Still, the book offers a forceful and challenging interpretation of the Suez crisis that no student of Middle Eastern history can afford to ignore."
10,Shadow Wars: The Secret Struggle for the Middle East,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2017-02-13/shadow-wars-secret-struggle-middle-east,Shadow Wars: The Secret Struggle for the Middle East,"According to Davidson, for more than a century, the intelligence and military establishments of the United Kingdom and the United States have been leading a hidden struggle against implicitly progressive forces in the Middle East, driven by a desire for geopolitical advantage and the control of oil. Notwithstanding the declaration of a “war on terror,” Davidson believes that the preferred instruments of the Americans and the British have been Islamist movements: the Muslim Brotherhood, the Taliban, and, most recently, the Islamic State (also known as ISIS). The Americans and the British have often found themselves fighting their own proxies, but they knew that would happen, Davidson claims. They therefore fight halfheartedly, he contends, so that such groups continue to survive. Nearly all of Davidson’s sources are in the public domain: he uncovers little original evidence for his argument and instead assembles familiar pieces into an unfamiliar shape. The results are unconvincing. For example, if Western powers fostered ISIS in order to drive a Sunni wedge between Iran and Syria, why did they bother to topple Saddam Hussein, who already played that role? More troubling, Davidson’s analysis denies agency to Islamists, Middle Easterners, and pretty much everyone else: in his view, we are all merely pawns in the shadow wars."
11,The Fall of the Turkish Model: How the Arab Uprisings Brought Down Islamic Liberalism,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2017-02-13/fall-turkish-model-how-arab-uprisings-brought-down-islamic,The Fall of the Turkish Model: How the Arab Uprisings Brought Down Islamic Liberalism,"The “Turkish model” of governance promises the merger of Islam with democracy and free markets. It first took shape under Prime Minister Turgut Ozal in the 1980s and then crystallized under Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who has led Turkey since 2002. In this ambitious book, Tugal compares Turkey’s approach to those of Egypt, Iran, and Tunisia by examining how neoliberal economic strategies have played out in each place, paying particular attention to how governments have tried to engage devout Muslim constituencies in the neoliberal project. Tugal argues that the Arab uprisings of 2010–11 and the large antidevelopment protests that took place in Istanbul in 2013 demonstrated the failure of those efforts. But Tugal’s analysis is disjointed; cause and effect chase each other’s tails. He relies on jargon and leaves undefined key concepts, such as “political society,” “power bloc,” and “passive revolution”—a significant problem, since the book hinges not on new empirical evidence but rather on an analytic framework."
12,A Revolution Undone: Egypt’s Road Beyond Revolt,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2017-02-13/revolution-undone-egypts-road-beyond-revolt,A Revolution Undone: Egypt’s Road Beyond Revolt,"This book considers Egypt’s recent uprisings and descent into military rule and concludes with a brief treatment of the regime of Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, the general who seized power in 2013. Hellyer writes engagingly, although he spends a bit too much time assessing what he himself got right and wrong as an analyst of these developments and not enough time explaining where he thinks Egypt is now heading. Hellyer believes there was nothing inevitable about Egypt’s evolution since the overthrow of Hosni Mubarak in 2011. What Hellyer calls “the revolutionary coalition” of Islamists, secular democrats, and “remnants” of the Mubarak regime could have settled on a single candidate in the 2012 presidential election, rather than splitting up, with the Islamists backing Mohamed Morsi, a former leader of the Muslim Brotherhood. Hellyer argues that things might have turned out differently had the Brotherhood not wrongly interpreted Morsi’s narrow election victory as a popular mandate and had Morsi not proved such a ham-fisted leader. Sisi and his allies in the deep state had not originally planned to depose Morsi but ended up doing so in a brutal fashion. If the Sisi regime cannot relieve Egypt’s socioeconomic pressures, the next uprisings will be led by the poor and will likely be violent."
13,The Egyptians: A Radical History of Egypt’s Unfinished Revolution,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2017-02-13/egyptians-radical-history-egypts-unfinished-revolution,The Egyptians: A Radical History of Egypt’s Unfinished Revolution,"This is not remotely a history, but it is a lively account full of vignettes that capture a good deal of contemporary Egypt. Shenker, a former correspondent for The Guardian, sees the country as locked in a struggle between neoliberal reforms and the revolutionary impulses of ordinary people ground down by international capitalism and its agents in the deep state. He issues quite a few Olympian judgments that brook no dissent, as when he declares that “neoliberalism is a political project and its implementation always involves a mass transfer from the poor to the rich.” But Shenker is also an eloquent witness to several of Egypt’s beleaguered communities—peasants, factory workers, bloggers, women, gays—who were momentarily liberated by the uprising of 2011. Only one Islamist, a jovial Salafist, slips into the narrative. Shenker seems to view Islamism as one of the many guises that the oppressed don to face their oppressors. His main message is that the forces of revolution are loose in the land: the movement that toppled Hosni Mubarak was only the opening salvo."

In a detailed look at the nexus of American academic expertise on the Middle East and Washington’s diplomatic and intelligence power centers, from the Wilson era through the Obama presidency, Khalil keeps his prose crisp and his judgments sober. The supply of area experts fluent in local languages and familiar with the region’s populations has never naturally met the demand from the public and private sectors, so the U.S. government has either directly funded area studies or encouraged private foundations to do so. Such interventions began during World War II, and the fight against the Nazis was so compelling that few objected when academics served in the U.S. Office of Strategic Services, which later morphed into the CIA. But as the disaster of the Vietnam War unfolded, area experts warned against academic complicity with U.S. imperialism. It is not clear if the challenge posed by violent jihadism has overcome such concerns, but it has certainly given rise to a new cottage industry in terrorism and counter-insurgency studies."

In reality, they grow out of an intricate knot of contested narratives and a web of strategic calculations shaped by emotional and moral impulses. Complicating things further is the fact that these are not two-way duels between major powers but complex interactions influenced by the actions of third parties. As Toal reveals in his detailed account of the events in Georgia and his somewhat less probing retelling of the story in Ukraine, the conflicts have unfolded in the twisted wreckage of an imploded Russian empire, unleashing new ambitions and fears and producing new and more complicated relationships. His analysis is not likely to affect how a reader assigns blame for the outcomes in the two cases, but it will enrich the reader’s understanding of them."
16,Bosnia’s Paralyzed Peace,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2017-02-13/bosnias-paralyzed-peace,Bosnia’s Paralyzed Peace,"Readers who think the Bosnian tragedy ended long ago and that the 1995 Dayton accords set the country on a path to peace and stability are in for a surprise. After retracing the Bosnian war, the hopes surrounding the agreement that ended it, and the two decades of increasingly fraught efforts to implement the accords, Bennett warns that, despite generous contributions from international organizations, Bosnia is not evolving “into a self-sustaining and stable democracy.” Instead, the country is “deteriorating at an accelerating pace.” Meanwhile, “a fatalistic cynicism appears to have taken root,” even as the international community stubbornly hopes that the lure of Bosnian integration into Europe will allow the center to hold. As Bennett makes clear in this tough-minded book, the Dayton settlement ended the violence but dealt more with its symptoms than its underlying causes, which still linger. The problem is that Bosnian elites—Croats, Serbs, and Bosniaks alike—continue to pursue the same narrow ethnonationalist agendas that sparked the war rather than encouraging the pursuit of larger national goals. Moving past this zero-sum stalemate will require what Bennett calls a new “logic of Bosnian politics,” and he lays out steps for achieving it."
17,Russia: What Everyone Needs to Know,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2017-02-13/russia-what-everyone-needs-know,Russia: What Everyone Needs to Know,"At first glance, one might think this volume were merely a primer that takes the uninitiated through the key stages of Russia’s history. But that would be to sell short a shrewd, bountiful book. With a finely tuned sense of choice, Colton selects the historical and physical features that have made Russia Russia and then sets about exploring a wide range of issues: how the country grew so large, the imprint of empire on its character, the reasons it chose revolution over reform, the triumph of the Bolsheviks, and the ways in which Soviet leaders Joseph Stalin, Nikita Khrushchev, and Leonid Brezhnev defined their respective eras. His discussion becomes even more refined and comprehensive when he turns to contemporary Russia, touching on almost every significant aspect of the country’s foreign and domestic development during the Yeltsin and Putin periods. Colton avoids simple formulas and undergirds his analysis with carefully chosen data, delivered in a cool, evenhanded fashion. This is particularly true of his assessment of the Putin regime and its prospects. Russia has never, and will never, follow foreign models, Colton argues: “What Russia can and must become is a better edition of itself.”"
18,The War Within: Diaries From the Siege of Leningrad,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2017-02-13/war-within-diaries-siege-leningrad,The War Within: Diaries From the Siege of Leningrad,"The battle for Leningrad lasted 1,127 days; the city was under siege for 900 of them. Between 1.6 million and two million Soviet citizens died, 800,000 of them civilians—40 percent of the city’s prewar population. (As Peri points out, the overall death toll approximates the total number of members of the U.S. military who died in war between 1776 and 1975.) Leningrad residents of all types—from factory foremen to teachers, party workers to professional writers—kept diaries during the ordeal. Peri searches through 125 of them to capture how the nightmare deconstructed the writers’ prior realities and altered their sense of humanity. Her portrait is a sensitive, at times almost poetic examination of their emotions and disordered mental states. It both contrasts with and complements the equally accurate official Soviet portrait of a stalwart population standing firm in the face of evil and in defense of Soviet ideals. Peri makes plain that even though the diarists endured the total transformation of their fundamental sense of reality, their social relationships, and the nature of their social order, most of them did not become alienated from the values and basic outlook of the Soviet system."
19,Should We Fear Russia?,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2017-02-13/should-we-fear-russia,Should We Fear Russia?,"Rare is the foreign policy analyst who can apply cool, dispassionate, balanced, and critical analysis to the policies of his or her own country while also understanding and explaining the impulses that drive other countries, particularly adversaries. Trenin, a Russian scholar, is one such analyst. In this short, tightly argued book, his answer to the question in the book’s title is yes, but not for the oversimplified reasons most in the West would give. He first lays out the many factors that have wrongly increased Western wariness of Vladimir Putin’s Russia and treats them to an astringent wash. Then he turns to the very real challenges that Russia does present to the United States in eastern Europe, the Middle East, and greater Eurasia—and to the different challenges it poses to western European countries, for whom Russia represents less a looming hegemonic rival than an alienated neighbor that is turning eastward. Trenin concludes with some smart suggestions for how the West can address what should be its real concerns about Russia. Most of the steps he recommends, however, would depend on a grand geopolitical modus vivendi that would require a level of wisdom not yet evident in either Moscow or Western capitals."

A leading intellectual and former Mexican foreign minister who has journeyed from the socialist left toward the reformist center, Castañeda recognizes the progress, inadequate though it may be, that Mexico has made in reforming its democratic institutions and protecting its citizens’ social and economic rights. He strikes a cooperative note in discussing relations with the United States and urges Mexico to avoid anachronistic, destructive populism. He seeks to improve his country’s democracy by combating corruption and official impunity, protecting human rights, reforming the electoral system to facilitate the rise of independent candidates, defending minorities, and enhancing consumer protections. Castañeda argues that the dominant political parties are too thoroughly compromised to realize such goals: only an independent movement that rallies civil society can modernize Mexico. He sees hope in an educated, youthful middle class that perceives human rights as a legitimately Mexican concept rather than as a foreign import. In his denunciation of the political class, Castañeda may sound like antiestablishment populists elsewhere. But his campaign platform is more thoughtful, constructive, and, ultimately, affirmative."

The latest report details 395 business opportunities, up from the 326 in 2015 and 246 in 2014. The most pressing investment priorities remain unchanged: tourism, to earn badly needed foreign exchange (114 projects listed in the latest edition); energy, to replace declining subsidies from Venezuela (87 hydrocarbon projects and 23 that focus on renewables); and agriculture, to address food insecurity and promote export diversification (76 general agricultural projects and 13 more in the sugar industry). This long list of projects makes clear that many Cuban officials are well aware of their country’s pressing needs and realize that foreign firms could make vital contributions to the island’s future prosperity. Nevertheless, the government’s approval of foreign investment projects outside the tourism sector remains frustratingly slow, the result of bureaucratic sclerosis and lingering ideological opposition in some quarters of the leadership."

Chinese investments and foreign assistance in the region, although noteworthy, are not nearly as significant as many assume, and many Chinese projects announced with great fanfare remain in limbo, including a $50-billion-plus Nicaraguan canal. Overall, the contributors are sanguine about Chinese motives, finding that China’s commercial goals take precedence over its possible geopolitical aims—at least for now. A number of the authors note that generous Chinese lending, notably to Venezuela, might have enabled irresponsible populist spending. And some Chinese firms have violated regional norms by damaging natural environments, harming indigenous communities, and possibly engaging in corrupt practices. But Chinese businesses are learning, and their practices seem to be improving. Looking forward, if the United States confronts Latin America with less attractive policies on trade, investment, and labor movement, China may be tempted to fill the resulting vacuum. The transformation of China’s benign commercial interests into geopolitical ambitions may arrive sooner than the contributors to this volume—assembled prior to the election of Donald Trump as U.S. president—could possibly have anticipated."

Much also hinges on the evolving political attitudes of the growing middle classes: Will they be satisfied with gradual reform, or will they give in to the populist temptation? Among the more interesting findings is the fact that the region’s current demographic dividend—the high ratio of working people to dependents—will cease to pay off by the 2040s, when aging populations will require sharp gains in labor productivity in order to sustain prosperity. In one best-case scenario, the region would up its game in scientific innovation and export diversification. Another potential bright spot: climate change could transform South America into the breadbasket of the world. The region will also likely be blessed with a relative absence of ethnic and sectarian fissures, international terrorism, and interstate conflict, even though narcotics trafficking will persist."

Schama’s work on British portraiture is an example: it has appeared as a BBC series, a National Portrait Gallery exhibition, and now this book. Schama helped pioneer this multiplatform approach and remains one of the best in the business. He devotes successive chapters of this richly illustrated volume to the themes that he argues have lain at the heart of British national identity: power, love, fame, self, and “the people.” Schama does not stick to any overarching thesis for long, and he says little about deep causes, the sociological context, or even aesthetics. Rather, he recounts the personal foibles of the highlighted artists and their subjects in the manner of refined dinner-table gossip. The result is unfailingly amusing and intermittently risqué, delivered with smooth, slightly ironic panache."
25,French Foreign Policy Since 1945: An Introduction,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2017-02-13/french-foreign-policy-1945-introduction,French Foreign Policy Since 1945: An Introduction,"Bozo commands the details of his country’s foreign policy, and he never gets lost in them. French foreign policy, in his view, changes far less than the grand rhetorical declarations of successive presidents might lead one to expect. Beginning with President Charles de Gaulle in 1945, all French leaders have sought to manage the slow decline of France’s relative prestige and power in both Europe and the world. Accordingly, maintaining substantial military (especially nuclear) capabilities and a central role in the EU have remained constant priorities. Although Bozo dispels the illusion of powerful French presidents, his treatment relies heavily on a set of perceptions common among French foreign policy elites and so focuses on NATO security and nuclear policy to the exclusion of nearly everything else. A reader might thus never suspect that France pursues an active policy of military or economic intervention in Africa and the Middle East. Moreover, in an era of “soft” and economic power, French policies on trade, finance, immigration, development, culture, European enlargement, and East Asia go nearly unmentioned.

26,Charlemagne,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2017-02-13/charlemagne,Charlemagne,"Fried, one of Germany’s most distinguished historians, launches this grand biography with a disarming caveat: “The following book is not a novel, but it is a work of fiction all the same.” Fried believes that we are impossibly distant from those who inhabited Europe 1,200 years ago: we can hardly imagine their language, emotions, and beliefs—or even the “alien landscape” of impenetrable forests and deserted wastelands they inhabited. At this distance, historical biography can be no better than a rough approximation, even when the subject is the greatest European monarch of the era. Charlemagne united Europe for the first time since the fall of Rome, and the resulting Holy Roman Empire endured for a thousand years. His reforms of military logistics, money, law, and many other things changed Europe forever. Yet we know little about him with certainty. Much of what contemporary sources and subsequent historians reveal is probably romantic legend. The record is contradictory and thus open to interpretation, as befits a merciless conqueror who was canonized shortly after his death. For those who wish to grapple with Charlemagne’s life in its entirety, without false certainties, Fried’s book is the best choice."
27,Holocaust Angst: The Federal Republic of Germany and American Holocaust Memory Since the 1970s,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2017-02-13/holocaust-angst-federal-republic-germany-and-american-holocaust,Holocaust Angst: The Federal Republic of Germany and American Holocaust Memory Since the 1970s,"It is easy to forget that for decades after World War II, the Holocaust did not play anything like the role it does today in American culture. Beginning in the 1970s, mostly American Jewish activists sought to create more opportunities for Holocaust survivors to tell their stories and thus to bolster awareness of this singular event. Their campaign culminated in the construction of the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum on the Washington Mall, which officially opened in 1993. At the time, German leaders worried that the museum would cast present-day Germany in a bad light and threaten the transatlantic alliance—the angst of Eder’s title. The German government tried to convince the Holocaust Museum’s founders to acknowledge postwar Germany’s remarkably successful policies of democratization, reconciliation, and remembrance, as well as wartime German opposition to Hitler. Those efforts were completely rebuffed, but German fears proved to be exaggerated: the new museum conveyed a relatively balanced view, and Germany itself soon changed its policy, as symbolized by the construction of a striking Holocaust memorial near the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin. All of this reflects a broader process through which the Holocaust has been “universalized”: transformed from a specific event in Germany’s past into a stand-in for genocide anywhere."
28,Laid Low: Inside the Crisis That Overwhelmed Europe and the IMF,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2017-02-13/laid-low-inside-crisis-overwhelmed-europe-and-imf,Laid Low: Inside the Crisis That Overwhelmed Europe and the IMF,"Countless articles and books have analyzed the euro crisis, but until now, a serious treatment of the International Monetary Fund’s role in the crisis has been missing. Media reports often portray the IMF as filled with neoliberal ideologues who enthusiastically helped EU institutions and leaders impose harsh austerity policies and debt-repayment terms on southern European countries. In this authoritative and detailed account, Blustein marshals impressive research to rebut this view. He argues that the fund is home to sound technocrats who act independently and that, in addressing the euro crisis, IMF economists have proved more farsighted and able to learn from mistakes than national governments and have consistently advocated more balanced, less austere policies for Cyprus, Greece, Ireland, and Portugal, including debt rescheduling and the imposition of higher losses on foreign bondholders. Unfortunately, those proposals have been consistently overruled by European governments (which are overrepresented on the IMF’s board), sometimes rejected by the U.S. Treasury Department, and even shot down on occasion by southern European politicians who have sought to avoid short-term adjustment costs."
29,"Hitler: Ascent, 1889–1939",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2017-02-13/hitler-ascent-1889-1939,"Hitler: Ascent, 1889–1939","Is today’s right-wing populism comparable to the fascism of the 1930s? Many observers take comfort in the belief that times have changed so much that such an analogy is anachronistic. They point out that Adolf Hitler rose to power owing to the shock of the Great Depression, the harshness of the Treaty of Versailles, the menace of communist revolution, the legacy of anti-Semitism, and the fragility of Germany’s democratic norms—a perfect storm unlike anything before or since. In this biography, which covers the Nazi leader’s life up to the outbreak of war in 1939, Ullrich calls such complacency into question. Hitler is no anachronism; he is an eerily familiar figure: inexperienced, impulsive, ignorant, egomaniacal, petty, and resentful of established experts—yet gifted with an extraordinary theatrical talent for emotionally compelling, demagogic appeals to nativism. His opponents underestimated his political skill, viewing him as an incompetent bumbler and a temporary celebrity who could be easily tamed by the conservative establishment. As Hitler rose, his rivals waged internecine political squabbles—until it was too late to stop him. The material that Ullrich presents is hardly original, but his book nonetheless serves as an eloquent reminder of the adage that those who do not read history are doomed to repeat it."
30,Learning From Experience,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2017-02-13/learning-experience,Learning From Experience,"At a time of rapid change and upheaval in the United States, this short and engaging memoir by one of the most accomplished Americans of the last half century stands as a testament to the insights that a long life can provide. Shultz, now 96, served as President Richard Nixon’s secretary of labor, director of the Office of Management and Budget, and treasury secretary, and later served as secretary of state in the Reagan administration. In his book, he distills the basic lessons he learned during his decades in public service and in his private life and applies them to some of today’s challenges. Simple as his insights sound—always be learning, never compromise your basic principles just to keep a job, and so on—they are often profound and provocative. Surveying the troubled condition of the United States today, Shultz strikes a reassuringly hopeful note. “I remain a genuine optimist,” he writes in the final chapter, “even though we are surrounded by difficult problems and are not at the top of our game.” As the United States steps uncertainly into the Trump era, Shultz’s wisdom and counsel are more valuable, and more badly needed, than ever."

The quest for safety and predictability has made the country both more and less comfortable than before. Although many (perhaps even most) Americans enjoy the stability and security that the status quo provides, increasing numbers feel thwarted by the lack of opportunity and slow economic growth that characterize their increasingly static society. Others rejoice that their neighborhoods have not been disrupted by new highways and housing developments, but such “not in my backyard” stances create barriers to economic activity that reduce growth, depress wages, and eliminate jobs. The apparent stability of American society, Cowen believes, is an illusion: behind the placid façade, technological change and global competition have combined with domestic discontent to bring forth a new age of disruption—and, hopefully, renewal. For Cowen, a number of disparate events—from nationwide protests over police brutality to the election of Donald Trump as president—serve as signs that disruptive forces are gathering strength. Only time will tell whether they will yield benign or malignant effects."

Braut-Hegghammer has produced an insightful account of two cases of failure. Iraq might have achieved its nuclear ambitions had Saddam Hussein not started a fight with the West by invading Kuwait in 1990; he was forced to dismantle his nuclear facilities after the ensuing Gulf War. Libya, meanwhile, never made much headway, despite three decades of effort and considerable help from the illicit proliferation network run by the Pakistani physicist A.Q. Khan. The Libyans eventually abandoned their program as part of a broader rapprochement with the West. In both cases, the programs were chaotic and hampered by inadequate oversight and shifting priorities. Iraq’s program produced better results because the Iraqi government retained some capacity, whereas the Libyan dictator Muammar al-Qaddafi had deliberately dismantled his country’s state institutions. Braut-Hegghammer suggests that regardless of the importance that these autocrats attached to their nuclear programs, neither leader truly prioritized them—or even had much of a clue about how they were proceeding. The lesson for nonproliferation is that intentions often outstrip capabilities: whether a state can actually manage a complex nuclear program matters more than how much its leaders want one."

Crane was one such Cassandra; he was ignored by the Bush administration along with all the others. But in 2006, the Pentagon turned to Crane to help draft a new counterinsurgency manual for the U.S. Army and the Marines. The resulting text influenced the conduct of the so-called surge in Iraq that began the following year. Crane’s memoir includes a few too many reports of conferences and lists of their attendees, and the book’s discussion of military doctrine sometimes becomes abstruse. Yet Crane’s reflections deserve attention, for they illuminate the key questions of counterinsurgency with great lucidity. His book offers a rare account of how military bureaucracies debate strategy, along with plenty of good-sense suggestions that should guide future campaigns. It would be a shame if Crane became a Cassandra once more."

But the impression left by this history of the Pentagon’s Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, set up in 1958 largely to get a grip on the U.S. military’s space programs, is that many of its projects were delusional, wasteful, and at times downright dangerous. DARPA did play a role in some important developments, notably early research that led to the Internet, drones, and stealth bombers. But from the Vietnam War until the present, its leaders have tended to look for technical fixes to essentially political problems; the results have sometimes been disastrous, such as the use of Agent Orange in Vietnam. In a telling line, Weinberger notes that in recent years, DARPA’s “press releases tout devices that can help soldiers scale glass skyscrapers, while American forces fight in a country dominated by mud houses.” Her account is critical but not mocking; it is a well-researched contribution to the history of U.S. military technology."

MacArthur, as supreme commander of un forces in Korea, had added to his already awesome reputation with the boldest move of the campaign: the amphibious landing at Inchon. But he had also squandered the advantage he’d earned with that maneuver by pushing his luck. Driving forward to the Yalu River, he provoked China into intervening, a possibility that he had previously dismissed. As his forces were pushed back, he raised the stakes, urging that the United States and its allies should take the war to the Chinese. Truman’s patience had already been sorely tried by MacArthur’s condescension: when the president made a long journey to meet the general at Wake Island in the Pacific Ocean, MacArthur did not even bother to stay for lunch. With the stakes so high and the British fretting about a wider (and possibly nuclear) war, Truman decided he’d had enough of this “rank insubordination.” MacArthur still enjoyed great support from the American public, but not from his fellow generals. Brands’ book is not a revisionist account, and it skimps a bit on the wider context of the spat. But Brands is an accomplished storyteller and skillfully captures Truman’s seething irritation and MacArthur’s self-regard and almost comical grandiloquence."

She opens with the difficult decision that faced European royal families: Should they flee the approaching Nazis, decamping for London and leaving their people behind? Olson generally depicts the British establishment as classist, xenophobic, and inept. This was evident in the reluctance of the Royal Air Force to put Czech and Polish squadrons into the Battle of Britain—until there was no choice. Once in the fight, those squadrons performed magnificently. But she also reveals the imagination that went into making the BBC World Service a force for truth to combat Nazi propaganda. Olson’s account is sometimes superficial but never dull. Many moving stories and characters enliven the book, which succeeds in bringing to life the achievements of European patriots who fought on even when their cause appeared close to hopeless."

In this unusual book, Brekke applies economic concepts—supply and demand, public versus private goods, oligopoly versus free markets, and so on—to the provision of the religious services offered by several faiths. His main conclusion is that state support for particular religions—even indirect support, such as tax exemptions—is neither wise nor warranted. Far from promoting religious practice, it generally leads to a loss of public interest and also fosters rent seeking and even arbitrage by religious authorities."

The prize in economics was introduced with the support of Sveriges Riksbank, Sweden’s central bank, in 1969—seven decades later than the five prizes originally endowed by Alfred Nobel. According to Offer and Soderberg, the bank hoped to influence debate within Sweden over the future direction of the country’s social democracy by conferring on economics the status of a science. (The prize is officially called the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences.) The authors question this position on the grounds that modern economic theory is either untestable or, typically, persists despite frequent empirical refutations of its assumptions or predictions. Given this track record, they urge economists to be more humble when offering policy advice based on their ideas."

Contracts are not the only kinds of legal documents that have ballooned in this way: the median length of a U.S. Supreme Court decision has increased fourfold during the past 60 years. In this thought-provoking book, Hadfield argues that modern law has become too complicated, too costly, and too inflexible for a rapidly changing world. She attributes this rigidity to the fact that law is effectively monopolized by lawyers and argues that nonlawyers should be able to compete to provide certain legal services. Australia and the United Kingdom have already begun to move in that direction, in the belief that opening up the law will foster badly needed innovation."

The authors of this sobering book argue the contrary: innovation—by which they mean the commercialization of new discoveries, not the discoveries themselves—is slowing down, mainly because Western societies have become sclerotic. Corporations have grown more risk averse, owing to three factors: their increased reliance on financial markets (as opposed to internal funding), a shift in the corporate world from entrepreneurship to rent seeking, and the growth in complex and continually changing government regulations. Erixon and Weigel take aim in particular at the so-called precautionary principle, which holds that companies must prove that their products or practices are not harmful before they can bring them to the market. This approach is common in Europe, where, the authors contend, it severely penalizes risk taking and flies in the face of the eu’s official goal of encouraging innovation."

Heal persuasively argues that these agendas are not in conflict at all, and he crafts an excellent overview of the economic case for protecting the environment. First, significant climate change will make economic development more difficult on several fronts. Second, technical advances have made alternative sources of energy increasingly competitive—and more progress is on the way, particularly when it comes to the storage of electricity. Finally, if governments began to properly price environmental assets—for example, charging firms for permission to emit greenhouse gases—they could raise a great deal of revenue that, properly employed, would enhance development. All around the world, societies need to seriously alter their economic behaviors to prevent the worst-case climate scenarios. But such changes need not come at the expense of growth."

In this spirited and contrarian book, Klaas makes the case for pushing back against this global authoritarian tide. He does not defend the West’s many botched efforts at democracy promotion or the misuse of military intervention; instead he argues that the core of Western strategy should be confronting despots rather than seeking pragmatic accommodations with them. Such compromises have led to what he calls “the Saudi Arabia effect,” as the United States and other liberal states cozy up to nondemocratic regimes in the name of geostrategic expediency, only to find themselves one step removed from the role of an active accomplice in oppression. He also warns against “the Madagascar effect,” which finds Western governments setting extremely low standards for “counterfeit democracies” so that they can justify working with them, which is what happened in the wake of the rigged elections held after a 2013 coup in Madagascar. He concedes that the short-term costs of confronting despots are real but maintains that doing so yields long-term strategic and moral gains."

Stuenkel pokes holes in those accounts, showing that concepts such as religious freedom, human rights, and sovereignty have never been exclusively Western inventions; they were hammered out over centuries with contributions from African, Asian, and Middle Eastern societies. He argues that scholars should challenge Western-centric interpretations because they make the United States and European countries more suspicious of rising non-Western states and reluctant to share power with them, which Stuenkel thinks is unwise. If modernity is seen not as a Western gift to the world but as a global project with many sources of inspiration, the struggle between the West and “the rest” will be seen for what it really is: not a contest between deep values and philosophies of order but rather an organic evolution of world politics in which power, authority, status, and privilege are redistributed to make the existing order more fair and functional."
45,The Return of History,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2017-02-13/return-history,The Return of History,"Just two decades ago, Western ideals seemed to be sweeping the world, as a succession of countries transitioned to democracy, liberal internationalism flourished, and thinkers hailed “the end of history.” But as Welsh vividly chronicles, history has come back with a vengeance. Her book catalogs many of the things that have “returned” from the past: barbarism, mass refugee flows, confrontation between Russia and the West, growing economic inequality. But by spending most of her time contrasting today’s realities with the optimistic visions that took hold in the immediate post–Cold War moment, Welsh has rigged the game. Liberal democracy’s ascendance has unfolded over two centuries, not two decades. And from the beginning, it has been a tale full of contingencies, setbacks, crises, and lucky breaks. Still, Welsh reminds readers that liberal democratic advances can be reversed and that large (and perhaps growing) constituencies inside and outside the West now favor autocratic nationalism and illiberalism. For liberal democracy to regain its luster, its advocates must craft new narratives about its struggles, failures, accomplishments, and enduring principles."

He highlights growing anxiety about poverty, unemployment, inequality, and the extreme concentration of wealth and laments that Western governments seem incapable of developing more socially and economically inclusive growth models. At each turn, Dervis looks for possibilities for reform through tax policy, regulation, and social spending. If the technology-driven growth that has propelled the global economy forward for the last century is now ending, as Robert Gordon and other economists argue, then the prospects for progress are grim. Dervis is less pessimistic, however, and he pins his hopes on a renaissance in democratic institutions and revitalized social contracts. For Dervis, progress has not ended. Rather, understandings of progress must change to allow for forms of economic development that are more sustainable and equitable. He makes a convincing case for reform, but he does not answer a significant question: Where are the reformers?"

This illuminating book’s core insight is that modern democracy emerged less as a fulfillment of timeless values than as a “bargain” between rulers and the ruled, struck in the shadow of war. Ferejohn and Rosenbluth argue that modern democracy took root because the appeal of nationalism proved sufficiently potent to rally public support for war but not strong enough to let governments ignore the growing demands of the working classes that had formed during the Industrial Revolution. The book begins with fascinating chapters about war and democracy in classical Athens and Rome; later chapters explore the nineteenth century’s grand armies and the emergence of “total war” in the twentieth century, which had profound effects on the expansion of democratic life in the West. The very different pathways traveled by the Soviet Union, Nazi Germany, and imperial Japan reveal the highly contingent and fragile nature of the democratic impulse."

Until then, only the U.S. dollar, the euro, the British pound, and the Japanese yen had enjoyed this exalted status. The addition of the renminbi to the SDR basket occasioned much celebration in China. Lu Jian, vice president of the Guangdong Guangken Rubber Group, hailed the event as a “historic moment.” The People’s Bank of China (PBOC), the country’s central bank, announced that the move was “an affirmation of the success of China’s economic development and results of the reform and opening up of the financial sector.” As far as many Chinese were concerned, the IMF’s move signaled that the renminbi had become a leading global currency, befitting one of the world’s leading economies."

For anyone paying attention to the civil war in Syria—as well as to the festering conflicts in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, and Yemen—it was clear that the crisis had been a long time coming. Yet the arrival of so many, and in so chaotic and desperate a manner, caught European policymakers off-guard. As more than one million people entered Europe, primarily by crossing the Mediterranean, the fabled solidarity underpinning the European project began to crumble. As some governments scrambled to construct makeshift reception centers in resorts and army barracks, others looked on with indifference, and still more did so with alarm. European politicians turned on one another, blaming those who had failed to manage their borders, those who had supposedly encouraged migrants with their hospitality, and those who had done nothing at all."

ICANN is the nonprofit that performs the small but significant function of governing the Internet’s system of website and domain names—managing its address book, so to speak. The Internet began as a project of the U.S. Department of Defense in the 1960s, and since its creation in the late 1990s, ICANN had remained under U.S. supervision.

Democrats and Republicans have reached across the aisle, compelled by a shared recognition that flawed legal codes and sentencing laws (among other features of the criminal justice system) have destroyed lives, drained billions of taxpayer dollars, and failed to provide Americans with the public safety they deserve. This broad agreement led to the introduction, in 2015 and 2016, of bipartisan legislation in the U.S. Congress that would have produced comprehensive reform at the federal level—including changes to mandatory minimum sentencing laws, which have contributed to the explosion in U.S. incarceration rates by reducing judges’ discretion in sentencing. Supporters of the legislation represented an extraordinarily wide ideological spectrum: from Speaker of the House Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, former Speaker Newt Gingrich of Georgia, and the billionaire donor Charles Koch on the right to President Barack Obama, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), and the philanthropist George Soros’ Open Society Foundations on the left."

And in July, Mohamed Lahouaiej Bouhlel drove a truck through a Bastille Day celebration in Nice, killing 86 people.  The attacks by the San Bernardino killers, Mateen, and Bouhlel followed an increasingly common pattern: the Islamic State (also known as ISIS) claimed credit for them, but the perpetrators appear to have planned and executed their operations alone."

Images of Chinese people overwhelmingly involve economics or politics: massive cities sprouting up, diligent workers laboring in vast factories, nouveaux riches flaunting their wealth, farmers toiling in polluted fields, dissidents languishing in prison. The stories about faith in China that do exist tend to involve victims, such as Chinese Christians forced to worship underground or groups such as Falun Gong being repressed by the government."
57,Asia’s Other Revisionist Power,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/asia/2017-02-13/asias-other-revisionist-power,Asia’s Other Revisionist Power,"Donald Trump’s election as U.S. president threatens to upend the world’s most important bilateral relationship. On the campaign trail, Trump promised to label China a currency manipulator and to respond to its “theft of American trade secrets” and “unfair subsidy behavior” by levying a 45 percent tariff on Chinese exports. As president-elect, he reversed four decades of U.S. policy when he spoke by telephone with Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen and declared that the United States was not bound by the “one China” policy, the diplomatic understanding that has underpinned Washington’s approach to Beijing since 1979."
58,How America Lost Faith in Expertise,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2017-02-13/how-america-lost-faith-expertise,How America Lost Faith in Expertise,"In 2014, following the Russian invasion of Crimea, The Washington Post published the results of a poll that asked Americans about whether the United States should intervene militarily in Ukraine. Only one in six could identify Ukraine on a map; the median response was off by about 1,800 miles. But this lack of knowledge did not stop people from expressing pointed views. In fact, the respondents favored intervention in direct proportion to their ignorance. Put another way, the people who thought Ukraine was located in Latin America or Australia were the most enthusiastic about using military force there."
59,Trump and World Order,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/world/2017-02-13/trump-and-world-order,Trump and World Order,"Since the administration of Franklin Roosevelt, 13 successive U.S. presidents have agreed that the United States must assume the mantle of global leadership. Although foreign policy varied from president to president, all sent the clear message that the country stood for more than just its own well-being and that the world economy was not a zero-sum game."
60,Trump and North Korea,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2017-02-13/trump-and-north-korea,Trump and North Korea,"In the next four years, North Korea is poised to cross a dangerous threshold by finally developing the capability to hit the continental United States with a nuclear missile. That ability would present a direct threat to the United States and could punch a hole in the U.S. nuclear umbrella in Asia: Japan and South Korea, doubtful that Washington would risk U.S. cities to defend Tokyo or Seoul, might feel they had no choice but to get their own nuclear bombs. U.S. President Donald Trump, while still president-elect, drew a redline at Pyongyang’s feet, tweeting, “It won’t happen!” But the real question is how to stop it."
61,Trump and the Holy Land,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/israel/2017-02-13/trump-and-holy-land,Trump and the Holy Land,"Every U.S. president since Harry Truman has sought peace between Israel and its Arab neighbors. Every president since Lyndon Johnson has opposed the building of Jewish settlements on land that Israel occupied in June 1967 and has supported a diplomatic solution by which the Jewish state would trade much of that land for a secure and lasting peace. And every president since Bill Clinton has worked for a two-state solution under which Israel would enjoy security and genuine acceptance in the Middle East and the Palestinians would run their own affairs and prosper in a viable, independent state."
62,Trump and the Economy,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2017-02-13/trump-and-economy,Trump and the Economy,"The central economic goal of Donald Trump’s administration will be to boost U.S. economic growth. Steven Mnuchin, Trump’s nominee for treasury secretary, has said that the administration’s objective is to raise the rate of GDP growth to three to four percent, doubling the rate achieved over the last decade. This will be accomplished by establishing a globally competitive corporate tax rate, adopting a territorial corporate tax system, reducing excessive regulation, boosting domestic energy production, and introducing better trade policies."
63,Trump and Russia,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/russian-federation/2017-02-13/trump-and-russia,Trump and Russia,"Relations between the United States and Russia are broken, and each side has a vastly different assessment of what went wrong. U.S. officials point to the Kremlin’s annexation of Crimea and the bloody covert war Russian forces are waging in eastern Ukraine. They note the Kremlin’s suppression of civil society at home, its reckless brandishing of nuclear weapons, and its military provocations toward U.S. allies and partners in Europe. They highlight Russia’s military intervention in Syria aimed at propping up Bashar al-Assad’s brutal dictatorship. And they call attention to an unprecedented attempt through a Kremlin-backed hacking and disinformation campaign to interfere with the U.S. presidential election last November."
64,Trump and Terrorism,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2017-02-13/trump-and-terrorism,Trump and Terrorism,"The United States will soon reach a crossroads in its struggle against terrorism. The international coalition fighting the Islamic State (also known as ISIS) has driven the group out of much of the territory it once held and, sooner or later, will militarily defeat it by destroying its core in Iraq and Syria. But military victory over ISIS will not end the global war on terrorism that the United States has waged since 9/11. Some of ISIS’ provinces may outlive its core. Remnants of the caliphate may morph into an insurgency. Al Qaeda and its affiliates will still pose a threat. Moreover, the conditions that breed jihadist organizations will likely persist across the greater Middle East. So the United States must decide what strategy to pursue in the next stage of the war on terrorism."
65,Trump and China,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2017-02-13/trump-and-china,Trump and China,"In recent years, China has started throwing its weight around. It has defied international law and risked violent clashes in the East China and South China Seas. It has bent trade rules by discriminating against foreign businesses to help its own. It has tried to shut out foreign influences while promoting its own propaganda abroad. And it has resisted Western demands that it put more pressure on its ally North Korea. China’s new assertiveness stems, in part, from its growing power; the country now boasts the world’s second-largest economy and its second-largest military budget. But domestic insecurities have also played a role. Slowing growth in an economy burdened by high levels of debt and accelerating capital flight have made Chinese President Xi Jinping increasingly anxious about internal threats, from popular protest to splits in the ruling Communist Party. In response, he has flexed the country’s muscles abroad to play to nationalist fervor at home, while cracking down on any hint of domestic dissent."
66,The Jacksonian Revolt,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2017-01-20/jacksonian-revolt,The Jacksonian Revolt,"For the first time in 70 years, the American people have elected a president who disparages the policies, ideas, and institutions at the heart of postwar U.S. foreign policy. No one knows how the foreign policy of the Trump administration will take shape, or how the new president’s priorities and preferences will shift as he encounters the torrent of events and crises ahead. But not since Franklin Roosevelt’s administration has U.S. foreign policy witnessed debates this fundamental."

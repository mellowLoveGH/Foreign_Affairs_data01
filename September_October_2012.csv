1,Arms Away,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2012-08-18/arms-away,Arms Away,"Over the last two decades, the United States has enjoyed an unrivaled competitive advantage in the production and export of advanced conventional weaponry. The collapse of the Soviet Union and the breakup of the Warsaw Pact led to sharp reductions in Russian defense spending and a drop in Moscow's arms transfers to regional allies. Simultaneously, globalization rewarded firms with economies of scale, allowing U.S. defense contractors to capitalize on their size and on large orders from armed forces around the globe. The formula for success was simple: by producing a range of affordable yet sophisticated weapons, the Pentagon and its contractors would crush any rivals. Domination of the global arms trade, and the economic and geopolitical benefits that came with it, was the United States' to lose."
2,The Rise of Settler Terrorism,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/israel/2012-08-18/rise-settler-terrorism,The Rise of Settler Terrorism,"Late this past June, a group of Israeli settlers in the West Bank defaced and burned a mosque in the small West Bank village of Jabaa. Graffiti sprayed by the vandals warned of a ""war"" over the planned evacuation, ordered by the Israeli Supreme Court, of a handful of houses illegally built on private Palestinian land near the Israeli settlement of Beit El. The torching of the mosque was the fourth such attack in 18 months and part of a wider trend of routine violence committed by radical settlers against innocent Palestinians, Israeli security personnel, and mainstream settler leaders -- all aimed at intimidating perceived enemies of the settlement project."
3,Bucking Beijing,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2012-08-18/bucking-beijing,Bucking Beijing,"In contrast to its Cold War strategy of containment, Washington's current approach to China is not the product of a deliberate planning process. It is nowhere codified in official documents. Indeed, it does not even have a name. Still, for the better part of two decades, the United States has pursued a broadly consistent two-pronged strategy combining engagement and balancing."
4,Johnson the Power Broker,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/review-essay/2012-09-01/johnson-power-broker,Johnson the Power Broker,"The fourth installment in a planned five-volume biography of Lyndon Johnson is vintage Robert Caro: enormously detailed, personality driven, power obsessed. The book begins with Johnson riding high as majority leader in the U.S. Senate during the 1950s, then follows him as he crashes to earth as vice president, shorn of power and, in power's absence, self-respect. Caro lingers on every embarrassment of the vice presidency, a period of humiliation for Johnson that ended only when President John F. Kennedy was killed and Johnson ascended to the Oval Office."
5,Latin Lessons,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/review-essay/2012-09-01/latin-lessons,Latin Lessons,"In June, as the U.S. Supreme Court ruled on Arizona's controversial immigration law and the Obama administration announced a significant change in U.S. deportation policies, the country's roughly 50 million Latino residents were once again transformed from a diverse collection of individuals into an ethnic bloc and then into a political issue in the 2012 campaign season. It was hardly the first time, and it will certainly not be the last, as the U.S. government and American society and political culture struggle to make sense of the country's rapidly shifting demographics."

7,"Government, Geography, and Growth",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/review-essay/2012-08-16/government-geography-and-growth,"Government, Geography, and Growth","According to the economist Daron Acemoglu and the political scientist James Robinson, economic development hinges on a single factor: a country's political institutions. More specifically, as they explain in their new book, Why Nations Fail, it depends on the existence of ""inclusive"" political institutions, defined as pluralistic systems that protect individual rights. These, in turn, give rise to inclusive economic institutions, which secure private property and encourage entrepreneurship. The long-term result is higher incomes and improved human welfare."
8,The Scottish Play,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-kingdom/2012-09-01/scottish-play,The Scottish Play,"The monument to Sir William Wallace stands near the city of Stirling, a castle town not far from the Scottish capital of Edinburgh. On blustery days when the sun peeks through the clouds, the sandstone memorial glows golden and majestic. That is exactly the effect its Victorian-era creators intended: a tower of imagined antiquity meant to evoke the spirit of a freedom-loving Scot. In the late thirteenth century, Wallace helped lead an uprising against England's King Edward I, for which he was eventually hanged, drawn, and quartered. There are no contemporary images of the hero depicted in the 1995 epic Braveheart, but when tourism began to boom after the film came out, enthusiasts made up their own. Until a few years ago, a bas-relief panel introduced the warrior-martyr to tour groups visiting the tower as they walked from the parking lot to the gift shop. The likeness was unmistakably that of Mel Gibson."
9,The Crisis of Europe,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/europe/2012-08-16/crisis-europe,The Crisis of Europe,"May 10, 1943: German forces are destroying the Warsaw ghetto. Facing armed resistance from Polish Jewish fighters, they set fire to it house by house, burning some inhabitants alive and driving others out from the cellars. ""Today, in sum 1,183 Jews were apprehended alive,"" notes the official report by the SS commander Jürgen Stroop. ""187 Jews and bandits were shot. An indeterminable number of Jews and bandits were destroyed in blown-up bunkers. The total number of Jews processed so far has risen to 52,683."" An appendix to this document contains the now-famous photograph of a terrified small boy in an outsize cloth cap, his hands held high in surrender. Marek Edelman, one of very few leaders of the Warsaw ghetto uprising to survive, concluded a memoir published immediately after the war with these words: ""Those who were killed in action had done their duty to the end, to the last drop of blood that soaked into the pavements. . . . We, who did not perish, leave it up to you to keep the memory of them alive -- forever."""
10,How China Sees America,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2012-08-16/how-china-sees-america,How China Sees America,"Great power"" is a vague term, but China deserves it by any measure: the extent and strategic location of its territory, the size and dynamism of its population, the value and growth rate of its economy, the massive size of its share of global trade, and the strength of its military. China has become one of a small number of countries that have significant national interests in every part of the world and that command the attention, whether willingly or grudgingly, of every other country and every international organization. And perhaps most important, China is the only country widely seen as a possible threat to U.S. predominance. Indeed, China's rise has led to fears that the country will soon overwhelm its neighbors and one day supplant the United States as a global hegemon."
11,Cybersecurity and U.S.-China Relations,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2012-08-20/cybersecurity-and-us-china-relations,Cybersecurity and U.S.-China Relations,"This report considers how hacking, cyber-espionage, and the threat of cyberwarfare affect U.S.-Chinese relations. Americans hear more about Chinese threats to the United States than vice versa, but it is likely that U.S. private and government actors are probing China’s Internet as much or more than the Chinese are probing that of the United States. And in cyberspace, the advantage goes to the offense. On key issues relating to the Internet, Chinese and U.S. interests are fundamentally opposed. The United States favors information freedom, whereas China’s regime relies on control. The U.S. military operates on cybernetworks, whereas the Chinese quest for asymmetric strategies requires the capability to take such networks down. Even dialogue, which Lieberthal and Singer advocate as a first step in a long march, will be a challenge, given the diffusion of control over the Internet within each society. Moreover, one wonders whether even two such important powers can do much to enhance cyber-security when potential attackers are globally dispersed and often private.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

Among the main findings and conclusions are the following: Asia’s share of Latin American trade surged to 21 percent in 2011, second only to the United States’, which was 34 percent; Asian investments in Latin America, although rising, are lagging relative to the growth of Asian–Latin American trade; and the two emerging regions could benefit from sharing development experiences in areas such as export promotion, poverty reduction, natural-disaster mitigation, and financial regulation. Indicating the high degree of transpacific dynamism, the study records 18 current interregional free-trade agreements and 12 more in the pipeline. To attract more high-quality Asian investment and technology, Latin American countries, the authors urge, should continue to liberalize their regulatory policies, upgrade their infrastructure, and invest in international education. Brief but illuminating case studies describe promising investments by large Latin American firms targeting growing Asian markets in food distribution, wind power generation, and iron and steel.

Ethiopia was one of the very first recipients of American assistance, beginning in 1951 under the administration of President Harry Truman. McVety deftly links foreign aid to Enlightenment ideals and to classical economics. The book really picks up steam when she describes the diplomatic wrangling that took place right after World War II between an American elite learning to flex its global muscles and an Ethiopian leader, Haile Selassie, who skillfully combined personal charisma, pleading, and threats to win a large infusion of American capital and technical assistance, which he hoped would help modernize Ethiopia and maintain his own power. McVety’s book ends a bit abruptly and says unfortunately little about the equally interesting post-Selassie period. Meles Zenawi, Ethiopia’s current strongman, has proved to be an excellent pupil of the Selassie approach to donors: Ethiopia today receives more than $3 billion a year in foreign aid.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."
14,Being Nuclear: Africans and the Global Uranium Trade,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2012-08-20/being-nuclear-africans-and-global-uranium-trade,Being Nuclear: Africans and the Global Uranium Trade,"Beginning with the observation that the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima was made with uranium from a mine in what was then the Belgian Congo, Hecht explores the role of Africa in the development of military and civilian nuclear energy since World War II. The book is occasionally marred by Hecht’s academic rhetoric, such as her repeated references to the state of “nuclearity” that African states have achieved through the global uranium trade. Still, it sheds light on a strategically crucial market controlled by a small number of powerful states. In the postwar era, Western nuclear powers agreed on the need to ensure a steady supply of uranium and, at the same time, prevent nuclear proliferation. Still, uranium caused disputes within and among countries, pitting producers, who wanted the element to be treated like any other commodity, against foreign policy establishments, which sought to regulate it more closely. Hecht provides fascinating details about apartheid South Africa’s nuclear ambitions and also considers the shameful manner in which African governments and international companies downplayed the extent of the radiation risks posed by uranium to generations of African miners.

But Yates’ book fills in some gaps in the story with insightful details. Yates focuses on the oil sector in central Africa and has more to say about Francophone countries, such as Chad, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Gabon, than about Anglophone producers, such as Nigeria and Ghana. He shows how oil wealth creates incentives to amass power and thus motivates political infighting in these countries. Leaders such as President Denis Sassou-Nguesso of the Republic of the Congo have used their countries’ oil wealth to build enormous personal fortunes and buy the support of political allies and the military. Meanwhile, the vast majority of people in these countries have benefited shockingly little. Yates’ final chapter is a useful survey of potential solutions to this sad reality. The most interesting approach he describes is the distribution of oil revenues directly to the population, which would bypass corrupt state officials. Getting such officials to agree, of course, would likely prove rather difficult. Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

Kennedy. But Rasenberger’s real culprit is American political culture, with its paradoxical combination of hubris and insecurity, which simply could not tolerate sharing a hemisphere with an insubordinate Cuba. He depicts the early Kennedy White House as inexperienced yet headstrong, shockingly disorganized, driven by excessive testosterone and cynical self-interest. Yet Rasenberger also puts forward the novel theory that, whether through luck or calculation, the outcome for Kennedy was fortuitous: the failed invasion disposed of the pesky Cuban exiles and avoided the high costs of an American occupation. In the aftermath, the Kennedy White House became better organized and brilliantly handled the 1962 Cuban missile crisis. Nevertheless, the author asserts, “the best and the brightest” failed to question basic precepts of American interests and power and thus repeated many of the same errors, on a much larger scale, in Vietnam.

Ciravegna asks whether since then, the Central American country has developed its own domestic information technology cluster. His answer: yes and no. Costa Rica now boasts about 200 local information technology firms, and some 40 multinational corporations have established a presence there. But most of the local firms provide low-tech services, and many of the multinational technology companies have set up only back-office services and call centers rather than production facilities or research labs. Ciravegna argues that unlike the successful high-tech sectors that exist in India, Israel, and Taiwan, the high-tech sector in Costa Rica has few links to the kinds of diaspora communities and social networks that could bind it to flagship multinationals based in the United States. He offers various practical approaches to establishing the necessary transnational ties and innovation networks, such as assisting Costa Ricans to study abroad, offering more postgraduate programs for foreign students in engineering and computer science, and capitalizing on the nation’s tourism destinations to attract international technology fairs.

The book’s main character is a young boy who escaped from Kony’s army and is now in a rehabilitation center. Abandoned by his relatives, the boy has few prospects and multiple murders on his conscience. Jagielski tells the story in an affecting manner, although he offers no new insights into the methods Kony’s officers use to transform young boys and girls into killers. He is more interested in describing how the conflict has destroyed the sense of community in a desperately poor region and perverted the relationships between children and adults. He also reflects on the highly ambiguous nature of the conflict, suggesting some degree of complicity between the Ugandan army and officers in Kony’s group and tracing the hostility of northern populations toward the regime of President Yoweri Museveni to its roots in the 1980s, when Museveni came to power and repressed the remaining pockets of support in the north for the previous regime.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

In El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras, local capitalists have conspired to keep taxes low and regressive, preventing their governments from meeting basic responsibilities. Nevertheless, as Schneider shows, each country has its own particular story. In El Salvador, a relatively forward-looking and unified business class has abided a number of significant tax increases, whereas in Guatemala, ferociously reactionary and fragmented elites have made sure their tax rates remain among the lowest in the hemisphere. Part of the problem is the openness of these small economies and the mobility of capital, both of which put pressure on the governments to offer tax concessions to footloose investors. Another problem is the apparent unwillingness or inability of privileged families to extend their allegiances beyond their immediate circles to the broader national community. Schneider hopes the middle and popular classes in all three countries will mobilize on behalf of more egalitarian fiscal policies and stronger states capable of implementing shared national compacts. Such revised states might be drawn closer to their more prosperous neighbor, Costa Rica, which benefits from relatively well-established institutions and a firmer commitment to social democracy.

20,War and Conflict in Africa,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2012-08-20/war-and-conflict-africa,War and Conflict in Africa,"Why has Africa experienced so many armed conflicts since the end of the Cold War? Williams rejects monocausal arguments in this very readable synthesis of the literature on civil wars in the region since 1990. He also argues for a clear distinction between underlying factors that make conflict more likely (such as poor governance by African regimes, contests over natural resources, and the ethnic and religious heterogeneity of African societies) and trigger factors that push specific actors to violence (such as miscalculation, greed, or personal ambition). Williams takes a rather pessimistic view of international responses to conflict in the region, such as the creation of conflict-prevention organizations, peacekeeping missions, and power-sharing peace deals. He views these efforts as typically underfunded, ill timed, or not well suited to the dynamics of the actual conflicts. Equipped with an impressive command of the different struggles that have ravaged the region, Williams has written a superb overview of this complex subject without resorting to academic jargon. It deserves to be read by novices and specialists alike. Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

Pavel Vidal Alejandro expertly unravels the distortions caused by the dual currency system and calls for a gradual transition to a single, devalued Cuban peso. Armando Nova González and Anicia García Alvarez document Cuba’s disastrous agricultural sector and recommend strengthening property rights and creating market incentives to stimulate farm output. Drawing on opinion surveys, one of the book’s editors, Espina Prieto, brilliantly smashes the myth that Cuba is a frozen-in-time society, revealing dynamic social mobility and changing values. Mindful that Cuba is a small island economy, Pérez Villanueva and Pedro Monreal González suggest realistic ways for the country to take better advantage of foreign investment and international value chains. As a whole, the essays in this book suggest that Cuba must replace its stagnant economic management with a more modern regime built around a smarter state, refined regulation, and targeted social welfare programs.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."
22,Social Protest and Contentious Authoritarianism in China,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2012-08-20/social-protest-and-contentious-authoritarianism-china,Social Protest and Contentious Authoritarianism in China,"This book puts forward a novel theory of social protest in a transitional authoritarian regime. Chen argues that contradictions between the ruling Chinese Communist Party’s ideology and its governance, along with changes in the country’s political and economic institutions, have provided more opportunities for ordinary Chinese citizens to press for their demands directly with the government. The party pays lip service to popular sovereignty and “rule according to law.” But its behavior denies both, thus legitimizing and fueling protest. The dismantling of official agricultural communes and many state-owned enterprises in the 1980s and 1990s has left local governments as the only place where aggrieved individuals can seek redress. Chen demonstrates that protesters get their way by adopting more confrontational tactics. But China’s rulers need not worry about a revolution, because social protest and official responses appear to have settled into an uneasy equilibrium, which Chen terms “contentious authoritarianism.” Within this equilibrium, protesters use the most effective tactics to gain concessions from pragmatic officials who choose to be flexible enough to respond to their demands. The author seems to suggest, provocatively, that low-intensity social conflict may function like a pressure valve mitigating more lethal systemic risks -- an argument sure to stimulate more debate and research.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."
23,The Patagonian Hare: A Memoir,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2012-08-20/patagonian-hare-memoir,The Patagonian Hare: A Memoir,"Most people never find anything serious about which to obsess. Lanzmann's early life suggested he would be no exception. Born in Paris in 1925 to Jewish parents, he joined the antifascist resistance as a teenager, served as Jean-Paul Sartre's right-hand man at Les Temps Modernes, spent years as Simone de Beauvoir's quasi-marital lover, and became a partisan in the politics of the French left. Noble causes all, but they amounted to little more than an evanescent dilettantism of a distinctively Parisian variety. Then, Lanzmann found his obsession: the Holocaust. This stream-of-consciousness autobiography describes -- in excessive detail for most non-French readers -- how gossipy and trivial Lanzmann's life had become, and then how the rediscovery of his Jewish heritage restored its focus. His 1985 film about the Holocaust, Shoah, was immediately hailed as a masterpiece. Nearly ten hours in length, it offers not only a fastidiously detailed history of Nazi extermination but also a remarkable innovation in documentary filmmaking. The film eschewed photos and films of the camps, relying instead on oral testimony, often with eyewitnesses (prisoners and guards alike) reenacting past events. On the surface, it is an understated, even bland mode of documentary. But it reveals layers of obsession: an obsessed director telling the stories of those obsessed with telling their stories."

So one might be tempted to ignore a 400-page book written in midstream, most of which concerns the period -- long ago, it seems -- when Silvio Berlusconi still headed Italy, Nicolas Sarkozy still led France, and Greece still seemed salvageable. Yet Bastasin’s book is worth reading for its detailed political narrative of the crisis to date, drawn largely from journalistic sources and focusing on the interaction among decision-makers in Europe’s capitals. Bastasin is unsentimental and rightly rejects simplistic narratives that blame the crisis solely on fiscal profligacy, easygoing cultures, or corruption in Mediterranean countries. He highlights subtler factors, such as the advantages the single currency has afforded German lenders and exporters. In the end, however, Bastasin indulges in some federalist sentiments. The euro should be maintained, he urges, by surrendering outdated national identities and embracing cosmopolitan political solidarity -- a solution that seems neither technocratically appropriate nor politically feasible.

They leave it to social scientists such as Jacobs to tackle important issues that are too diffuse or complex to explain in a stump speech or a newspaper article. Many tough problems facing modern democracies require that immediate pain be inflicted on citizens in exchange for broader, long-term benefits. Jacobs argues that in order to succeed in managing these “intertemporal policy choices,” politicians must surmount three political challenges: focusing the attention of voters, correctly predicting positive long-term trends, and committing to policy solutions even when they are opposed by influential interest groups. To simplify a complex argument, Jacobs is a Goldilocks democrat: only governments that are neither too populist nor too insulated can create and maintain fair long-term policies. This book contains much sound and detailed policy advice drawn from detailed case studies of policymaking in Canada, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States, especially with regard to pension reform. Yet Jacobs’ insightful analysis can also be applied to debt reduction, global warming, education, immigration, and many other controversial issues.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

But this book presents research from a subfield of linguistics called politeness studies, which analyzes and compares such rules within and across societies. Chapters on China, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, and Vietnam show how terms of address, verb forms, pronouns, and honorifics vary depending on situations and relationships. The societies do not differ much in the cultural values that politeness expresses, such as seniority, reciprocity, humility, and conflict avoidance. But there are such big differences in how they are expressed that even small deviations mark a speaker either as a foreigner or as someone who wants to resist mainstream values. Nevertheless, in all five countries, one universal principle underlies the fine-grained distinctions on which courtesy rests: politeness is used to express, reinforce, or contest power relationships.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

She advocates protecting headscarves by enforcing a right to personal religious choice. The European Court of Human Rights should be more consistently secular in its jurisprudence, she argues, particularly as applied to Muslim symbols, adding that attempts to ban headscarves rest on prejudice and misunderstanding. The real and often silent victims of a ban, she claims, are women who freely choose the head-scarf and must thus endure the “social tragedy” of isolation. Other unintended consequences, she maintains -- without much empirical evidence -- include the de facto exclusion of Muslim women from the workplace and the encouragement of religious fundamentalism. In most Western countries, the headscarf question (at least concerning adults) has been all but resolved in favor of Elver’s position, with the debate now largely restricted to more extreme forms of traditional religious dress, such as the burqa and the niqab, which conceal nearly the entire body. The book provides an insightful perspective on this trend, grounded more in constitutional law than empirical sociology or political history.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

As a businessman, intellectual, moderate politician, unconverted Jew, and perhaps also gay man, he symbolizes the progressive forces that eventually failed to block the Nazi cataclysm. Much has been written about him, but Volkov’s short biography focuses uniquely on Rathenau’s inner ambivalence and conflict. His arrogant, distant, contradictory, and meddling persona triggered vicious hatred but also fascinated great novelists, such as Robert Musil. In his public writings and speeches, Rathenau criticized capitalists, Jews, partisan politicians, nationalists, and modern artists, yet in his private life, he cultivated and emulated them. Volkov believes Rathenau’s inner turmoil stemmed largely from his Jewishness, which set him apart. Yet perhaps Volkov underestimates how much Rathenau was a man of his times. With so many social conflicts swirling about, anyone who sought to reconcile and reform the disparate elements of German society was destined to become a man with too many qualities.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

American decline is well under way, he argues, and the odds for a reversal of fortune are perhaps lower than Americans would like. On the one hand, Luce sees an inexorably rising China, which even according to conservative projections may have a GDP that is 25 percent bigger than that of the United States by 2030. On the other, Luce sees a United States that cannot reform. Tea Party fervor ensures that the GOP will be strong enough and conservative enough to block needed change. President Barack Obama, in Luce’s view, lacks the political drive and skills to push the GOP back. Most fundamentally, Luce fears that the United States no longer knows how to promote the prosperity of the American middle class.

Today, the country is stuck. The parties are deadlocked, the police and the courts are ineffective, and the bureaucracy is corrupt. Despite an agreement to merge forces, the army and the insurgents sit in separate camps, poised to resume fighting. A promised new constitution is overdue. The rural poverty, bonded-labor practices, and social and political exclusion of ethnic and caste minorities that sparked the insurgency remain unaddressed. Some benefit was gained from international aid efforts and two now-terminated UN missions, one focused on human rights and the other on peace monitoring -- but not enough to create momentum. Nepal’s giant neighbors, China and India, contend for strategic position with little concern for Nepal’s complex internal problems. The book’s deeply informed contributors from the diplomatic, nongovernmental organization, academic, and journalistic worlds look hard for rays of hope, but they find few.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

Over the last two generations, recruitment into the top ranks of American life has had less to do with background and breeding and more to do with the ability to score well on tests and otherwise impress admissions bureaucracies at prestigious schools. The winners in this system, whether they become well-paid investment bankers, top professors, or senior government officials, believe that their prominence (and the rewards that go with it) are well deserved. Hayes has his doubts, and although some of his specific arguments are rooted in the language of the left, the critique of meritocracy is also a traditional staple of conservative thought. Given the poor records of elite individuals and elite institutions in recent years, the debate over meritocracy will likely become more intense."

She is not satisfied with the obvious answers: that the United States is far away and presents no territorial threat, that it promotes capitalist development and maritime security to the benefit of all, and that it acts as a counterweight to China. Her core answer to the puzzle is the overlap of local elite interests with American anticommunism during the Cold War, which gave rise to a consensus viewpoint that has reinforced itself over time. For Southeast Asian elites -- although not for labor movements or insurgent groups -- the U.S. presence has in fact been largely beneficent. Thus, the “interests” of her title seem to trump the “illusions.” As is often the case with constructivist analyses, such as this one, it is hard to distinguish the effect of perceptions from the effect of the actual material realities that actors perceive.

In this iconoclastic, detailed study, he takes on one of the most visible and widely supported theories in contemporary American politics: the idea that periodic realignments of voters produce stable political eras in which one party is the natural party of government (the “sun party”) and the other major party (the “moon party”) is only rarely able to prevail. Trende makes a strong argument that American politics is surprisingly fluid and that the widespread belief in the existence of distinct eras -- such as the New Deal era, from 1932 to 1968, or the era of Republican ascendance, from Richard Nixon through George W. Bush -- does not hold up under close examination. Trende also takes on the more recent claims that either the Democrats or the Republicans are headed for long-term political dominance. Instead, he argues, coalitions will continue to fray as new issues emerge and old ones fade, groups of voters shift their allegiances, and the parties adapt to changing electoral circumstances.

American religion is a complicated subject, and Douthat’s knowledge of Protestant denominational and theological details sometimes fails him. But his strong core argument is that Niebuhr was right: when American Christianity loses its grip on the idea of original sin, it rapidly falls victim to cultural fads and nationalist pride. Belief in the perfectibility of man leads to unreasoning optimism in the United States’ capacity to change both itself and the world; when these unrealistic hopes are not realized, Americans quickly turn to an equally unreasoning despair and fall prey to apocalyptic forebodings. Douthat sees this syndrome at work on both the left and the right today and argues that healthier political debate requires a reengagement with orthodox Protestant and Catholic ideas.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

Nagorski’s brisk and engaging account of American encounters with Nazi Germany is helpful in this regard. Nagorski follows various Americans and part Americans who lived or traveled in Germany between the two world wars. The picture is mixed: some Americans grasped the nature of Hitler and his movement early on; others defended it until quite late. Ideology played a part in determining those responses, as Americans saw Germany through their own preconceptions and political sensibilities. But it seems clear that the increasingly naked brutality of the Nazi regime, its oppression of German Jews, and its expansionist ambitions rapidly reduced the number of Americans ready to defend it. This is popular history, not a scholarly study, and much of Nagorski’s story will be familiar to those with some knowledge of the period. But it is good popular history and well worth a read.

He believes the American-led military intervention there was unwise and will lead to no lasting benefits, for it has been based on self-serving myths about counterinsurgency strategies and the quality of the Afghan state. The book includes some sharp accounts of the stresses the war has placed on American troops and features a depressing portrayal of Afghan President Hamid Karzai. But the heart of the book is the story of how Hastings managed to get access to General Stanley McChrystal, then the commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan, and members of his inner circle in order to write a profile for Rolling Stone. Their unguarded behavior and comments, which Hastings duly reported, ultimately cost McChrystal his job. The book addresses important issues about how reporters should relate to the military and the wars it fights, as well as less important ones about how Hastings organizes his life.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

The report also has a political subtext, which might reflect the intentions of some members of China’s incoming leadership, since the report was co-authored by staff from China’s cabinet-level Development Research Center and its Ministry of Finance. These themes include speeding the liberalization of the hukou (household registration) system, which denies rural residents social services if they move to the cities to find work; enhancing the weak social safety net; protecting land rights; allowing civil-society organizations to provide more social services; increasing intellectual, artistic, and academic freedom; and making officials observe the rule of law. The report also says that the Chinese government should reduce its intervention in markets and increase the economic role of private entrepreneurs, which presumably would give them more political clout as well. With respect to China’s international posture, the report conspicuously endorses the idea of China as a “stakeholder,” a concept first advanced in 2005 by then U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Robert Zoellick, who recently ended his tenure as president of the World Bank.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

First, it is a tale of screwups, false starts, and missed opportunities that is at the same time a story of smart (if not quite conclusive) intelligence work, meticulous (although by no means risk free) planning by an elite unit, and levelheaded decision-making by U.S. President Barack Obama. Second, it reveals a legendary terrorist leader boldly living and scheming just a mile away from Pakistan’s premier military academy but unable to even venture outside, let alone sustain a semblance of authority over his declining organization. Indeed, in his final days, bin Laden cut a rather pathetic figure, applying Just For Men hair dye to his beard and watching old videos of himself. Bergen captures both paradoxes superbly, drawing on his excellent government sources, his deep knowledge of al Qaeda, and his reporter’s instincts (which got him into the Abbottabad compound just after the raid). His book is full of fascinating details and illustrates the immense pressure on national security bureaucracies to provide options to policymakers and then reduce the risks associated with their implementation.

Bush. Cha explains, among other things, why the much-abused North Korean people seem to love the ruling Kim dynasty, why life in Pyongyang looks normal despite a long-running famine, why the West underplays human rights when negotiating with North Korea, and why Beijing supports Pyongyang despite tensions between the two governments. He defends the Bush administration’s tough talk and the short-lived agreements it reached with North Korea in 2005 and 2007. Cha claims that Pyongyang’s goal is not just American acknowledgment of its right to keep nuclear weapons and a U.S. guarantee not to attack but also an American pledge to protect the Kim dynasty’s rule. He concludes, however, with the prediction that the regime will fall within ten years.

When, Dudziak asks, does “wartime” begin and end? Even in the case of wars that seem to have clear beginnings and endings, such as the two world wars, it turns out that there is fuzziness at both ends. Indeed, Dudziak notes that to judge from the campaign medals awarded to members of the U.S. armed forces for service in military operations, there barely seems to have been any time in “postwar” American history that was not, in some sense, wartime. In democratic countries, war is assumed to be an exceptional condition that makes it acceptable for governments to suspend normal rights and liberties. But the “war on terror” suggested how that process could become interminable. This is a thoughtful and original take on the concept of war. But it is less convincing as an explanation for the application of exceptional measures. Successive British governments, for example, insisted that there was no war in Northern Ireland but nevertheless enacted far-reaching antiterrorist legislation.

It involves no original research but reflects decades of close analysis of Arab politics and economics. Beginning with Syria’s Hafez al-Assad, who came to power in 1970, the Arab world has produced not only presidents for life but also would-be dynasts. No other place, save North Korea and perhaps Central Asia, has exhibited this phenomenon. Owen points to some familiar factors to explain it: oil rents, conflict with Israel, intervention by outside powers, and brutal police states. Owen suggests that like Mafia dons, Arab presidents for life observed one another and learned from one another’s experiences and argues that the Arab League has provided a loose supportive framework for their ambitions. Although the shadows of monarchical presidents will be cast long into the future, Owen is confident that the uprisings have brought their era to an end.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

Logevall's book is magisterial. It focuses on the American response to the steady deterioration in France's position leading up to its calamitous defeat at the hands of the Vietminh at Dien Bien Phu in 1954 and the awkward compromises produced by the Geneva Conference later that year. Logevall ponders the dilemmas faced by U.S. President Dwight Eisenhower, who was reluctant to be seen as giving an inch to the Communists yet anxious to avoid committing ground troops to yet another East Asian conflict so soon after achieving a cease-fire in Korea. If there was to be any direct U.S. intervention on behalf of France, Eisenhower insisted that it have British support. But the United Kingdom, in the twilight of its own tenure as an Asian power, intended to steer clear of any Vietnamese (or Laotian) entanglements. The poor relationship between U.S. Secretary of State John Foster Dulles and his British counterpart, Anthony Eden, aggravated a basic disagreement between their two countries over how hard a line they ought to take, with the British more ready to make deals with the Communists. Logevall draws on a vast range of sources, cleverly analyzing the writer Graham Greene's journalism and his novel The Quiet American, and the controversies they generated, to illuminate the tension between British cynicism and American idealism."

His informed argument distinguishes between the religion of Islam and the totalitarian ideology of Islamism, which seeks to establish a global Islamic state governed by sharia. In this sense, jihadists and nonviolent Islamists share the same goal; only their means differ. “It is a great mistake to view Islamism as liberation theology characterized by an ‘attempt to repair,’” Tibi writes. “No, it is an agenda of cultural-totalitarian purification.” One cannot easily dismiss Tibi as an alarmist, but his argument does not allow for gray areas. Inveighing against those he sees as apologists, the naive, and the deceitful, Tibi hopes to engage his fellow Muslims in a revival of their classical, pluralistic heritage, because the effort to contain and reverse Islamism can come only from within. In the meantime, Tibi concludes, Islamism will remain “the most popular public choice in the world of Islam.”Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

He emphasizes the distinction between environmental objectives and policy instruments, arguing that evaluations of the instruments should be based on their actual contributions to objectives, and not on the good feelings that we may get from having simply done something. Along those lines, Sinn doubts that switching to biofuels will significantly help restrain climate change and suggests focusing instead on the “oil sheiks” and “coal barons” who in his judgment are producing far too much fossil fuel, partly because they fear the ultimate success of biofuels and the adoption of stronger environmental policies by rich countries. He proposes a worldwide limit on greenhouse gas emissions, enforced through a global cap-and-trade system and complemented by the levying of income taxes on the earnings that sheiks and barons make on their overseas financial investments, thus creating an incentive to leave more fossil fuels in the ground.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

It is an optimistic rendering, predicting the end of Arab presidents for life. He believes Islamists and jihadists were wrong-footed by the revolts, alluding to “the irrelevance of the Islamic factor” -- a conclusion that recent events call into question. Nevertheless, he rightly emphasizes the role of the youth bulge and high levels of unemployment in the Arab world, and he highlights the role of organized labor in launching the protests in Egypt and Tunisia. He concludes that the uprisings signaled a “tide” of an Arab democratic renaissance. Although he predicts temporary reversals, he does not see that tide ebbing in the near term. Unfortunately, Filiu makes almost no effort to situate his analysis in the broader literature on authoritarianism and democratic transitions. Thus, although he claims to reject the notion of Arab exceptionalism, he nevertheless treats the Arab world as somehow sui generis.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

All three have devoted significant public funding to biotechnology development and adjusted local laws and practices to support their bets. The chosen vehicles for their prospective success differ among the three: small and medium-sized local enterprises in Taiwan, large and diversified firms in South Korea, and multinational enterprises in Singapore. In all three, the responsibility for carrying out specific initiatives has been left more to individual firms than to government agencies, but all three governments have supported a few conspicuously high-performing companies. Nevertheless, the overall results have been disappointing so far. It is taking much more time and training to achieve successful commercial biotechnology development than it took to develop the electronics industries that thrived in all three places during an earlier era. Compared to developing electronics, developing biotechnology is proving to be a much more difficult task for these three economies, and their success in the field is far from assured.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

He adopts a broad perspective on the role of economics in wealthy modern societies. He questions the efficiency of contemporary financial markets, arguing that merely redistributive activities have come to outweigh creative ones, that the social contributions of finance are difficult to identify, and that many “hedging” innovations have become necessary simply to protect against instabilities created by the financial system itself -- hardly a net contribution to social welfare. On a more philosophical level, he addresses a persistent puzzle: although rich people tend to be happier than poor people, they do not seem to grow happier as they grow richer over time. Turner sees an answer in the role of social status. As people earn more, they tend to spend their new discretionary income on status symbols, such as luxury goods. But status is always relative and not necessarily obtainable through spending, and hence wealthier people feel a degree of frustration even as their incomes rise. Finally, Turner makes the case that growth should not be sought as an end in itself in rich countries. Rather, the focus should be on creating economic freedom and making possible a wide range of employment opportunities. Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

The decade of the 1990s was an exciting period in international finance, and Boughton captures that excitement well. The Warsaw Pact collapsed and the Soviet Union unraveled, and most of the new states that emerged abandoned central planning and engaged with the market-oriented world economy, with plenty of technical advice from the IMF. In 1994, Mexico suffered a major financial crisis, which threatened to spread to other developing countries in Latin America. In 1997, financial crises broke out in several hitherto exemplary Asian economies, followed by emergencies in Brazil and Russia in 1998. The IMF was heavily involved in all of those episodes, often breaking new ground in its own procedures and in the magnitude of its financial support to troubled economies. Boughton tells these stories skillfully, sometimes with revealing insights into the inner workings of the IMF.

The authors of this study examine various efforts to restrict both inflows and outflows and are left troubled by the potential effects of overly aggressive restrictions. They distinguish between good and bad controls on cross-border movements of capital, although they concede the distinction is not always clear. They also urge the negotiation of an international code of conduct -- analogous to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade enforced by the World Trade Organization -- that would establish rules (or at least guidelines) to prevent undesirable capital controls, particularly those that distort trade, and actively encourage desirable ones, particularly those that foster financial stability.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

Relying on extensive contacts with Brotherhood leaders, Brown explains how they saw advantages -- such as gaining the right to legal assembly and being allowed to propagate their views and deliver basic services to the needy -- to playing a game they were destined to lose. Whatever the merits of that strategy, even the relatively disciplined, ideologically consistent Brotherhood movements in Egypt and Tunisia did not precipitate the collapse of the semiauthoritarian regimes that had repressed them for decades. And even with the downfall of those regimes, Islamists in Egypt and Tunisia might not be able to mutate into more flexible political parties competing for votes. As the case of Turkey indicates, Islamist movements might have to wither before Islamist political parties can succeed.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

Susser knows the terrain as well as anyone. His informed, balanced analysis reveals just how little the terms of the conflict have changed over the decades. The “1948 file” (refugees and Jerusalem) is pitted against the “1967 file” (settlements and territory). The latter is tractable. But the former has proved intractable: the Palestinian insistence on the right of return scuppered the Camp David talks in 2000 and has motivated Israel’s demand that the Palestinians recognize the state’s “Jewishness.” Susser’s critical pulse races when he discusses proponents of a one-state solution and the Israeli settler movement: he shows no empathy for either. His answer to the impasse is to call for an Israeli withdrawal to the pre-1967 borders and to hope for the best in resolving the refugee issue in less fraught times.

However, those looking for a meticulous historical account of his career will be disappointed. His reflections are more lighthearted than profound, more anecdotal than analytic. And why not? In the ripeness of his years, Lewis is a happy man. He portrays himself as a historian self-consciously looking over his shoulder at the three facets of his persona -- Jewish, British, and Western -- and trying to correct for any bias they might produce. But he seems not to have noticed that as his profile as a public intellectual grew, his ability to correct sometimes faltered. Even now, Lewis extends no olive branch to his nemesis, the late Edward Said, dismissing Said’s argument that Orientalist European scholarship played a role in European imperial expansion as “just plain wrong” and as “an absurdity.” He rails against what he sees as the political correctness that followers of Said introduced to the study of the Middle East and Islam, describing his struggle against them as a “battle . . . between enforced ideology and freedom.” In so doing, he disregards the enforced correctness of what many regard as his side.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

Petersen fights that line of thought. He finds the conventional analysis inadequate and believes it leads to wrong-headed explanations of why the international community’s efforts to mitigate civil wars often fall short. Having spent years trying to understand the violence in the former Yugoslavia, he insists that those who have no interest in peace skillfully exploit fear, anger over lost status, and the desire for revenge generated by the bloodletting. International peacemakers, operating from conventional rational-choice calculations that rely on material incentives, do not understand the asymmetric disadvantage they are at when the rawness of emotions is used to thwart their efforts. Petersen not only presents rigorous, detailed case studies of the intervention in Kosovo and other Balkan interventions; he also demonstrates the similarities between them and other cases of interethnic conflict, such as in Rwanda and Northern Ireland.

Cliché-ridden thinking blights much popular commentary on the region and the putative competition under way there among China, Russia, and the United States. Cooley brings firsthand research and a detached, sensible eye to a complex, fast-moving subject. In brisk steps, he demonstrates that the “game” today is not the same one played by the great powers in the nineteenth century. Although competition exists among the major players, so does a considerable degree of cooperation. In today’s game, the Central Asian states are not helpless pawns but more than adept at writing and then exploiting the rules. That said, the way the greater powers pursue their agendas has an ugly side: increased corruption, human rights abuses, and political entropy. In addition to crafting a refined assessment of Chinese, Russian, and U.S. policies in the region and the Central Asian response to them, Cooley also speculates about what the dynamic in Central Asia indicates about how an emerging multipolarity might figure in other key regions of the world.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

And until the publication of this book, the phenomenon most central to the Western narrative of communism’s collapse -- dissident opposition -- had escaped this treatment. In an intelligent, fluent study of Czechoslovak dissent in the 1970s and 1980s, Bolton pushes aside the mythologized image of Czechoslovak dissidents and examines the diverse and sometimes conflicted ways they went about their lives. He is not so much deflating the political influence or courage of dissidents such as Václav Havel and Adam Michnik as he is “explaining the texture and psychology of dissident life,” breaking down the compartmentalized notions of dissidence and ordinary life and allowing them to flow together. In doing so, he affords a much broader understanding of what constituted a defection from regime orthodoxy, including the role of the underground music scene and the free thinkers and artists whose work predated the existence of a “dissident” label.

56,Bought and Sold: Living and Losing the Good Life in Socialist Yugoslavia,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2012-08-20/bought-and-sold-living-and-losing-good-life-socialist-yugoslavia,Bought and Sold: Living and Losing the Good Life in Socialist Yugoslavia,"“Consumer-oriented communist society” sounds like an oxymoron. But that phrase, Patterson argues, perfectly describes the Yugoslav system in the 1970s and 1980s. Once Marshal Tito broke with the Soviet Union in 1948 and launched Yugoslavia on a new path focused on worker self-management, a spirit of consumerism gradually began to take hold. The public, pushed by advertising agencies and encouraged by Communist Party bureaucrats, bought into consumption as a way of life. And eventually, consume they did -- on a level fundamentally similar to their capitalist neighbors and fundamentally unlike any of the other socialist countries. Patterson captures the scale and shape of the buying, the power of advertising, and the effect of Yugoslav guest workers returning from capitalist consumer societies. He also chronicles the misgivings about consumer culture felt in some parts of society and their efforts to tame and then fight the values that came with the goods. Nonetheless, consuming held the country together. When the economic crisis hit in the 1980s, the good life dissipated, and Patterson maintains that the loss of that source of legitimacy did as much to sunder the country as the rise of ethnonationalism.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."
57,The Last Dictatorship in Europe: Belarus Under Lukashenko,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2012-08-20/last-dictatorship-europe-belarus-under-lukashenko,The Last Dictatorship in Europe: Belarus Under Lukashenko,"To call Belarus “Europe’s last dictatorship” has become a cliché. The description is accurate but incomplete, and thus misleading. It suggests that the dictator Aleksandr Lukashenko’s regime represents a vestige of the past likely to go the way of its kindred anachronisms. In fact, Lukashenko’s authoritarian system constitutes a fresh incarnation of repression, with no end in sight. Bennett was the United Kingdom’s ambassador to Belarus from 2003 to 2007 and tells a firsthand tale of how Lukashenko methodically transformed a firm grip on power into an airless, brook-no-opposition tyranny. Bennett, like other authors before him, recognizes that as large as Lukashenko’s role is, Belarus’ history and the character of its elites abetted the country’s descent into dictatorship. His discouraging verdict is that short of an act of God or a fundamental change of heart on the part of Belarus’ allies in Russia, a physically vigorous Lukashenko is, as Belarus’ constitution now permits, there for life.

58,The Credibility of Transnational NGOs: When Virtue Is Not Enough,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2012-08-20/credibility-transnational-ngos-when-virtue-not-enough,The Credibility of Transnational NGOs: When Virtue Is Not Enough,"Nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) are increasingly integral to the governance of the global system: monitoring elections, investigating human rights abuses, providing humanitarian assistance, and certifying good business behavior. But who or what ensures that these transnational groups themselves act ethically? In one of the best studies yet of this conundrum, the editors of this volume concede that no global judicial bodies supervise the conduct of NGOs. Nonetheless, as the book demonstrates, NGOs are extremely sensitive to criticism and to the fact that their authority flows from a reputation for fairness and integrity. Chapters explore NGOs in areas such as child labor, elections, and human rights, identifying the ways these groups have strengthened their credibility by increasing their own transparency, professionalizing their staffs, and integrating themselves into the wider community of NGOs, which informally commits them to shared standards of conduct. And although NGOs are not regulated, this book makes clear that they are disciplined by the complex donor-client environment in which they operate.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

First is the impressive scale of the undertaking: it is the first volume in a planned trilogy dealing with the Cold War from beginning to end. Second, it treats theory as seriously as history. Finally, although Hopf’s historical research is extensive and original, he is not out to explain the Cold War’s sequence, dynamics, or turning points. Instead, he has plumbed Soviet political and cultural sources to reveal something more original: how the official reading of political realities during and immediately after Stalin’s rule, together with alternative readings that were subtly cultivated in cultural and academic institutions, accounted for the way in which the Soviet Union played its role in the early years of the Cold War. Hopf is a leading exponent of constructivist theory, and his trim, modified version of that approach brings a fresh perspective to why Stalin and his successors acted as they did in Eastern Europe and the developing world. However, as Hopf acknowledges, the theory contributes less to understanding the interplay with the United States and other major powers.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."
60,Rational Empires: Institutional Incentives and Imperial Expansion,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2012-08-20/rational-empires-institutional-incentives-and-imperial-expansion,Rational Empires: Institutional Incentives and Imperial Expansion,"What were the economic and geopolitical forces that led great powers to build empires and colonize distant peoples? And why did those empires later give way to movements for independence and self-determination? This provocative book by a young political scientist advances a rationalist theory of imperialism that sees all states as “revenue maximizers.” Blanken argues that closed, autocratic states are more likely to engage in territorial conquests than open, representative regimes, because they are less likely to see the virtues of free trade or uphold international rules and institutions. Spain’s imperial conquest of the New World is an example of a closed regime that sought overt political control of other territories. In contrast, the United States in the late nineteenth century had an open political system, which gave it fewer incentives to hold territory abroad. Blanken is careful to note that even open regimes, such as the nineteenth-century United Kingdom, can resort to territorial acquisition if constructing an informal empire is not possible and the lure of economic gain is sufficient. But missing from his account is a view of the subjugated and colonized peoples and their changing capacities for acquiescence and resistance.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

In the public imagination, such conflicts are deeply rooted in “ancient hatreds” or inevitable “clashes of civilizations.” In this engaging book, two veteran journalists challenge that popular narrative by examining places around the world where diverse peoples have found ways to live together peacefully: from the Indian state of Kerala, where Hindus, Muslims, and Christians have prospered together; to the Russian republic of Tatarstan, where the Muslim majority has lived peacefully with the Orthodox Christian minority; to the borough of Queens, in New York City, where a dizzying array of ethnic, religious, and language groups coexist. The book is a sort of travelogue, laced with local histories and colorful personalities. But it lacks a unifying argument about why some diverse places thrive and others erupt in violence. Capable political leadership appears to help, as does a shared sense of citizenship, complete with rights and protections. Alas, those insights are only faintly present in the book.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

They can try to balance against the powerful state, “bandwagon” with it, or pursue compromise strategies such as “soft balancing” or binding the leading state to regional and global institutions. The book offers a dozen interesting case histories of responses to global hegemons and regional powers, the best of which delve into the domestic politics of secondary states and the ways in which political elites and interest groups are strengthened or weakened by ties to hegemons and, in turn, how this shapes the national orientation. A chapter on the responses of Australia, Japan, and Taiwan to the rise of China shows the complexity and ambivalence of weaker states in the region. In the competition for hegemonic leadership in East Asia, it remains a fascinating question whether American security ties or Chinese trade ties will prove more alluring to those secondary states.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

Cutting taxes, limiting expenditures, and reducing debt have become the chief concerns of Republicans, whereas Democrats generally seek to preserve or even expand government spending and are willing to raise taxes to do so. The looming expiration of the George W. Bush tax cuts at the end of 2012 and the economy's weak recovery give these debates special urgency, as decisions made in the next few months are likely to shape the nation's economic, social, and political trajectory for years to come."

Taking a contrarian view, Rathbun argues that cooperation is better seen as a reflection of the beliefs people have about the trustworthiness of others. Borrowing findings from social psychology, Rathbun notes that people on the left tend to have a more benign view of human nature and see the world as less threatening than people on the right, and he hypothesizes that significant partisan differences exist on the issue of international cooperation. Rathbun applies his theory to the United States’ great moments of institutional order building: the League of Nations, the United Nations, and NATO. In these episodes, Rathbun argues, Democrats were more trusting than Republicans, leading them to be more supportive of multilateral security cooperation. But it is hardly surprising that partisan differences exist regarding such issues, and that insight itself is not very useful in explaining the dramatic sweep of security cooperation in the twentieth century unless it is tied to grander theories of power and order."

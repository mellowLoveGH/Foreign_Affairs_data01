0,We Need to Talk About Germany,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/germany/2019-08-15/we-need-talk-about-germany,We Need to Talk About Germany,"Robert Kagan’s thought-provoking essay (“The New German Question,” May/June 2019) addresses the important issue of how a collapse of the European Union and the liberal international order might affect Germany and its role within Europe. He concludes that such a breakdown would bring back the pre–World War II “German question,” which European integration and the Atlantic alliance were in part meant to resolve."
1,How Democratic Is Hungary?,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/hungary/2019-08-15/how-democratic-hungary,How Democratic Is Hungary?,"In his essay “Democracy Demotion” (July/August 2019), Larry Diamond laments the decline in prominence of U.S. democracy promotion. It is refreshing to have an American expert lift a mirror to the United States, writing that the country “has to repair its own broken democracy” before it can take up again the mantle of democracy promotion internationally. But Diamond betrays his biases when, expressing concern about “the wave of illiberal populism that has been sweeping developed and developing countries alike,” he claims that Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban “has presided over the first death of a democracy in an EU member state.”"
2,Autocracy Now,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/issue-packages/2019-08-13/autocracy-now,What’s Inside,"Historical eras tend to have characteristic leadership types: the fledgling democrats of the 1920s, the dictators of the 1930s and 1940s, the nationalist anticolonialists of the 1950s and 1960s, the gerontocrats of the 1970s, the fledgling democrats (again) of the 1980s and 1990s. Now we’re back to dictators."
3,Bad News,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/review-essay/2019-08-12/bad-news,Bad News,"In 2004—an ordinary, healthy year for the newspaper business—The Washington Post earned $143 million in profit. Five years later, in 2009, the paper lost $164 million amid a shift from paid print to free digital consumption, the erosion of its classified and local advertising businesses, and the global financial crisis. The collapse of its business model forced round after round of cutbacks, staff buyouts, and layoffs. That year, the Post shut all its domestic reporting bureaus outside the Washington area, including those in Chicago, Los Angeles, and New York."
4,The Population Bust,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/review-essay/2019-08-12/population-bust,The Population Bust,"For most of human history, the world’s population grew so slowly that for most people alive, it would have felt static. Between the year 1 and 1700, the human population went from about 200 million to about 600 million; by 1800, it had barely hit one billion. Then, the population exploded, first in the United Kingdom and the United States, next in much of the rest of Europe, and eventually in Asia. By the late 1920s, it had hit two billion. It reached three billion around 1960 and then four billion around 1975. It has nearly doubled since then. There are now some 7.6 billion people living on the planet."
5,Party Man,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/china/party-man,Party Man,"When Joe Biden met Xi Jinping in 2011, China’s leader in waiting hit the U.S. vice president with a volley of questions about U.S. politics. How did the system work? What was the relationship between the White House and Congress? How should Beijing interpret the political signals coming out of Washington? For Biden and his advisers, these were welcome questions after nearly a decade of frustration in dealing with Xi’s predecessor, the colorless, impenetrable Hu Jintao."
6,Can America Still Protect Its Allies?,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/world/2019-08-12/can-america-still-protect-its-allies,Can America Still Protect Its Allies?,"Since the end of World War II, U.S. strategic thinking has been dominated by the doctrine of deterrence. At its most simple, deterrence refers to one state’s ability to use threats to convince another that the costs of some action—say, invading one of its neighbors—will outweigh the benefits. Such was the logic behind the Cold War concept of mutual assured destruction: if either the United States or the Soviet Union used nuclear weapons, the other would respond with nuclear strikes of its own, resulting in the total devastation of both. By making the costs of war intolerably high, both sides hoped to keep the peace."
7,Winning the Peace in Iraq,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/iraq/winning-peace-iraq,Winning the Peace in Iraq,"For Americans who came of age near the turn of the current century, the war in Iraq was a generation-defining experience. When the United States invaded the country in 2003, toppling the government of Saddam Hussein in a matter of weeks, many saw the war as a necessary or even noble endeavor to stop the spread of weapons of mass destruction, which Saddam was allegedly developing—and bring democracy to parts of the world that had long suffered under the weight of tyranny."
8,The Dictators’ Last Stand,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/world/2019-08-12/dictators-last-stand,The Dictators’ Last Stand,"It has been a good decade for dictatorship. The global influence of the world’s most powerful authoritarian countries, China and Russia, has grown rapidly. For the first time since the late nineteenth century, the cumulative GDP of autocracies now equals or exceeds that of Western liberal democracies. Even ideologically, autocrats appear to be on the offensive: at the G-20 summit in June, for instance, President Vladimir Putin dropped his normal pretense that Russia is living up to liberal democratic standards, declaring instead that “modern liberalism” has become “obsolete.”"
9,Why America Loses Wars: Limited War and US Strategy From the Korean War to the Present,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2019-08-12/why-america-loses-wars-limited-war-and-us-strategy-korean-war,Why America Loses Wars: Limited War and US Strategy From the Korean War to the Present,"Since 1945, the United States’ experience of war has been a frustrating one, full of stalemates, setbacks, and only occasional victories. In this lively and opinionated book, Stoker pins a major part of the blame on muddled thinking about “limited war.” He is a scholar of Carl von Clausewitz and frequently turns to the Prussian general as his authority. Stoker believes that in wartime, leaders should first and foremost set proper political objectives (and reappraise them when necessary) and not let the means they are prepared to use dictate the ends. Time and again, from Korea to Vietnam to the war against the Islamic State (or ISIS), U.S. leaders have been either too vague about what they are seeking to do or unwilling to devote the requisite resources to achieve it. Theorists, such as Thomas Schelling, have contributed to the muddle by their readiness to talk about war as a form of bargaining. Stoker’s analysis of the United States’ failures is convincing, but his argument that better thinking would enable political leaders to set clear objectives and pursue them to victory is less so."
10,The War for Gaul: A New Translation,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2019-08-12/war-gaul-new-translation,The War for Gaul: A New Translation,"Julius Caesar’s war stories are so associated with Latin textbooks that they tend to get forgotten as contributions to military history. Originally dispatches sent back to the Senate in Rome, they explained how well Caesar was doing in his battles with a variety of rugged foes. They aimed to boost Caesar’s reputation as a great general and support his bid for power, but they also serve as useful records of events, if not quite the unvarnished truth. O’Donnell has produced a vigorous, modern, and uncluttered translation, removing sections added to the commentaries by later authors and adding few footnotes. He encourages readers to focus on the candor and cruelty with which Caesar describes his victories and his negotiations with foreign leaders. In a jaunty introduction, O’Donnell demonstrates how to appreciate the book as a major contribution to martial literature while deploring its morals. This is, he declares, “the best bad man’s book ever written.”"
11,Three Books on World War II,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2019-08-12/three-books-world-war-ii,Three Books on World War II,"Although a vast literature has covered every aspect of World War II, the war’s length, scope, and intensity mean that authors still manage to find new angles on the same material. Holland adopts a bottom-up approach to the familiar story of the June 1944 Normandy landings and the subsequent fighting on the continent. He shows how the commanders laid their plans and responded to new developments, and he conveys well the sheer scale of the logistical effort and the cleverness of the Allied deception plan. At the heart of the book are the stories of individual people caught up in great events: a teenage German soldier crouching in a bunker watching the Americans land while his confused superiors try to make sense of the invasion, Allied paratroopers dropping into hostile territory, resistance fighters sabotaging German communications, exhausted pilots flying sortie after sortie with little expectation that they would survive much longer, infantrymen scouring the roads and fields for ambushes, a nurse coping with the wounded. The sheer weight of the Allies’ firepower and their command of the air (the Allies flew 14,674 sorties on D-Day; the Luftwaffe flew 80) might make the result seem inevitable in retrospect, but amphibious landings had failed before, and Holland brings to life what a grueling, vicious, and terrifying battle this was."
12,Free Trade and Prosperity: How Openness Helps the Developing Countries Grow Richer and Combat Poverty,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2019-08-12/free-trade-and-prosperity-how-openness-helps-developing-countries,Free Trade and Prosperity: How Openness Helps the Developing Countries Grow Richer and Combat Poverty,"Panagariya puts forth a trenchant case against import tariffs and other forms of trade protectionism in developing countries. He carefully reviews both the economic theory of import substitution (government-led efforts to replace imported goods with domestically produced ones) and the empirical evidence from the past six decades showing which trade policies have fostered economic growth in developing countries. A vigorous supporter of free trade, he criticizes those who advocate import substitution as a path to development. He concedes that rapid economic growth often raises income inequality even as it almost always slashes poverty, but he cautions that some policies aimed at reducing inequality, including import substitution, may thwart growth and thus leave most people worse off."
13,Titans of the Climate: Explaining Policy Process in the United States and China,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2019-08-12/titans-climate-explaining-policy-process-united-states-and-china,Titans of the Climate: Explaining Policy Process in the United States and China,"This collaboration between an American scholar-official and a Chinese counterpart seeks to demystify how their respective governments make and execute policy and explores the two countries’ differing motivations, procedures, and constraints. The authors focus on environmental policy, especially the 2014 agreement between China and the United States, the two largest emitters of greenhouse gases, that set out a joint plan to mitigate climate change by 2030. The deal, which included China’s first-ever commitment to halt the growth of its emissions, made possible the Paris agreement on climate change the following year. U.S. President Donald Trump has pledged to withdraw the United States from the Paris agreement (a decision that will take effect in late 2020), but in the decentralized United States, the effect of the withdrawal will be muted, as over two-thirds of the states and many cities, probably with the support of a majority of U.S. citizens, will carry on with their climate change policies."
14,Evolution or Revolution: Rethinking Macroeconomic Policy After the Great Recession,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2019-08-12/evolution-or-revolution-rethinking-macroeconomic-policy-after,Evolution or Revolution: Rethinking Macroeconomic Policy After the Great Recession,"This thought-provoking and accessible collection of reflections by economists, central bankers, and government officials explores how the unusual circumstances that have characterized the global economy since 2007 should change economists’ understanding of macroeconomic policy. One obvious point is that economists should pay much more attention to the financial system and its influence on production and employment, as well as to the policies that might strengthen the system against external shocks and destabilizing internal dynamics. Many of the contributors also argue that over the past decade, economies in Europe and North America have relied too much on monetary policy to shore up weak growth and not enough on government taxing and spending to boost demand. They note that allowing capital to flow freely across borders, as it now does in many parts of the world, creates severe problems for emerging-market countries trying to manage their monetary policies and currency exchange rates. One disappointing omission is the lack of a discussion of the influence of accounting rules on corporate behavior and economic stability."
15,"Open: The Progressive Case for Free Trade, Immigration, and Global Capital",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2019-08-12/open-progressive-case-free-trade-immigration-and-global-capital,"Open: The Progressive Case for Free Trade, Immigration, and Global Capital","Amid a growing backlash against international economic interdependence, Clausing makes a strong case in favor of foreign trade in goods and services, the cross-border movement of capital, and immigration. This valuable book amounts to a primer on globalization, explaining without jargon both its benefits and its costs. The former, in her view, greatly outweigh the latter, but she also offers constructive proposals to reduce globalization’s downsides. Clausing’s field of expertise is tax avoidance and evasion by multinational corporations, which employ hordes of well-paid lawyers to take advantage of loopholes in national tax laws and swarms of lobbyists to help create and maintain those loopholes. Clausing argues that the tax reform passed by the U.S. Congress in 2017 contains many moves in the wrong direction."
16,Firefighting: The Financial Crisis and Its Lessons,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2019-08-12/firefighting-financial-crisis-and-its-lessons,Firefighting: The Financial Crisis and Its Lessons,"This collaboration by the three U.S. government officials who led the fight in the United States against the financial crisis of 2008 presents a mature and revealing assessment of the genesis and dynamics of the meltdown—and of the government’s ultimate success in halting it, although not before a painful recession had set in. One of the most interesting points is that they did not want Lehman Brothers to collapse in September 2008, despite some claims to the contrary, but lacked the legal authority to prevent it. The authors also argue that the many bailouts of other financial institutions worked, as they stopped a panic that could have been much worse. In the end, taxpayers recovered much more than they paid out, and executives and shareholders lost heavily, as they should have in a capitalist system—a point that undercuts fears that the bailouts would generate moral hazard and thus lead management and shareholders to take more risks in the future. Bernanke, Geithner, and Paulson believe that the U.S. economy is much better positioned to avoid a financial crisis today than it was in 2007 but that the federal government is now less well equipped to deal with one when it eventually occurs."
17,Nationalism: A Short History,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2019-08-12/nationalism-short-history,Nationalism: A Short History,"Greenfeld, the author of massive historical-sociological studies of the rise of nationalism, capitalism, and modernity, here distills the story of nationalism into a short and captivating historical drama. She traces the origins of “national consciousness” to sixteenth-century England, when the new Tudor monarchy was attempting to rebuild—and legitimate—the political order following the destruction of the aristocracy in the dynastic wars of the previous century. The old self-understanding of England as a social hierarchy was replaced with an image of “the nation,” made up of a single English people. Greenfeld argues that the notions of social equality—secular, democratic, and egalitarian—that dominated this English-led “revolution in consciousness” played out across the rest of the world in the following centuries. The Protestant Reformation, the American and French Revolutions, the rise of commercial capitalism, the coming of modern science, the emergence of modern Chinese and Japanese nationalism—all have their place in Greenfeld’s grand narrative. Greenfeld argues that nationalism’s appeal flows from the dignity that a vibrant national consciousness bestows on a nation’s members. The task for those seeking to preserve the liberal democratic way of life is to reclaim nationalism’s progressive orientation."
18,Leadership and the Rise of Great Powers,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2019-08-12/leadership-and-rise-great-powers,Leadership and the Rise of Great Powers,"Yan takes on a classic question: Why do great powers rise and fall? With an eye to explaining recent Chinese success in challenging U.S. dominance, he advances a theory he calls “moral realism.” Borrowing from ancient Chinese philosophers, Yan argues that when governments define a moral worldview, they are more likely to successfully take over from their declining peers. Much of the book details how states can project moral strength in world affairs, which, for Yan, means offering sober and consistent definitions of the national interest, protecting international norms, and establishing credibility in alliances. Yan argues that since the end of the Cold War, China has been more successful—or “efficient”—in this project than the United States and thus has steadily gained ground on its rival, although he admits that China has yet to develop a set of postliberal values that can compete for global influence. It’s not entirely clear whether Yan’s theory is distinctively Chinese, but he is surely correct that U.S.-Chinese competition will turn not just on hard power but also on each country’s ability to command the moral high ground."
19,The World’s Most Prestigious Prize: The Inside Story of the Nobel Peace Prize,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2019-08-12/worlds-most-prestigious-prize-inside-story-nobel-peace-prize,The World’s Most Prestigious Prize: The Inside Story of the Nobel Peace Prize,"Since it was first awarded, in 1901, the Nobel Peace Prize has been given annually to a kaleidoscopic assortment of activists, politicians, diplomats, moral leaders, and organizations—from Theodore Roosevelt and Jane Addams to Amnesty International and the European Union. Lundestad, a longtime director of the Norwegian Nobel Institute, argues that despite the diversity of figures and causes, the honorees tend to reflect a “Norwegian approach” to international politics, a mix of realism, idealism, and liberal internationalism that emphasizes practical efforts to promote democracy, human rights, humanitarianism, disarmament, and international cooperation. In its early years, the prize went primarily to European and American men, but the committee has since broadened its reach, honoring women, non-Western groups, and activists engaged in local and nontraditional peacemaking, such as environmentalism and campaigns against sexual violence. Many view the Nobel Peace Prize as an expression of Western liberal values. The Chinese government protested bitterly in 2010 when the award was given to Liu Xiaobo, a Chinese human rights activist. But Lundestad makes an eloquent case that the prize has a universal appeal, grounded in humanitarian and nonviolent ideals on which no country or civilization holds a monopoly."
20,Democratic Capitalism at the Crossroads: Technological Change and the Future of Politics,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2019-08-12/democratic-capitalism-crossroads-technological-change-and-future,Democratic Capitalism at the Crossroads: Technological Change and the Future of Politics,"Beginning in the 1980s, Boix argues, revolutions in communications and the globalization of trade and production undermined the old class compromises at the heart of Western liberal democracy. Highly educated professionals have seen their incomes soar, and previously well-paid manufacturing workers, the old backbone of the middle class, are now struggling to survive. Boix places this crisis in perspective, illuminating the fraught relationship among technology, capitalism, and democracy over the last two centuries. The book focuses on watershed moments, starting with the birth of the Industrial Revolution in cities such as Manchester, where low factory wages, poor living conditions for workers, and rising wealth for owners brought political struggles over state protection and the extent of democracy. The golden age of capitalism and democracy emerged in the early twentieth century in places such as Detroit, where new technologies of mass production raised labor productivity, boosted wages, brought down inequality, and enabled vibrant liberal democracies. Today, another technological revolution is generating radical income inequality and destabilizing political life. Yet Boix rejects technological and economic determinism. Industrial societies, he believes, can still regain control of the future."
21,The Oxford Handbook of the Ethiopian Economy,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2019-08-12/oxford-handbook-ethiopian-economy,The Oxford Handbook of the Ethiopian Economy,"Over the last two decades, Ethiopia has emerged as one of the fastest-growing economies in the world. This has proved a boon for analysts, many of whom have seized on Ethiopia’s success as vindication of their particular philosophy of economic development. The editors of this massive volume on the Ethiopian economy have commendably sought to include as many viewpoints as possible while emphasizing empirical approaches. The book covers the major issues, including macroeconomic policy, the development of the social welfare system, agriculture, and industrial policy. Although the different theoretical explanations for Ethiopia’s successes and failures rarely confront one another in the book, the volume as a whole reveals a pragmatic and flexible government trying to solve developmental problems with the resources it has available. Ethiopia has made mistakes, but unlike many other African countries, it has generally avoided repeating them and has tended to eschew ideology in favor of what works on the ground. The state has taken an interventionist stance, but it usually pays attention to market signals and the welfare of its population."
22,Combatants: A Memoir of the Bush War and the Press in Uganda,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2019-08-12/combatants-memoir-bush-war-and-press-uganda,Combatants: A Memoir of the Bush War and the Press in Uganda,"In 1984, Pike, then a London-based journalist fresh out of college, used expatriate Ugandan connections to arrange access to the camps of the National Resistance Army in the central Ugandan bush, where the group was fighting a guerrilla war against the regime of Milton Obote, under the leadership of a 40-year-old Yoweri Museveni. Pike’s reports in the British press, which documented atrocities perpetrated by the Ugandan government and cast the NRA in a favorable light, helped the group gain credibility in the West. In 1986, when Museveni came to power, he invited Pike to edit the government newspaper, the New Vision, promising him editorial independence. For two decades, Pike ran the paper, turning it into Uganda’s newspaper of record, before the regime’s growing authoritarianism forced him out. Pike tells the story well, mixing his personal experiences with an analysis of the last 30 years of Ugandan history. He follows his detailed account of the nasty civil war of the 1980s with a perceptive look at the Museveni regime, from its early informal idealism to the ossified personal dictatorship of today."
23,African Catholic: Decolonization and the Transformation of the Church,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2019-08-12/african-catholic-decolonization-and-transformation-church,African Catholic: Decolonization and the Transformation of the Church,"The Catholic Church is often described as one of the key instruments of French colonialism, working in cahoots with the administrators of France’s colonies in central and western Africa to legitimate French rule to its parishioners. That may have been true in the early years of the French empire, but Foster tells the much more complex and interesting story of the decolonization era, when the church slowly but surely came to grips with the inevitability of independence and the need to Africanize itself. Foster emphasizes the influence of African Catholic intellectuals, such as the Senegalese Alioune Diop, who argued that the church needed to become more universalistic and less European. The Vatican’s changing attitudes were partly the result of sheer pragmatism; after African states’ independence, retaining an all-French roster of bishops and cardinals on the continent would have been a nonstarter. But Foster argues that the church of the post–World War II era was independently undergoing major doctrinal changes, affected at least in part by the end of colonialism. Her research uncovers conclusive evidence, for example, of Diop’s influence on Pope John XXIII in the lead-up to the Second Vatican Council."

In this tightly argued book, which focuses on Cameroon, Kenya, and Tanzania but has implications for all authoritarian countries that nevertheless regularly hold elections, Morse argues that such regimes generally rely on organizational strength and legitimacy to win at the ballot box—but when they lack those attributes, they turn to violence, repression, and vote rigging to stay in power. Morse’s work helps explain the resilience of regimes such as those in Mozambique and Tanzania, where well-organized and relatively legitimate dominant political parties have maintained control over systems that are far from fully democratic, while only rarely relying on repression or fraudulent elections. Interestingly, Morse also shows that international pressure matters. When foreign governments and international organizations are willing to condone nondemocratic practices and continue their economic support, authoritarian regimes prove more stable."

Nonetheless, it develops some keen insights into the effects of the Internet in Kenya. With more than seven million of its citizens on Facebook and over a million on Twitter, Kenya may well be sub-Saharan Africa’s most online country. Nyabola describes a sophisticated community of users who have found agency through the Internet, whether in criticizing CNN for what they see as its Eurocentric coverage or in publicizing corruption and incompetence by Kenyan officials. The Kenyan government, Nyabola reveals, is deeply ambivalent about the Internet, attracted to it as a symbol of modernity but wary of the hard-to-control political spaces it creates. Nyabola’s conclusions are far from optimistic. She documents how the Internet allowed foreign actors, such as the British political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica, to manipulate voters during the 2017 Kenyan elections and explores how social media may come to undermine Kenyan democracy."
26,The PM Years,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2019-08-12/pm-years,The PM Years,"In this hefty second volume of his autobiography, the two-time Australian prime minister settles scores with Julia Gillard, a fellow Labor Party politician who in 2010 ousted him in what Rudd calls a “cynical coup.” Their struggle propelled Australia toward the kind of poisonous politics that is afflicting so many democracies today. Besides Gillard and “the faceless men of the [Labor Party] factions,” Rudd blames his ouster on the Rupert Murdoch–owned media, which opposed his progressive policies, and on mining interests who he believes colluded with Gillard and her allies to prevent the imposition of a new tax. The book also details Rudd’s many accomplishments on issues such as Australia’s response to the 2008 financial crisis, climate change, indigenous affairs, infrastructure, same-sex relationships, and health care. Unusually for a political memoir, the book is unguardedly emotional. This, together with Rudd’s elephantine memory, brings the reader as close to the daily texture of life in politics as it is possible for an outsider to get."
27,In Plain Sight: Impunity and Human Rights in Thailand,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2019-08-12/plain-sight-impunity-and-human-rights-thailand,In Plain Sight: Impunity and Human Rights in Thailand,"This deeply researched history focuses not so much on the human rights violations that have occurred in Thailand during its frequent episodes of military rule but on the mechanisms by which the perpetrators have avoided accountability. These have included legalizing the arbitrary detention of purported “enemies of the nation,” “hooligans,” and persons considered a “danger to society”; author­izing summary executions when necessary to “defend the nation”; giving the police the discretion to do anything they want in the name of eliminating communism; holding blameless any person acting in the line of duty; dismissing cases as falling outside the jurisdiction of the courts or for insufficient evidence; and declaring amnesties. The legal techniques have varied, but their purpose has stayed the same: to protect the monarchistic elite and its agents. Haberkorn argues that repression is all the more effective when the authorities openly twist the law to protect the perpetrators. The more blatant the impunity, the stronger the message that victims have no hope of redress."
28,The Great Successor: The Divinely Perfect Destiny of Brilliant Comrade Kim Jong Un,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2019-08-12/great-successor-divinely-perfect-destiny-brilliant-comrade-kim,The Great Successor: The Divinely Perfect Destiny of Brilliant Comrade Kim Jong Un,"As the younger son of his father’s third wife, Kim Jong Un was an unlikely heir to the North Korean throne, but from the regime’s perspective, he turned out to be a brilliant choice. He has taken over his grandfather and father’s dynastic cult of personality; reportedly killed, imprisoned, or brought to heel the senior advisers he inherited; maintained the system of hereditary political castes and the gulag; tightened the country’s borders; heightened surveillance of ordinary citizens; restored some economic dynamism; fostered a small moneyed class of supporters; pushed forward missile and nuclear weapons testing; evaded global sanctions; resisted Chinese pressure; and run rings around two U.S. presidents. To figure out how Kim has done it all, Fifield tracked down his aunt and uncle, who run a dry cleaning shop in the United States; interviewed his schoolmates from Switzerland; spoke with the business partner of Kim’s assassinated half brother, Kim Jong Nam; and visited North Korea 11 times. The North Korean system, Fifield concludes, is strong enough to last for a long time. The biggest questions concern the state of the economy and Kim’s health. If he survives to hand power to a fourth generation, the man Fifield labels “the most Machiavellian figure of our time” will have achieved a remarkable feat."
29,The Costliest Pearl: China’s Struggle for India’s Ocean,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2019-08-12/costliest-pearl-chinas-struggle-indias-ocean,The Costliest Pearl: China’s Struggle for India’s Ocean,"The Indian Ocean is scattered with islands, some small, some large, some inhabited, some not, but all strategically significant and all more or less militarized. They range from the Comoros and Madagascar, near the African coast, to the Maldives and Diego Garcia, south of India, to the Andaman and Nicobar Islands and the Cocos Islands, off the coasts of Myanmar and Indonesia, respectively. Lintner recounts centuries of competition among pirates, fishermen, slave traders, mercenaries, money launderers, colonists, and the occasional North Korean adviser to an island dictator. In recent times, the Indian and U.S. navies have dominated the ocean. But under its Belt and Road Initiative, Beijing has been building ports at a rate that suggests China may have ambitions to join them as a major Indian Ocean power. Lintner’s decades of reporting from all over Asia lend him shrewd insight into the region’s geography and politics. The book does not substantiate his claim that the risk of war is greater in the Indian Ocean than in the South China Sea, but it shatters any complacency the Indian navy and its partners might have about their ability to dominate these waters without challenge."

It’s not even past.” Neither the Uighur population nor the Chinese authorities have forgotten the short-lived Islamic Republic of East Turkestan of 1933 to 1934 or the longer and more institutionalized East Turkestan Republic of 1944 to 1946. Both grew out of the Uighur enlightenment movement, whose leading thinkers believed that Han rulers had treated the Uighurs unfairly ever since their region was incorporated into China in the late nineteenth century. Wang uses original documents in many languages to bring the current crisis into historical focus. The two Uighur independence movements were led by pro-Soviet Uighur intellectuals who had received modern educations. Although they were ethnic nationalists, they used elements of Islam to forge a fragile common identity with other classes and ethnic groups, including the more numerous, nomadic Kazakhs. The two short-lived episodes of self-rule showed what the government of an independent East Turkestan might look like and that such a country would not survive without Russian support, which in both historical cases proved neither strong nor lasting."

He diagnoses the Indian prime minister as an authoritarian who is nevertheless averse to the kind of bold change needed to move India beyond its current status of “great power lite.” To realize India’s proper role, Karnad thinks, the country must drop its misguided obsession with Pakistan and focus on China; it should, however, avoid aligning with an overweening and unreliable United States and forge links with other powers, such as Australia, Japan, and the countries of Southeast Asia. India should develop the ability to produce advanced weapons systems domestically, strengthen its influence in Bhutan and Nepal, build military bases on Indian Ocean islands, and adopt a nuclear first-use policy to deter Chinese aggression. New Delhi should even play “the Tibet and Uyghur cards,” a disruptive proposal that Karnad does not spell out in detail. India’s entrenched and uncoordinated security bureaucracy is unlikely to adopt these ideas. But Karnad makes a bracing case that if it does not, India will continue to play a “small stakes game anchored in short policy horizons.”"
32,A Thousand Small Sanities: The Moral Adventure of Liberalism,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2019-08-12/thousand-small-sanities-moral-adventure-liberalism,A Thousand Small Sanities: The Moral Adventure of Liberalism,"In this spirited manifesto, Gopnik paints a sweeping portrait of modern liberalism’s founding principles and accomplishments and makes the case for the theory’s continued relevance in today’s struggle to build decent and inclusive societies. Gopnik traces liberalism’s origins to the Enlightenment and the early modern humanistic tradition. It was rooted in a belief—articulated by thinkers such as David Hume and Adam Smith—in the inherent sociability of people and the human capacity for mutual respect. Liberal society is grounded not in blood and soil, nor in traditional authority, but rather in an idea of “shared choice,” a vision of a political community held together by crosscutting values: liberty, equality, and toleration. For Gopnik, liberalism is best understood not as a formal doctrine, a set of abstract principles, or a group of fixed political institutions, but as a way of life. Across the centuries, liberal thought has been united by “the liberal temperament,” an embrace of pluralism and reform and a skepticism of utopias. Liberalism’s great project, as Gopnik eloquently argues, is the unending struggle to build a society with both liberty and equality at its core."
33,Super Continent: The Logic of Eurasian Integration,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2019-08-12/super-continent-logic-eurasian-integration,Super Continent: The Logic of Eurasian Integration,"This book is the definitive statement of Calder’s long-standing thesis that technological and economic changes are integrating the Eurasian “super continent,” as foreseen over a century ago by the British strategist Halford Mackinder. Beneath the churn of political events, this integration is driven not only by the familiar dynamics of globalization but also by such less noted factors as the growing efficiency of transport logistics and the digitization of customs procedures. U.S. pressure on China and Russia is pushing the two countries together, and complementary economic strengths are drawing Germany closer to China. China is promoting integration through its Belt and Road Initiative, seeking to aid its giant state-owned enterprises, which are desperate to reach beyond their saturated home market. Integration could be slowed by an economic crisis or an ethnoreligious conflict in China or by ambivalence in other countries about Chinese influence, but it would take a cataclysm to stop it. Calder thinks that China will seek not U.S.-style hegemony but a new kind of influence in which the benefits of integration are more widely distributed among countries, which he labels “distributive globalism.” If so, he recommends that the United States cooperate with countries such as India and Japan, and even to some extent with China, to promote pluralism within the zone of Chinese influence."

In 2015, she produced an insightful book, The Unraveling, chronicling her service. In this new book, she shifts from participant to spectator. The results are disappointing. Starting in 2011 with the early Arab Spring, Sky recounts her travels across several regions, from Galicia in Spain to the mountains of Kyrgyzstan, often guided by diplomats and other acquaintances from her time in Iraq. Sky admits that finding direction and purpose after she left Iraq was not easy and says that her excursions across the Middle East gave her new shots of adrenaline.

His account ends several months before ISIS lost the last of its territory with the fall of Baghouz, in Syria, in March of this year, but Clarke’s main message is that the jihadists will regroup in Iraq and Syria and that al Qaeda and ISIS will lead the way. What is more controversial, he argues that the launching of a caliphate by ISIS, in 2014, will in the end prove far more significant than its destruction. He does not add much to the existing literature on jihadism, and although he offers some intriguing figures, he does not explain them. There are some 230,000 jihadists worldwide, he says, but only 19,000 people on government terrorist watch lists. ISIS recruited around 43,000 fighters from 120 countries; between 6,000 and 11,000 of them may be left. In all, Clarke estimates that some 70,000 jihadists have been killed in recent years."

She examines the country’s descent into chaos, from the golden period of the 1980s, when oil rents and out-migration were high, through the growing kleptocracy under President Ali Abdullah Saleh in the 1990s and early years of this century, to the civil war that began in 2015 and the resulting humanitarian catastrophe. Along the way, she analyzes Yemen’s tribes, its varieties of Islam, its economy, and the mismanagement of its water resources. She dismisses the claim that Iran is supporting the Houthis in the civil war, but she fails to provide sufficient evidence to support her skepticism. She also blames neoliberal policies promoted by the International Monetary Fund for Yemen’s growing inequality. Her account ends before the assassination of Saleh at the hands of the Houthis in 2017. Since then, no one of his Machiavellian caliber has emerged to replace him. Four years of a Saudi-led, U.S.-backed assault by pro-government forces have devastated Yemen’s infrastructure and people, but Lackner is clear that the Houthis do not offer an attractive alternative government and doubts that the current UN-led negotiations can bring a sustainable peace."
37,Two Books on Genocide,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2019-08-12/two-books-genocide,Two Books on Genocide,"These two books are gut-wrenching chronicles of human depravity that show how ordinary people can become barbarians. Both describe, in numbing detail, decades of pillage, rape, starvation, and torture. Morris and Ze’evi tie together the three waves of killing that swept across the Christian population of Anatolia (in modern-day Turkey) from 1894 to 1924. First, the Ottoman Empire, under Sultan Abdulhamid II, massacred hundreds of thousands of Armenians. Then, in 1914, the Young Turks, who had marginalized the sultan after the revolution of 1908, launched their own, far larger Armenian genocide. Finally, after 1919, the Republicans under Kemal Ataturk began killing and deporting the remaining Christians, many of whom were Greek. Over the three decades, between 1.5 million and 2.5 million Armenians, Assyrians, and Greeks were murdered. Morris and Ze’evi convey well the horror of the killings. In a cave where the bodies of at least 100 Greeks were found, they write that “all apparently had first had their hands and feet cut off, after that they were either burnt alive in the cave or had their throats cut.”"
38,Putin’s Counterrevolution,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2019-08-12/putins-counterrevolution,Putin’s Counterrevolution,"Democratic institutions, even weak ones, do not wither and die overnight. Leaders bent on undermining free elections or co-opting the judiciary often require years of methodical plotting and legislative chicanery to achieve their goals. And such changes often unfold far from the eye of the general public. In this comprehensive historical study, Aleksashenko does a great service by documenting the decades-long institutional erosion and consolidation of authoritarian rule in Putin-era Russia. The author hits his stride in his discussion of the state’s intervention in the economy. Many previous works have described the consequences of the Kremlin’s takeover of the lucrative oil industry. But the state’s hand has extended into many other sectors, as well. Through detailed interviews and careful work with primary sources, Aleksashenko shows how the Putin regime has taken on oligarchs, pressured international investors, built gigantic state-owned enterprises, and bailed out failing firms. The book offers a definitive account of how, since the late 1990s, the balance of power in Russia has shifted decisively in favor of government officials over private firms. The regime’s economic dominance helps explain its lack of interest in reforms that would protect the property rights or political freedoms of potential challengers."

He details how a formerly persecuted church made itself indispensable to Russia’s nuclear forces by providing them with ideological legitimation as they faced a catastrophic loss of funding and social prestige in the early 1990s. Three decades later, the church has become a prominent presence throughout the entire military, but the nuclear branch stands out as the most imbued with clericalism. Priests regularly minister to its service members, joining their flock on operational missions. The church has built houses of worship on all of Russia’s nuclear bases, Orthodox icons grace nuclear weapons platforms, and commanders have increasingly incorporated religious ideas into their strategic thinking. Adamsky convincingly shows that this began as a grass-roots process, whereby those of lower military rank recognized priests as a source of the kind of pastoral and psychological support they sorely needed in a high-stress work environment. Only later did the regime take notice and seek to systematize the phenomenon from above. The result is an unprecedented nuclear-religious culture, whose emergence has significant strategic implications, including the introduction of theological concepts into Russian military planning."

For the countries of eastern Europe, joining the EU was just the beginning. What followed was a process of remaking people and institutions in the name of political liberalism. Dzenovska studied this painstaking effort in Latvia, which joined the EU in 2004. Her book is an anthropological analysis of government programs designed to promote tolerance and to help the “not-yet-European” Latvians break free of the toxic effects of two dogmatic systems of thought: Soviet communism and nationalism. She tells fascinating stories of her encounters with “tolerance workers” and their “students,” as well as government officials, border guards and asylum seekers, and reveals how the reeducation effort overlooked the essential contradiction of promoting inclusion in a country that had recently liberated itself from the Soviet Union and embarked on an ethnonationalist nation-building project. Limits to inclusion are central to Dzenovska’s analysis of contemporary Europeans polities that are built on values of openness yet are forced to keep their borders securely guarded. Dzenovska’s critique is worth bearing in mind as increased migration has led to a rise in right-wing nativism in Europe and the United States, further undermining Western liberalism’s claim to moral and political superiority."

It traces the history of the Russian steam bath all the way back to the Middle Ages, exploring how its image and function have shifted over time. Peter the Great, the westernizing reformer who led Russia in the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries, saw the banya as an outmoded habit of the common people. Westernized Russian elites of that era readily agreed with Europeans who ridiculed the bathhouse as barbarous. But after Russia defeated Napoleon in the early nineteenth century, the banya became a patriotic symbol: a cartoon published at the time showed the terrified French emperor in a banya being thrashed by Russian soldiers. In the early twentieth century, amid the louche atmosphere of late imperial Russia, urban bathhouses came to be associated with sex and sin. When the Bolsheviks took over after the Russian Revolution, they sought to recast the banya as a source of modernizing cleanliness: Stalin declared that Soviet communism would not countenance dirty people. As the Soviet era drew to a close, the recreational function of the bathhouse superseded its utilitarian one. In the words of an American reporter writing in the 1970s, the banya was “the closest thing Russian males [had] to a men’s club.” More recently, a highly popular film depicted the banya as a place for tough men who can stand up for Russia against the corrupt and decadent West."

One of them, he contends, is the belief that today’s tensions between Russia and the United States stem from Russian President Vladimir Putin’s long-standing antagonism toward the West. Wood argues that, in fact, the dramatic deterioration of relations witnessed in recent years was all but inevitable and is rooted in the massive power and resource imbalance between the two sides that was produced by the collapse of the Soviet Union. Wood also refutes the idea that today’s standoff is a new Cold War: it lacks any clear ideological dimension, he points out, and, unlike the Cold War, leaves many countries and regions untouched by the tensions between Russia and the West. Wood criticizes some Russian liberals who oppose Putin for their misplaced faith in an “idealized” capitalism based on “undistorted” free-market principles. There is no capitalism outside of history, Wood reminds readers, and the kind of capitalism found in Russia today is directly descended from the postcommunist order installed by Putin’s predecessor, Boris Yeltsin. Putin has just consolidated and prolonged Yeltsin’s regime. Hence Wood’s central message: don’t focus too much on Putin—the system over which he presides is more important, and it can outlast him."

She hardly qualifies as an apologist for Russian President Vladimir Putin, but she gives him ample credit for achieving his main foreign policy goals: reasserting Russia’s position as a global player, protecting the country’s sovereignty, gaining respect from non-Western actors, and overcoming the West’s attempts to isolate Russia. To Stent, a historical outlook is indispensable for understanding Putin’s foreign policy. For centuries, she explains, the country’s vast territory and lack of natural borders have bred a deep-seated sense of vulnerability. Putin saw the West as taking advantage of the weakness caused by the Soviet collapse, and he responded by craftily exploiting his Western rivals’ missteps and lack of unity. Eventually, these tactics aided Russia’s resurgence on the global stage. He has been particularly successful, Stent notes, in handling relations with China and the countries of the Middle East. Stent devotes far less space to Putin’s policy failures: the high cost of his clashes with the West, Russia’s lack of any real allies, and the country’s persistent economic weakness. In some respects, Putin’s Russia looks a bit like the Soviet Union did in the late 1970s and early 1980s, under Leonid Brezhnev: domestic stagnation combined with activism abroad. Stent does not claim to know exactly which policies Western countries should pursue in dealing with Putin, but she counsels strategic patience and preparedness—and suggests that it would be wise to expect the unexpected."

But Pérez observes that there is a good reason for the shared red, white, and blue: the Cuban flag was designed in Manhattan. In the nineteenth century, New York hosted a thriving transnational community of Cubans, the flag-designing revolutionary general Narciso López among them. In those years, prosperous Cuban investors manufactured, financed, and traded sugar and cigars in Cuban and U.S., as well as global, markets. Cuban émigrés also organized to liberate their homeland from despotic Spain, some lobbying for U.S. annexation and others battling for full independence. The Cuban founding father José Martí lived in New York for much of his adult life. Writing for several Latin American newspapers, Martí mixed admiration for American industriousness and liberty with criticism of the United States’ social shortcomings and forebodings about U.S. imperial pretentions. Pérez vividly describes how the tightly knit Cuban émigré community reproduced the political cleavages and social mores of its homeland. Although some émigrés absorbed New York’s urbane democratic modernity, the intransigence and intolerance inspired by Spanish rule endured in Cuban political culture, abroad and at home."

After excoriating free trade while campaigning for the U.S. presidency, he has made economic nationalism a centerpiece of his agenda in office. His administration has pulled out of some trade deals, including the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), and renegotiated others, including the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement. Many of Trump’s actions, such as the tariffs he has imposed on steel and aluminum, amount to overt protectionism and have hurt the U.S. economy. Others have had less obvious, but no less damaging, effects. By flouting international trade rules, the administration has diminished the country’s standing in the world and led other governments to consider using the same tools to limit trade arbitrarily. It has taken deliberate steps to weaken the World Trade Organization (WTO)—some of which will permanently damage the multilateral trading system. And in its boldest move, it is trying to use trade policy to decouple the U.S. and Chinese economies."

Mann: President Johnson, the Cold War, and the Restructuring of Latin American Foreign Policy","Allcock works hard to rehabilitate the reputation of Thomas Mann, U.S. President Lyndon Johnson’s senior adviser on Latin America. Loyalists of Johnson’s predecessor, John F. Kennedy, along with other liberal critics, blamed Mann for abandoning the idealism of the Alliance for Progress, Kennedy’s ambitious economic and security assistance programs for Latin America, in favor of supporting military dictatorships and conservative business interests. Allcock persuasively argues that, in fact, Kennedy’s contradictory Cold War security strategies always preferred pro-U.S. authoritarians over potentially pro-Soviet leftists. Moreover, the administration was already shifting away from its lofty early rhetoric and unrealistic goals by the time of Kennedy’s assassination. Nor was Mann an economic reactionary, as his detractors have claimed; rather, he adhered to New Deal beliefs in government spending on infrastructure projects and public intervention to mitigate market failures. Mann supported international agreements to stabilize the price of coffee, for example, and was unafraid to criticize corporate executives he considered socially irresponsible. A fluent Spanish speaker with years of diplomatic experience, Mann also deserves credit for reducing tensions with Mexico and Panama by negotiating bilateral treaties."

Harsh U.S. policies have, however, killed an unknown number of immigrants, as people resort to more dangerous routes and some die in overcrowded detention facilities. The only winners are the federal bureaucracies whose budgets and personnel swell, opportunistic politicians who traffic in fear-mongering, and the defense contractors that supply the facilities and weaponry. Although the Trump administration may have a­dopted “zero tolerance” policies, since the 1980s, the U.S. Congress and various administrations, including those of Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, have laid the groundwork for the mistreatment of immigrants through legislation, executive orders, and anti-immigrant rhetoric. Housed within the military-minded Department of Homeland Security, the 20,000-strong Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, in Frey’s view, has morphed into an unaccountable, ill-trained “clandestine police force” running the world’s largest immigrant detention system. Frey argues that instead of locking immigrants up, the United States should promote economic development in the countries from which they come, create legal work programs in the United States, and properly staff U.S. immigration courts."

In contrast to more vulnerable nations where authoritarian populists have triumphed—although not as frequently as alarmists often suggest—the United States has strong institutions, and the U.S. Constitution is notoriously difficult to amend. The United States’ well-established two-party system and its deep civil society and independent media have resisted Trump’s power grabs. And the very political polarization that helped Trump win office impedes him from gathering the overwhelming majority he would need to engineer a radical transformation. Moreover, Trump has not so far faced a crisis that he could use to mobilize majoritarian support, and even a national security blowup is likely to boost his popularity only briefly. At the same time, Weyland and Madrid recognize that serious shortcomings, including political gridlock, the undue influence of money in politics, and rising social inequality could eventually destabilize U.S. democracy. They suggest, however, that Trump’s norm-breaking behavior could generate “a democratic backlash” that rejuvenates liberal institutions."

Mathieu obsessively packs this introduction to their history with facts about human interaction with the mountains. He describes how people began visiting them to hunt and gather 50,000 years ago and built the first continuous settlements among them 15,000 years ago—culminating in the surprising range of churches and monasteries that dot the mountain range’s peaks and valleys today. Ever since 218 BC, when Hannibal drove his army over the Alps, most Europeans have viewed them as an inert barrier to travel and commerce. A few hundred years ago, elite climbers began tackling the Alpine slopes, joined by tourists and writers in search of the sublime. More recently, governments have cooperated to preserve the distinctive Alpine culture and natural environment, which remains a monument to mutually beneficial interaction between man and mountain."

In the last days of the Weimar Republic, Germany faced a punishing international economic environment: a financial crisis was radiating outward from the United States, and Germany’s opponents in World War I continued to demand reparations. Market pressure forced the German government to impose austerity by lowering wages, raising taxes, and slashing government spending. This triggered a wave of dissatisfaction with establishment political parties and made the half-truths in Hitler’s radical critique of democratic government and the Treaty of Versailles seem plausible. That, in turn, allowed the Nazi Party, up to that point a fringe group, to win enough votes to enter government. The lesson for today’s policymakers is all too clear. When establishing the euro, technocrats and politicians ignored the possible domestic political consequences of supranational economic choices, with disastrous results."

Indeed, the book belongs to a distinct genre of journalism that has recently emerged, in which a distinguished member of the chattering classes sallies out from London, New York, or a university town to record (for metropolitan consumption) the thoughts and feelings of populist sympathizers in the hinterland. Meek, an editor at the London Review of Books, visits a fishing village, a farming town, a former Cadbury chocolate factory, and an urban medical complex. He relates colorful and engaging tales of such places that his readers rarely visit and of the common folk who live there. He concludes that British supporters of leaving the EU view themselves as heirs to the legacy of Saint George: they must slay a foreign dragon, regardless of the practical consequences. It is tempting to think that such stories accurately capture the decisive sources of support for Brexit and other populist movements, but it is impossible to know for sure. More interesting is Meek’s own left-wing analysis of the EU, which ignores local prejudices and instead highlights foreign investment, battles over government subsidies, industrial decline, labor shortages, and other reasons for mass discontent among the older and more rural citizens of the United Kingdom."

Van Middelaar, now a political theorist, worked as a speechwriter for Herman Van Rompuy, the president of the European Council, from 2010 to 2014. He repackages the EU establishment consensus in prose largely free of jargon and footnotes. He convincingly shows that the EU has been surprisingly successful at managing crises—although, in keeping with the conventional wisdom in Brussels, he suggests some moderate reforms designed to bolster its power and legitimacy. The book is less persuasive in its overarching explanation for the EU’s success: that, when push comes to shove in Brussels, “politics trumps economics,” thereby purportedly overcoming opposition to integration by special interests. This is the story leaders in Brussels tell. Yet what van Middelaar’s narrative actually reveals is how European leaders, buffeted by market forces and regulatory failures, craft pragmatic responses to real-world problems in pursuit of their enduring national interests. Although this is not the technocratic world dreamed of by economists, it is also far from one in which politics reigns supreme over economics."

The authors, three legal academics and a celebrated economist, charge that the eurozone’s technocratic obscurantism and self-defeating tendency toward austerity exacerbate inequality, right-wing populism, and Euroskepticism. They propose to counteract these forces by greatly increasing fiscal transfers between EU countries. To do so, they recommend that the EU create a powerful new transnational parliament composed of national parliamentarians. This body would, they hope, supplant existing institutions and allow for transfers of wealth from richer EU countries to poorer ones. Yet none of this has the slightest chance of being realized, and even if it were, it would hardly be sufficient to offset the harm done by the euro. Recent experience and social science findings, moreover, belie the idealistic notion that referendums and parliamentary elections automatically legitimate policies. The proposal is important chiefly because it illustrates the utter failure of Europe’s center-left social democrats—caught between their pro-federalist beliefs and the realities of international economic cooperation—to craft coherent and viable proposals for renewing the EU."
55,An American in Cairo,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/review-essay/2019-08-12/american-cairo,An American in Cairo,"Peter Hessler, the author of several award-winning books on China, spent late 2011 to 2016 in Egypt, reporting for The New Yorker. His new book, which collects and expands on his magazine essays, is destined to become the title that all first-time visitors to Egypt are urged to pack, slipped neatly between their guide to the Egyptian Museum and the itinerary of their Nile cruise."
56,The Internet Freedom League,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/world/internet-freedom-league,The Internet Freedom League,"The early days of the Internet inspired a lofty dream: authoritarian states, faced with the prospect of either connecting to a new system of global communication or being left out of it, would choose to connect. According to this line of utopian thinking, once those countries connected, the flow of new information and ideas from the outside world would inexorably pull them toward economic openness and political liberalization. In reality, something quite different has happened. Instead of spreading democratic values and liberal ideals, the Internet has become the backbone of authoritarian surveillance states all over the world. Regimes in China, Russia, and elsewhere have used the Internet’s infrastructure to build their own national networks. At the same time, they have installed technical and legal barriers to prevent their citizens from reaching the wider Internet and to limit Western companies from entering their digital markets."
57,The India Dividend,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/india/2019-08-12/india-dividend,The India Dividend,"For two decades, Washington has had high hopes for India on the global stage. Gigantic, populous, and resource rich, India is, by all appearances, a superpower in waiting. And as the world’s largest democracy, it promises—according to those hopes—to be a crucial U.S. partner at a time of rising competition from authoritarian challengers."
58,The Old World and the Middle Kingdom,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2019-08-12/old-world-and-middle-kingdom,The Old World and the Middle Kingdom,"Europe is beginning to face up to the challenges posed by a rising China. From the political debates roiling European capitals over the Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei’s involvement in building 5G mobile networks to the tense EU-China summit earlier this year, recent events have shown that European leaders are growing uneasy in a relationship that until recently both sides saw as immensely beneficial. They worry about the political influence China has gained, especially over the EU’s smaller members, and its growing economic clout and technological prowess. They are starting, tentatively, to push back."
59,The Vigilante President,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/philippines/2019-08-12/vigilante-president,The Vigilante President,"In his final year in law school at a Catholic men’s college in Manila, Rodrigo Duterte shot a classmate who made fun of his thick accent. The young “Rody,” as Duterte was then known, was the son of a provincial governor on the southern Philippine island of Mindanao. Like many of the progeny of the Philippine political elite, he had enjoyed a privileged upbringing. He grew up surrounded by guns and bodyguards, flew his father’s plane when he was in his hometown, and hung out with the sons of local notables in his Jesuit-run boys’ school. In Manila, however, Duterte’s accent, typical of those from the country’s southern periphery, marked him as an unsophisticated provinciano. Hence the classmate’s teasing."
60,The Return of Doomsday,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/russian-federation/2019-08-06/return-doomsday,The Return of Doomsday,"The year is 2020. The Russian military is conducting a large exercise in Kaliningrad, a Russian exclave on the Baltic Sea that borders the NATO member states Lithuania and Poland. An observer aircraft from the Western alliance accidentally crosses into Russian airspace and is shot down by a surface-to-air missile. NATO rushes air squadrons and combat vessels into the region. Both sides warn that they will consider using nuclear weapons if their vital interests are threatened."
61,The Sources of Chinese Conduct,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2019-08-12/sources-chinese-conduct,The Sources of Chinese Conduct,"In February 1946, as the Cold War was coming into being, George Kennan, the chargé d’affaires at the U.S. embassy in Moscow, sent the State Department a 5,000-word cable in which he tried to explain Soviet behavior and outline a response to it. A year later, the text of his famous “Long Telegram” was expanded into a Foreign Affairs article, “The Sources of Soviet Conduct.” Writing under the byline “X,” Kennan argued that the Soviets’ Marxist-Leninist ideology was for real and that this worldview, plus a deep sense of insecurity, was what drove Soviet expansionism. But this didn’t mean that outright confrontation was inevitable, he pointed out, since “the Kremlin has no compunction about retreating in the face of superior force.” What the United States had to do to ensure its own long-term security, then, was contain the Soviet threat. If it did, then Soviet power would ultimately crumble. Containment, in other words, was both necessary and sufficient."
62,Competition Without Catastrophe,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/competition-with-china-without-catastrophe,Competition Without Catastrophe,"The United States is in the midst of the most consequential rethinking of its foreign policy since the end of the Cold War. Although Washington remains bitterly divided on most issues, there is a growing consensus that the era of engagement with China has come to an unceremonious close. The debate now is over what comes next."
63,Erdogan’s Way,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/turkey/2019-08-12/erdogans-way,Erdogan’s Way,"Recep Tayyip Erdogan is the most baffling politician to emerge in the 96-year history of Turkey. He is polarizing and popular, autocratic and fatherly, calculating and listless. Erdogan’s ideology shifts every few years, and he appears to make up his road map as he goes along. He is short-tempered: he grabs cigarette packs from citizens to try to force them into quitting, scolds reporters who ask tough questions, and once walked off the stage after an angry exchange with the Israeli president at the World Economic Forum in Davos. But he can also be extremely patient. It has taken him 16 years to forge what he calls “the new Turkey,” an economically self-reliant country with a marginalized opposition and a subservient press."
64,The Transformer,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/hungary/2019-08-12/transformer,The Transformer,"In the summer of 1989, the Soviet Union was beginning to falter, and its grasp on Eastern Europe was slipping. But in Hungary, the Soviets were hardly gone yet: Moscow still maintained around 70,000 soldiers, 1,000 tanks, and 1,500 armored vehicles there. Janos Kadar, who had built and led the repressive, Soviet-aligned regime that had run the country for the past three decades, had resigned the previous year, as the economy sputtered and Kadar himself struggled with cancer. But the regime centered on Kadar’s Hungarian Socialist Workers’ Party remained intact and still presided over an immense security apparatus and a network of armed militias."
65,Putin the Great,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/russian-federation/2019-08-12/putin-great,Putin the Great,"On January 27, 2018, Vladimir Putin became the longest-serving leader of Russia since Joseph Stalin. There were no parades or fireworks, no embarrassingly gilded statues unveiled or unseemly displays of nuclear missiles in Red Square. After all, Putin did not want to be compared with Leonid Brezhnev, the bushy-browed septuagenarian whose record in power he had just surpassed. Brezhnev, who ruled the Soviet Union from 1964 to 1982, was the leader of Putin’s gritty youth, of the long stagnation that preceded the empire’s collapse. By the end, he was the butt of a million jokes, the doddering grandfather of a doddering state, the conductor of a Russian train to nowhere. “Stalin proved that just one person could manage the country,” went one of those many jokes. “Brezhnev proved that a country doesn’t need to be managed at all.”"

1,Africa's Infrastructure: A Time for Transformation,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2010-05-01/africas-infrastructure-time-transformation,Africa’s Infrastructure: A Time for Transformation,"It will be the standard empirical source on African infrastructure for the foreseeable future. According to the report, the public infrastructure in most African countries increasingly lags behind those of poor countries in other regions -- in part due to Africa's difficult geography, but largely thanks to governments' and private actors' chronic underspending. For instance, in 1970, Africa's per capita power generating capacity was three times as great as South Asia's; now, it is less than half as great. Lagging infrastructure, the report estimates, depresses firms' productivity by about 40 percent. The solution, it suggests, is to more than double infrastructure spending from present levels. Given that total investment in Africa's infrastructure has already doubled over the last decade, this only confirms the depth of the problem.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

FIFA, the sanctioning international governing structure, sold television rights to the event for over $3 billion. But will hosting the World Cup benefit the average South African? This collection of essays by South African academics and policy experts provides some tentative answers. In particular, it assesses the event's impact on the nine big cities where matches will be held. For the most part, the contributors are skeptical about the economic benefits; previous World Cup host countries saw only minimal net increases in tourism, and the overall economic gains are unlikely to compensate for the enormous cost of building new sports stadiums and improving urban infrastructure (notably, public transportation). Nonetheless, the contributors praise the selected cities for coming up with pragmatic strategies to maximize the long-term benefits of the resources they have received for hosting the month-long event. The main gain from holding a successful World Cup, they conjecture, will be South Africa's improved global image.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

It is in the United Nations, which counts more member countries from Africa in the General Assembly (53) than from any other region, where these governments have pursued their most active diplomacy. As the large and sometimes unwieldy volume edited by Adebajo notes, much of the regional diplomacy against South African apartheid was coordinated through the UN, and a disproportionate share of UN organizations' activities, from development assistance to peacekeeping, concern Africa. The collection's early chapters focus on the core institutions of the UN; a second section addresses its peacekeeping and human rights operations in the region; and a third, more sprawling section covers the Africa-focused activities of 12 different UN bodies."
4,The Ethiopian Revolution: War in the Horn of Africa,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2010-05-01/ethiopian-revolution-war-horn-africa,The Ethiopian Revolution: War in the Horn of Africa,"Tareke's perceptive and readable history of contemporary Ethiopia and its violent conflicts is billed as a military history. But only the last third of the book provides the kind of detailed description of military campaigns that would qualify it as such. There, making judicious use of extensive internal Ethiopian military records and interviews with key officers, Tareke recounts the major battles that Mengistu Haile Mariam's regime fought and lost against the Eritrean and Tigrayan guerrilla movements during the Ogaden War against Somalia in 1977-78 and during the 1980s. The first two thirds of the book place these battles in their context, analyzing the country's political dynamics since the 1970s. Tareke blames the downfall of Mengistu's communist dictatorship on its repeated purges of public officials, which weakened the military and left too many mediocre sycophants in charge of state institutions. Tareke also dissects the Eritrean and Tigrayan secessionist movements and investigates the sources of their battlefield victories. In Eritrea, the single-minded discipline of the secessionist movement's leaders -- particularly the country's current strongman, Isaias Afwerki -- helped account for its resilience and military success. But it also explains the movement's dogmatism in power and the authoritarian stagnation of the independent nation it created.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."
5,The Struggle for Tibet; Tibet's Last Stand?

The Tibetan Uprising of 2008 and China’s Response,"What first catches one's attention in The Struggle for Tibet, a collection of back-and-forth articles by Wang (an independent Chinese intellectual) and Shakya (a Tibetan academic living in exile), is Shakya's blistering response to Wang's initial effort to understand the Tibetan frame of mind. Since Wang is the most sympathetic Han scholar writing on the issue, the exchange testifies to the gap between the two ethnic groups. The issues at stake (summarized in an introduction by  Robert Barnett) are fundamental -- such as what geographic unit constitutes Tibet, whether modernization is good or bad for the Tibetans, whether resistance is self-generated or incited from abroad, and whether the Dalai Lama is a religious or a political figure. As the dialogue proceeds, both authors converge on the view that Han Chinese rule in Tibet is infused with old-fashioned colonialist attitudes of racial and cultural superiority, including contempt for the Tibetans' religion. It is not so much the struggle for sovereignty as the struggle for respect that drives Tibetan resistance, which persists despite improvements in Tibet's economic conditions. Unfortunately, the March 2008 demonstrations in the Tibetan Autonomous Region and other Tibetan-populated areas of China and the vitriolic popular Han response have further polarized ethnic antagonisms."

In Islamism and Democracy in India, an exploration of the Jamaat-e-Islami (Party  of Islam) movement in India and its student movement offshoot, the anthropologist Ahmad shows how political Islam adapts its tactics (and even its ideology) to political circumstances. Because the religious neutrality of the Indian political system served its constituents' interests, the movement became a supporter of secular democracy. The student offshoot, however, responded to the rise of Hindu fundamentalism by going radical, through a process of internal struggle that Ahmad describes."

Beijing's ""market authoritarian model,"" as Halper calls it, looks increasingly attractive compared to the faltering liberal capitalist model. Even though no other authoritarian state has the organizational resources to model itself fully on China, many are emboldened to try their own homebrews of repression and state capitalism. Disagreeing with those who think that a search for respectability will lead China to scale back its relations with rogue states, Halper argues that Beijing is locked into such relationships due to its dependence on natural resources. Likewise, he doubts that China will democratize as it grows richer, because it is wealth that underwrites the regime's legitimacy. In Halper's telling, the real threat facing the West is the West's own failure to practice and promote its values. Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

Demick interviewed six citizens from a single small town who had defected. Rich in context and detail, the book provides a riveting account of how a functioning totalitarian system decayed into a land of starvation. Each individual was subjected to multiple vectors of fear -- for his career, his freedom, and his life. Demick explores the double-mindedness that political repression creates, when the prudent self helps the regime force the doubting self to keep quiet. As their belief in the Kim dynasty fell apart, these North Koreans went through a lonely, painful process. The careful objectivity of its author makes this compulsively readable, intimate story of fear, conformity, starvation, and flight all the more moving."

He shows Islam as a sister religion to Judaism and Christianity and as equally diverse. And he addresses the hot-button questions suspicious Westerners pose about Islam and Muslims; the book's section headings include ""Muslims in the West: Can They Be Loyal Citizens?"" ""Is Islam Capable of Reform?"" and ""What About Women's Rights?"" The result is a sort of comparative religion catechism. Although Osama bin Laden and his ilk are given their space, Esposito  devotes many more words to modernists and mainline Muslims. (He also introduces Islam's ""Billy Grahams,"" the several successful Muslim televangelists.) Some scholars and secularists would say that Esposito's interpretation of Islam and Muslims today is too rosy. But he rightly shows that Islam and Muslims are not some strange and frightening ""other."""

The authors break down the ups and downs of these contending forces by decade: the 1980s belonged to the clerics, the 1990s to the Bonyads (charitable foundations), and the first decade of this century to the Revolutionary Guards. They interpret the political struggle as pitting revolutionary Iran (""a model of resistance and self-sufficiency"") against republican Iran (""a model of a normal state""), with the former on the rise since the June 2009 presidential election. The United States, the authors conclude, would be well advised to appreciate this constellation of forces shaping Iranian foreign policy.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

It is a convincing argument, but is the story of those years best told in terms of the use and abuse of international law? True, states and would-be states usually present their actions in terms of law and justice, and the ensuing discourse is a useful part of the historical record. And yet, the United Kingdom's contradictory commitments to the Zionists and the Arabs are better understood using a realist, rather than a legal, reconstruction. The same would hold for making sense of the mandate system, the partition plans for Palestine, and the intensive U.S. involvement of 1946-48. Ironically, plaintiffs putting others on trial in that elusive court of international law risk being diverted from adopting policies more likely to succeed. Kattan, moreover, presents the problem too much in terms of outside actors (""It was European anti-Semitism and British colonialism which caused the conflict in Palestine""). This unduly downplays the role of those Zionists/Israelis and Arabs who were intimately involved. Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

Yet the problems recounted in this career diplomat's down-to-earth memoir are so severe that it reads as if he had been the first. Not much was settled in the task of putting together a post-Taliban Afghan state, and there was a disturbing continued Taliban presence. Neumann chronicles the Afghan government's sluggish policymaking process, the country's woefully inadequate infrastructure, Washington's miserly budgeting, NATO's problems of coordination, and the U.S. embassy's delicate chore of supporting Afghan President Hamid Karzai without dominating him. Neumann comes across as a hands-on diplomat, careful to avoid settling scores (only former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld receives explicit criticism) and understated in appraising his own record. When it comes to the future of Afghanistan, Neumann's take is measured: he is optimistic about the possibility of success.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

His scientific achievements, including his role in the development of Soviet nuclear weapons, along with his courage and prominence as a political dissident, guarantee that. Bergman, however, introduces a figure who transcends Russian history. Sakharov's faith in reason, originally limited to the sphere of nuclear weapons, gradually acquired a moral sensibility stirred by the ethical implications of testing these weapons in the atmosphere, a step that led to a far more profound concern with the whole sphere of human rights. Bergman opens Sakharov's mind to the reader and illustrates how Sakharov bonded reason with ethics and applied ideas not only to an astonishing range of technical scientific subjects but also, ultimately, to matters of human freedom and world peace. This makes Sakharov of greater philosophical interest, and the book, an excellent companion to Richard Lourie's earlier sterling biography.

Perritt comes as close as an outsider can to opening doors into the chambers where the political forces of Belgrade and Pristina tangled and diplomats from Russia, the EU, and the United States struggled to craft the least destabilizing disposition of Kosovo nearly ten years after the NATO-led war broke Serbia's hold over it. His account makes plain that independence (and not just some form of autonomy or partition) was in the cards from the start. But to get there without running over the Russians and, if possible, while reconciling the Serbs and holding the EU constituency together was no mean diplomatic feat. In the end, only the last of these objectives was achieved. Sympathetic as Perritt is to the Kosovars' cause, he notes how much uncertainty persists about future Russian behavior, the prospects of an independent Kosovo, and the ability of the UN Security Council to deal with the next comparable crisis.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

No, says Lieven, the Russian government itself defeated Napoleon, and it did so because Tsar Alexander I and his war minister had anticipated the war, knew the enemy and his weaknesses, and had designed a superior strategy. ""From the start,"" Lieven writes, ""their plan was to wear down Napoleon by a defensive campaign in Russia, and then to pursue the defeated enemy back over the frontier and raise a European insurrection against him."" Hence, the importance of the years 1813-14. This was the decisive phase of the Napoleonic Wars, but it has been neglected thanks to self-serving retellings found in British, French, and Prussian histories and in later Russian novels and musical overtures. Lieven not only makes his case in rich, probing detail; he also encases it in a fluent reading of Russia's larger political and social dynamics during this period.

One is the large, shapeless issues of nationalism, ethnic politics, and social violence and the indirectly related phenomenon of communism's demise in Eastern Europe. The other is the way scholars conceive nationalism and theorize about its consequences. He tackles these issues broadly, dealing with not only places where nationalism is ascendant but also places where it has fizzled and addressing not just collective violence on a grand scale, such as the Balkan wars, but also mass mobilizations short of war, such as the periodic violence in the Indian states of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. His treatment of the fall of communism in Eastern Europe and the disintegration of the Soviet Union is thoughtful but somewhat tenuously linked to the book's core themes. Each step of the way, he reflects on the state of the study of nationalism, beginning with the early, mostly British thinkers who carved out the field. If their ideas endure largely unimproved, it is, he suggests, because their rich, historically grounded approach and readiness to borrow across disciplines have given way to studies more concerned with the rigorous manipulation of data than an expansive notion of evidence, and more concerned with the application of formal theory than unfettered imagination.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

Never before have his mind, habits, quirks, and passions been so well portrayed as in this book. Lenin's five years in power are crucial to Russian history, but the 25 years before -- most spent dodging the Russian secret police while fleeing back and forth across Europe -- are critical to understanding him and his conspiratorial movement. The events of these years have been recounted a thousand times, but Rappaport penetrates beyond them by trailing after Lenin, his utterly devoted wife, Nadezhda Krupskaya, and the sundry young Russian revolutionaries who collected about him in an endless succession of one-room furnitureless apartments, makeshift meeting places, and furtive printing centers. Lenin comes to life as he frequents the streets, cafés, and reading rooms of Geneva, Munich, London, Zurich, Paris, and Stockholm; hikes the Swiss mountains; and plots the revolution's dawn with a shrinking band of tolerated associates.

That is not Laruelle's take. She sees nationalism as a natural, albeit conflicted, mix of symbols and notions that society uses to stake out a workable identity and that politicians use to connect with society. She makes her case by surveying the nationalist urgings in Russia in three political clusters: parties at either extreme of the spectrum that eschew participation in the conventional political process; opposition parties that do take part in the system but favor populist appeals, such as the Communist Party and the Liberal Democratic Party; and the dominant party, United Russia, the bearer of Prime Minister Vladimir Putin's vision. She also fits in the Russian Orthodox Church and the military. In her careful reconstruction, important differences exist between these contending nationalisms, but they ultimately all yield to xenophobia and patriotism -- for now, the common denominator.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

The veterans warn that such idealism will eventually be shattered by the defensive double-dealing that is endemic to Brazilian foreign policy. Vigevani and Cepaluni help explain why this is so, untangling the three main quests that have guided Brazilian foreign policy at various times: for ""autonomy through distance"" from a liberalizing international order, for ""autonomy through participation"" in international forums, and for ""autonomy through diversification"" of relations -- combined with the ever-present quest for autonomy from the United States. Brazil's powerful Foreign Ministry, Itamaraty, seems to give little thought to discovering cooperative solutions to common international problems. Although generally sympathetic to Itamaraty, the co-authors do note the inherent tension between its pursuit of a freer hand in global affairs and Brazil's aspirations to become a regional leader -- a position that would require it to accept some constraints imposed by regional partners. A more critical assessment of Itamaraty would also draw attention to its hankering for procedural formalities and prestige of place over concrete results and its anachronistic domination by elite white males in a young, multiracial society.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

In these complimentary volumes, two mature social scientists provide compelling counterperspectives that add sophistication, humanity, and hope to what is understood about urban poverty in Latin America. Perlman returned repeatedly to the famed slums of Rio de Janeiro to follow four generations of residents over 40 years. She writes with compassion, artistry, and intelligence, using stirring personal stories to illustrate larger points substantiated with statistical analysis. Not all of her subjects find paths out of poverty, but Perlman chronicles an overall improvement in living standards and a surprising degree of upward social mobility, especially among families with fewer children. She discovers many innovative social interventions (by community organizers, nongovernmental organizations, and international agencies) that, if replicated, could have widespread benefits."

Yet the persistent and extreme social stratification by skin color has exploded the dominant myth of Brazilian ""racial democracy,"" of Brazil as a color-blind paradise in the tropics. As democracy has taken root, Brazilians have become more self-critical, and  in 2001 the government instituted a policy of affirmative action for Afro-Brazilians in university admissions. This reform introduced an incentive for blacks to identify themselves as such. The scholar-activists writing in Brazil's New Racial Politics find that not all Afro-Brazilians vote for black candidates but that those who embrace their blackness tend to do so, suggesting that blacks may begin to be better represented in electoral politics. Certainly, the activist nongovernmental organizations and black hip-hop artists examined here very much hope that the quality and diversity of Brazilian democracy will continue their forward march."

Her research is indefatigable (she took 12 trips to the island); her access, remarkably wide; and her opinions, centrist and considered. Particularly interesting are her mappings of the multiple extended families of the Castro brothers (including Fidel's ten children). Bardach paints a rather positive portrait of Raúl, as a man who, compared with his older brother, is less charismatic and more institutional, and perhaps relatively more pragmatic.

When the ""Celtic tiger"" was growing by close to ten percent per year, floating on foreign investment to a per capita income above that of its old imperial neighbor, many extolled the unique virtues of the Irish. Yet just as in Japan, Italy, the United States, and elsewhere, when the boom ended in Ireland, it inevitably uncovered a toxic combination of lax regulation, property speculation, and political corruption. Wealthy land speculators had cornered urban markets, driving housing prices up by 500 percent in a decade. Bankers on the take had provided the financing, and corrupt politicians had facilitated tax evasion. State assets were sold for a song. Now Ireland's GDP is shrinking fast, its housing prices are in free fall, its banking system has collapsed, and its gross indebtedness outstrips that of Japan. O'Toole's argument is that Ireland, like other rapidly developing countries, went too quickly from a premodern economy to a postmodern one based on free-market ideology while retaining the essentially clientelistic politics of the past. To this day, corruption in Ireland remains unpunished, and Irish politics, unreformed.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

Euroskeptics -- including a former president of Germany (Roman Herzog), Tory politicians in the United Kingdom, and obliging journalists and columnists around the continent -- have propagated the myth that 80 percent of the EU countries' new laws and regulations originate with the EU. Their protests have fueled movements to democratize EU institutions, limit the scope of the EU's policy activities, or populate the European Parliament with right-wing extremists. Now comes Bertoncini's book, a comprehensive policy study with real numbers. It turns out that only 12 percent of French laws from 1987 to 2006 originated in Brussels, a proportion that is actually declining. Why so low?

27,The New Old World,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2010-05-01/new-old-world,The New Old World,"In the era of blogs, sound bites, and op-eds, Anderson is an old-fashioned intellectual. A British historian who teaches at UCLA, his preferred medium is the 50- to 70-page essay, in which he summarizes and critiques the best historical and theoretical literature on a subject. One might think that such an approach would generate dry academic debates of little interest to practitioners. Yet Anderson is among the most insightful and policy-relevant analysts of modern Europe -- even if he tends at times to exaggerate the pessimistic. His essays in The New Old World -- on France, Germany, Italy, Cyprus, Turkey, and, above all, the European Union -- combine a Marxist's hardheaded appreciation for the centrality of economic and political self-interest with a traditional historian's sense of detail and contingency. Typical is Anderson's masterful chapter on Turkey. It explains, more lucidly than any comparable work, how the domestic and international options that face politicians in this critical country are decisively shaped by a century of historical influences."

As McCleary demonstrates, the relationship between the government and these private charities has varied over time: from outright government licensing and control of their activities (during World War II) to formal and informal partnerships (during much of the Cold War), to tense and sometimes conflicted relations (as in Afghanistan and Iraq today). The private-public connection raises complex political and managerial issues, as a thicket of competing bureaucratic and commercial interests create enormous inefficiencies and bitter conflicts in the aid and development ""business."" Large private voluntary organizations lobby Congress for favored programs, different religious and ethnic groups compete for shares of the aid pie, and the increasing role of the Department of Defense in development work further muddies the waters.

Polk, the Mexican War, and the Conquest of the American Continent","Merry's extraordinary study of the Polk administration succeeds on two levels. First, it brilliantly accomplishes its primary task of gathering together various elements of U.S. politics to present a clear narrative account of the tenure of one of the most important but least studied figures in U.S. history. Second, it pulls off the far more difficult feat of making the history and politics of a faraway period useful to contemporary readers. James Polk's administration was dominated by the Mexican-American War, a conflict primarily remembered in the United States today as an easy, if morally tainted, victory. Merry demolishes the cakewalk view of the war, demonstrating just how politically tortuous and risky Polk's path to victory really was, and how large a role luck (and quiet British diplomatic assistance) played in the triumph. At the same time, he qualifies the conventional view of Mexico as the innocent victim of cold-blooded aggression and avarice. Arrogance and fecklessness marked Mexico's approach to its dangerous neighbor, and the Mexican catastrophe was brought on as much by Mexico's own reckless folly as by American greed.

Fast paced, detailed, and intelligently organized, Game Change not only reveals the inner deliberations of the leading candidates and their teams during one of the country's most remarkable presidential campaigns; it illuminates the state of American democracy and perhaps even of the American soul. The portraits of the Clintons are riveting. The dysfunctional and deeply flawed Edwardses are flayed and filleted. And the two most meteoric figures in the campaign, Barack Obama and Sarah Palin, are beautifully portrayed in all their complexity. Reading the book so long after the campaign is a bittersweet experience. As Obama has now settled into the harsh task of governing, some of the promise and appeal he displayed as a candidate now seems far away. In any case, if the health of American democracy is in question at the moment, Heilemann and Halperin demonstrate that the art of political journalism is flourishing as never before."

The United Kingdom and France were the European powers most intimately concerned with the war. Both had large textile industries dependent on Southern cotton and close commercial ties with the North. The United Kingdom also had substantial holdings in the Americas, and France sought the same. The Lincoln administration, whose initial military blunders led the United Kingdom to hedge its bets and recognize the Confederacy as a belligerent, frequently misunderstood British aims. Overall, however, the North's diplomacy was more realistic and consistent than any effort the South could manage. As Jones makes plain, the Confederacy's inability before and during the war to understand its international vulnerabilities played no small part in its defeat.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

Wills offers a well-honed example of this classic genre, focusing on the rise of presidential power and the national security state from the time of President Franklin Roosevelt to the Obama administration. Wills is correct in much of what he says; for virtually all of the last 60 years, the United States has lived in a state of emergency, brought on by one crisis after another. First came World War II, then the Cold War, and now the conflict formerly known as the war on terror. Wills is right that presidential power has vastly expanded during these two generations and that the existence of the atom bomb has contributed to the trend. What he spends less time examining is the persistence of freedom and political debate even in the shadow of a powerful security state. It seems unlikely that jackbooted secret police will be calling Wills to account for this spirited attack on the foundations of executive power anytime soon. Let us hope that he and his fellow Jeremiahs can continue unmolested to chastise the overmighty executive for many years to come.

Thus, the British integrated deception into the highest levels of strategic planning during the two world wars, and with considerable success. Some of the escapades became famous: phony units with pretend tanks, a double of General Bernard Montgomery arriving in Gibraltar to discuss fake operations, a corpse washing up on the Spanish shore dressed as a top officer with secret plans. These ruses were intended to persuade the Germans that invasions were to take place well away from their planned locations. By and large, they worked. When the Allies landed in Sicily and Normandy, the Germans were looking the wrong way. Rankin's page-turner makes the most of the gifted amateurs, eccentrics, and professional illusionists responsible for these imaginative schemes and details the care and seriousness with which they were implemented. But one of the story's key points actually hinges on Germany's, or, more specifically, Hitler's, gullibility: deception works best when the target is ready to be deceived.

In some respects, it was a sideshow to World War II, the main event being in Europe. Germany only became involved to rescue the Italians, but then General Erwin Rommel's dash and flair raised the possibility of humiliating the British. The result was that German forces became overextended and scarce resources were diverted to the desert campaigns, which still ended in defeat. Thanks to Kitchen's meticulous research, there is now a compelling account of the battles from a German perspective, with a well-rounded and not altogether flattering picture of Rommel. The book gives due weight to both his operational brilliance, especially in retreat, and his poor strategic judgment. Ultimately, Rommel undermined himself by banking on his special relationship with Hitler to offset his differences with those above and below him in the chain of command.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

Q. Khan used his position at a uranium-enrichment consortium in the Netherlands to acquire the information and contacts he needed to help his country build nuclear weapons. Khan later turned his network into an instrument of proliferation, assisting would-be nuclear powers with basic plans and infrastructure. These stories have been told before, but Albright is on top of the material and conveys the underlying scientific and engineering issues with lucidity and authority. He sketches the links among Iran, Iraq, North Korea, and Libya and, more alarming, throws light on what al Qaeda was up to while it enjoyed sanctuary in Afghanistan. The book is particularly good at tracing the movement of technology and uncovering how proliferators circumvented export controls and confused intelligence agencies -- for example, by using split orders and complex payment schemes to obscure why and how particular components were bought and sold. At times, following this trail can be as challenging to the reader as it was to the agencies, but Albright is undoubtedly right to emphasize that specialist manufacturers, the best placed to pick up the signs of dubious enterprises, should be enlisted to keep watch.

His jet-black beard and round spectacles gave him the aura of a soft-spoken professor, not a battle-hardened guerrilla fighter who had first tasted war at the age of 15. Zaeef told me about his childhood in southern Afghanistan, the Soviet invasion, his life with the Taliban, and the three years he spent in prison in Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. What was particularly striking was his contempt for the United States and what he regarded as its myopic understanding of Afghanistan. ""How long has America been in Afghanistan?"" Zaeef asked rhetorically. ""And how much do Americans know about Afghanistan and its people? Do they understand its culture, its tribes, and its population? I am afraid they know very little."""

In his latest book, he considers the prominent role of civilians in contemporary conflicts -- including wars initiated to protect the welfare of oppressed civilians and those in which enemies use noncombatants as shields or targets. Against such unrestrained enemies, Western countries face the dilemma of whether to abandon their past prohibitions on such practices as torture and assassination. Gross traces the processes by which exceptions, such as ""enhanced interrogation techniques"" and targeted killings, take hold and then start to become accepted, especially if they are considered effective. In exploring the ""constant interaction"" between military necessity and humanitarianism, he notes that traditional norms regarding the protection of combatants and noncombatants have considerable influence, even when governments start to slide down the slippery slope away from them.

Unlike in the area of foreign trade, in which the presumption that more freedom is good is generally acknowledged, this issue has never been definitively resolved by either academic economists or the policy community. The original Bretton Woods monetary system, established after World War II, permitted such controls; some would say that its fixed exchange rates even required them. But sentiment gradually shifted away from controls in the following decades, and resistance to controls perhaps reached its apogee when the European Economic Community abolished them in Europe in the late 1980s. A move soon developed to formally amend the international rules to make the free movement of capital an international objective. The effort received a setback with the Asian financial crisis of the late 1990s and again with the global financial crisis of 2008. This book, the outgrowth of a Ph.D. dissertation, usefully traces the evolution of the thinking about this issue at the International Monetary Fund, the international body most directly concerned with it.

Many of the examples he finds took place in British and French colonies in the Caribbean and in Asia, where locals resented metropolitan efforts to restrict trade or raise revenue. But they also include the failure of former Florida Governor Jeb Bush's wife to declare to U.S. Customs the results of a $19,000 shopping spree in Paris, for which she had to pay a fine of over $4,000. Karras discusses the intimate connection over the centuries between smuggling and the corruption of local officials, which, while strictly illegal, sometimes eased the life of local residents. In the end, Karras takes a tough position against smuggling, arguing that it corrodes legitimate government. But he pays too little attention to the content of the legal regimes that have made smuggling especially attractive, such as the eighteenth-century requirement that residents of European colonies trade only with the metropolitan power and not with those neighbors ruled by different colonial powers.

In all the cases, laws calling for the protection of particular parts of the environment were on the books. But government agencies either ignored the laws completely or treated them as a low priority. Often with incredible persistence, citizens challenged the government and, after establishing legal standing (sometimes no easy task), gradually persuaded courts to take decisions against government agencies -- something common enough in the United States but extremely unusual in many other countries, such as Japan and Russia.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

Poppy production has grown enormously in Afghanistan during the past decade, even while it has fallen in the ""golden triangle"" of Myanmar (also called Burma), Laos, and Thailand. Meanwhile, the United States has supported extensive eradication programs in several countries. This book traces the use of opium back to prehistoric times and sketches its complex and interesting history in Europe and especially in Asia, from ancient China and ancient Persia to modern times. It contends that opium production is intimately related to poverty and food insecurity, that eradication programs have inevitably failed to suppress opium production, and that the only way to reduce opium production is to address its economic and social sources by providing livelihoods superior to poppy production. Contrary to conventional wisdom, the labor-intensive production of opium is not highly lucrative to the poppy farmers; it does, however, compare favorably to alternative crops in the states where it is produced.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

By rough analogy with computers, it is the software rather than the hardware -- the intangible assets rather than the tangible -- that really makes a modern economy run: rules, customs, norms, standards, and, above all, entrepreneurship. These factors have raised societies' standards of living to previously unthinkable levels, improvements that are well documented in the book.

The Evolution of Territoriality in American Law,"Since the rise of the nation-state, law has been territorial, circumscribed by the sovereign boundaries of the state. But its geographic scope has always been contested -- and today, in controversies over Guantánamo and secret prisons, debates rage over the reach of U.S. law beyond the water's edge. Raustiala has written a masterful account of the United States' centuries-long legal and political struggle over extraterritoriality. He shows how throughout the modern age, even as Westphalian norms of legal sovereignty spread, European great powers were extending their laws to protect their own overseas citizens and create distinct legal categories for different parts of their empires. From these distinctions, Raustiala argues, ""we can trace, albeit unevenly, a route to the American naval base at Guantanamo Bay."" The book follows the many waves of debate over territory and law from the American Revolution to the post-World War II decades, when rapid economic growth and growing interdependence forced a retreat from strict interpretations of territoriality. More recently, the ""war on terror"" has triggered an even more contentious struggle between legal ideals and national security imperatives.

McFaul offers a spirited defense of democracy promotion as a necessary component of the United States' global strategy. He makes a compelling case that established democracies are unusually reliable partners and that when the United States has intervened to disrupt democratic change -- as it did in Iran in the 1953 coup -- its long-term security interests have suffered. The book acknowledges that democratization efforts in the Middle East have not produced more stable allies and that elections can bring anti-Western radicals to power, but McFaul counsels patience. His most important contribution is his sketch of a reformulated democracy-promotion agenda that would begin with the restoration of the ""American example,"" which was tarnished by Abu Ghraib and the ""war on terror"": the United States should tone down its grandiose rhetoric, renounce the use of force as a tool of democracy promotion, and engage autocracies. In the end, the specific promotion policies may matter less than the ability of the United States to provide security and open markets, both of which have historically created the most favorable conditions for democratic advancement.

Two experienced policy intellectuals, one liberal, one conservative, have come together to find common ground on a controversial foreign policy issue. Feinstein and Lindberg argue that the time has come to rethink U.S. opposition to the International Criminal Court. To date, the debate over the ICC in the United States has been divided between those who emphasize the ""global governance"" virtues of membership and those who, in opposing membership, wave the flag of sovereignty. But the ICC is a means, not an end -- after all, the goal is to hold perpetrators of atrocities to account for their deeds. To Feinstein and Lindberg, therefore, the case for the court must be made on more traditional grounds of American values and interests. Since its earliest days, the United States has championed universal norms and institutions of justice -- and the international court is simply an instrument of these cherished commitments. The authors contend that the court could also serve real national interests, for cooperation with it would improve relations with close allies and military partners.

Kupchan's magisterial accomplishment, drawing on an extraordinary range of theories and cases, is to provide an overarching account of when and why countries in conflict move toward stable peace. Kupchan sees this as a sequential process in which Hobbesian anarchy must be addressed before crafting the institutions prescribed by John Locke, which, in turn, allow for deeper political integration. The conditions that Kupchan identifies as critical for reconciliation are institutionalized restraints on power, compatible social orders, and cultural commonalities -- factors he explores in a wide array of instances of both failed and successful peace building (from mere peaceful coexistence to full-fledged unification). His intriguing finding is that social and cultural affinities are a more important ingredient of stable peace between former enemies than are democratic governments or deep economic ties.

Although the United States has always had a distinctive ideology of development and progress, he argues that a new synthesis of these ideas developed during the progressive movement and in the New Deal years. It was a vision of the United States as global leader, wielding technology and know-how, engaging in large-scale projects worldwide, and encouraging social and political progress abroad. Ekbladh traces its various threads from post-Civil War efforts at reconstruction to early-twentieth-century efforts at nation building in the Philippines and follows it into the 1920s, when the United States attempted to cultivate modern institutions in Latin America and elsewhere through education and the transfer of technology. The American ""style"" of progress crystallized in the 1940s when New Deal ideas about large-scale planning, groundbreaking technologies, and social transformation (ideas like those behind the Tennessee Valley Authority) emerged as the liberal alternative to fascist and communist models of advancement. The result was a U.S. doctrine of ""modernization,"" enshrined in the Truman Doctrine and the 1949 ""Point Four"" program of economic assistance to poor countries. Even though the liberal vision of modernization lost appeal amid the trauma of the Vietnam War, as Ekbladh's fascinating account makes clear, it remains deeply embedded in the American imagination.

In the 1970s and 1980s, however, countervailing trends briefly held sway. Smaller countries, such as Japan, West Germany, and the ""Asian tigers,"" attained international prominence as they grew faster than giants such as the United States and the Soviet Union. These smaller countries -- what I have called ""trading states"" -- did not have expansionist territorial ambitions and did not try to project military power abroad. While the United States was tangled up in Vietnam and the Soviet Union in Afghanistan, trading states concentrated on gaining economic access to foreign territories, rather than political control. And they were quite successful."

NATO's relationship with Russia is at the top of the agenda. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, the United States and its NATO allies have constructed a post-Cold War order that effectively shuts Russia out. Although NATO and the European Union have embraced the countries of central and eastern Europe, they have treated Russia as an outsider, excluding it from the main institutions of the Euro-Atlantic community. Russia's isolation is in part a product of its own making.

It is the struggle to avoid extortion or abuse by local police, the struggle against being forced into slavery or having land stolen, the struggle to avoid being thrown arbitrarily into an overcrowded, disease-ridden jail with little or no prospect of a fair trial. For women and children, it is the struggle not to be assaulted, raped, molested, or forced into the commercial sex trade."
58,Expeditionary Economics,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/chad/2010-05-01/expeditionary-economics,Expeditionary Economics,"The United States' experience with rebuilding economies in the aftermath of conflicts and natural disasters has evidenced serious shortcomings. After seven years of a U.S. presence in Iraq and over nine years in Afghanistan, the economies of those countries continue to falter and underperform. Meanwhile, the damage caused by the earthquake in Haiti early this year revealed deep economic problems, ones that had confronted earlier U.S. efforts to boost Haiti's economy, and they will plague reconstruction efforts there for a long while. Economic growth is critical to establishing social stability, which is the ultimate objective of these counterinsurgency campaigns and disaster-relief efforts. Various obstacles, such as insurgencies and inadequacies in infrastructure, have made economic development difficult in these countries, of course, but these difficulties cannot be blamed exclusively on such obstacles. A central element in the failure to establish robust economies in war-torn or disaster-stricken countries is the prevailing doctrine of international development, according to which strong economies cannot emerge in poor countries."
59,The Global Glass Ceiling,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/world/global-glass-ceiling,The Global Glass Ceiling,"Over the last several decades, it has become accepted wisdom that improving the status of women is one of the most critical levers of international development. When women are educated and can earn and control income, a number of good results follow: infant mortality declines, child health and nutrition improve, agricultural productivity rises, population growth slows, economies expand, and cycles of poverty are broken."
60,The Geography of Chinese Power,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2010-05-01/geography-chinese-power,The Geography of Chinese Power,"The English geographer Sir Halford Mackinder ended his famous 1904 article, ""The Geographical Pivot of History,"" with a disturbing reference to China. After explaining why Eurasia was the geostrategic fulcrum of world power, he posited that the Chinese, should they expand their power well beyond their borders, ""might constitute the yellow peril to the world's freedom just because they would add an oceanic frontage to the resources of the great continent, an advantage as yet denied to the Russian tenant of the pivot region."" Leaving aside the sentiment's racism, which was common for the era, as well as the hysterics sparked by the rise of a non-Western power at any time, Mackinder had a point: whereas Russia, that other Eurasian giant, basically was, and is still, a land power with an oceanic front blocked by ice, China, owing to a 9,000-mile temperate coastline with many good natural harbors, is both a land power and a sea power. (Mackinder actually feared that China might one day conquer Russia.) China's virtual reach extends from Central Asia, with all its mineral and hydrocarbon wealth, to the main shipping lanes of the Pacific Ocean. Later, in Democratic Ideals and Reality, Mackinder predicted that along with the United States and the United Kingdom, China would eventually guide the world by ""building for a quarter of humanity a new civilization, neither quite Eastern nor quite Western."""

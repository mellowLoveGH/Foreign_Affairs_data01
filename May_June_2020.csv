Only those major players can make a dent in global greenhouse gas emissions, the thinking goes, and only they can pool the necessary resources. Given the monumental scale of the coming climate crisis, anything short of such high-level mobilization seems inconsequential, even futile."
1,Britain Adrift,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-kingdom/2020-04-13/britain-adrift,Britain Adrift,"“Great Britain has lost an empire and has not yet found a role.” What might have appeared as an unexceptional observation by former U.S. Secretary of State Dean Acheson, made during a speech at West Point in December 1962, created an uproar in the United Kingdom. London’s Daily Express spoke of a “stab in the back.” British Prime Minister Harold Macmillan felt compelled to defend his country’s honor, writing in an open letter, “Mr. Acheson has fallen into an error which has been made by quite a lot of people in the course of the last four hundred years, including Philip of Spain, Louis XIV, Napoleon, the Kaiser and Hitler.”"
2,The Right Way to Fix the EU,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/world/right-way-fix-eu,The Right Way to Fix the EU,"On January 30, 2020, representatives from the European Union’s 28 member states gathered at the European Parliament, in Brussels, to approve the United Kingdom’s official exit from the EU. After the vote was cast, the parliamentarians from the 27 remaining members waved their British counterparts goodbye while singing “Auld Lang Syne,” the Scottish farewell song that celebrates lasting friendship and the passing from old times to new. Among the departing British, some wept tears of sorrow, others tears of joy."
3,The Next Iranian Revolution,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/middle-east/2020-04-13/next-iranian-revolution,The Next Iranian Revolution,"“Regime change” is a toxic phrase in Washington. It conjures up images of the Iraq war, with the United States trapped in a quagmire of its own making. That is why those who favor a coercive U.S. approach to Iran are routinely charged with secretly supporting regime change. In response, the accused almost always deny it. They don’t want regime change, they insist: they just want the Islamic Republic’s theocrats to change their behavior."
4,The Paths to Net Zero,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/world/paths-net-zero,The Paths to Net Zero,"For 30 years, diplomats and policymakers have called for decisive action on climate change—and for 30 years, the climate crisis has grown worse. There are a multitude of reasons for this failure. The benefits of climate action lie mostly in the future, they are diffuse and hard to pin down, and they will accrue above all to poor populations that do not have much of a voice in politics, whether in those countries that emit most of the world’s warming pollution or at the global level. The costs of climate action, on the other hand, are evident here and now, and they fall on well-organized interest groups with real political power. In a multipolar world without a responsible hegemon, any collective effort is difficult to organize. And the profound uncertainty about what lies ahead makes it hard to move decisively."
5,The End of Grand Strategy,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/world/2020-04-13/end-grand-strategy,The End of Grand Strategy,"Whatever else U.S. President Donald Trump has done in the field of international relations, he can claim one signal accomplishment: making grand strategy interesting again. For decades, American foreign policy elites in both parties embraced liberal internationalism, the idea that Washington should sustain and expand a global order that promoted open markets, open polities, and multilateral institutions. But Trump has repeatedly attacked the key pillars of liberal internationalism, from questioning the value of NATO to blowing up trade agreements to insulting allies. When, in July 2017, his national security team met with him in a windowless Pentagon meeting room known as “the Tank” to educate him about the virtues of the liberal international order, Trump blasted them as “a bunch of dopes and babies,” according to The Washington Post."
6,What Kim Wants,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/north-korea/2020-04-13/what-kim-wants,What Kim Wants,"Between 2017 and 2019, relations between the United States and North Korea made for great television. Perhaps this was by design: U.S. President Donald Trump seemed to believe that any interactions between the two adversaries would be more successful—or at least play more to his strengths—the more they resembled an entertaining spectacle in which he took center stage. For his part, the North Korean leader Kim Jong Un took advantage of Trump’s apparent desire for drama, which put Kim and his country at the center of world events. But a spectacle might have been inevitable, given the two leaders’ shared penchant for aggressiveness and unpredictability."
7,The Unlikely Environmentalists,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/world/2020-04-13/unlikely-environmentalists,The Unlikely Environmentalists,"There’s a reason climate change is often described as a “wicked problem.” Fully decarbonizing the economy will require not only completely transforming the global energy infrastructure, at a cost of many trillions of dollars, but also retrofitting all of the world’s buildings, remaking the planet’s agricultural practices, and revolutionizing transportation systems. It is difficult to see how this can be accomplished without some kind of global carbon tax or regulatory regime. But putting such a system in place is proving to be enormously difficult. The 2015 Paris agreement on climate change was a good first step, but many countries show little sign of meeting the commitments they made as part of that agreement, and the United States’ withdrawal from the process has presented a significant barrier to further progress. Given the slowing global economy and the slide toward populism and nationalism in much of the world, the prospects for any kind of comprehensive global accord seem increasingly remote. So far, at least, the public sector is failing to confront the problem."
8,Making Cyberspace Safe for Democracy,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2020-04-13/making-cyberspace-safe-democracy,Making Cyberspace Safe for Democracy,"With the 2020 U.S. presidential campaign underway, stories of Russian interference are again in the headlines. In 2016, Russia’s hacking operations and use of social media to manipulate public discourse in the United States caught U.S. policymakers off-guard. Four years later, officials have not yet fully understood that those attacks reflected the changing landscape of geopolitical competition. Viewing Russia’s attempts at interference in 2016 in isolation misses the larger context: rival states compete in the twenty-first century as much over information as any other terrain."
9,The Climate Debt,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/world/2020-04-13/climate-debt,The Climate Debt,"Growing up in a pastoral community in northern Kenya gave me a certain clarity about the climate crisis, a clarity born not from abstract understandings but from visceral experience. In 2000, a drought killed much of my father’s cattle herd and destroyed our neighbors’ livelihoods. I helped distribute parcels of food to starving people knowing that the supplies might keep them alive only until the next inevitable dry spell. In northern Kenya, droughts used to occur once every ten years. But in the last few decades, their frequency and severity have increased thanks to climate change. Droughts now occur once every two to three years, and they will likely become even more frequent, threatening nomadic pastoralism as a viable way of life."
10,From Pews to Politics: Religious Sermons and Political Participation in Africa,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2020-04-14/pews-politics-religious-sermons-and-political-participation,From Pews to Politics: Religious Sermons and Political Participation in Africa,"Every week, hundreds of millions of Africans listen to religious sermons about how best to live their lives. In this powerfully argued and creative book, McClendon and Riedl unpack how Christian sermons shape political life in contemporary Africa. Drawing on an impressive toolkit of modern social science methods—including surveys, randomized experiments, case studies, and the close reading of sermons themselves—the authors argue that religious messages shape their audiences’ political activity even when those messages are not explicitly political. Even if mainly about personal or family topics, sermons give parishioners analytic frameworks for understanding events in the world and how change is possible. Mainline Protestant and Catholic churches focus more on institutions and structural conditions; Pentecostals concentrate instead on individual causes and solutions. These different worldviews carry over into how their parishioners seek political change. The book is a must-read for those interested in contemporary Africa, the role of religion in politics, or the ongoing rise of evangelical and Pentecostal Christianity across the developing world."
11,Whose Agency: The Politics and Practice of Kenya’s HIV-Prevention NGOs,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2020-04-14/whose-agency-politics-and-practice-kenyas-hiv-prevention-ngos,Whose Agency: The Politics and Practice of Kenya’s HIV-Prevention NGOs,"The proliferation of nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) in the last three decades has constituted one of the signal changes in the landscape of development policy in Africa. Countries such as Kenya, which saw just a handful of foreign or religious groups in the 1980s, now host several thousand NGOs, including a growing number of local organizations. Often dependent on foreign aid, not always boasting the highest ethical standards, and prone to instability, these NGOs have drawn criticism for the way they affect policymaking in African countries, specifically how they sometimes erode the capacity and legitimacy of the state. This detailed ethnographic study of the grassroots activities of four Kenyan NGOs involved in HIV prevention argues persuasively that even the smallest and least well-funded organizations can have a significant and positive policy impact. Hershey finds that these small NGOs have proved surprisingly resilient and able to adapt to the vagaries of donor funding by shifting objectives and tactics."
12,Give and Take: Developmental Foreign Aid and the Pharmaceutical Industry in East Africa,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2020-04-14/give-and-take-developmental-foreign-aid-and-pharmaceutical,Give and Take: Developmental Foreign Aid and the Pharmaceutical Industry in East Africa,"Chorev examines the role that foreign aid played in helping build the pharmaceutical industry in Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda over the course of the last three decades. She argues convincingly that aid helped generate a market for local companies, mostly thanks to the demand for HIV drugs. Foreign donors then offered technical assistance and suggested quality-control measures. Chorev conducted thorough research on the ground in East Africa and in the headquarters of international agencies such as the World Health Organization and presents a perceptive analysis of what it takes to devise a productive industrial policy in the region. Less successful is the author’s claim that these case studies can provide a general template for the overall reform of foreign aid. Chorev is a fan of state-led industrial policy and argues that aid would be more effective if it directly promoted local production efforts. Unfortunately, the record of donors attempting this approach is extremely uneven. Many areas of economic development and poverty alleviation, including the provision of public goods, rarely lend themselves to the sort of public-private partnerships she encourages."
13,Land of Tears: The Exploration and Exploitation of Equatorial Africa,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2020-04-14/land-tears-exploration-and-exploitation-equatorial-africa,Land of Tears: The Exploration and Exploitation of Equatorial Africa,"Many writers have documented the abuses of the Belgian king Leopold II, who ruled the Congo Free State as a private fiefdom around the turn of the twentieth century. In search of ivory and rubber, Leopold’s agents committed unspeakable atrocities and violence that persisted even after Belgium nationalized the Congo Free State in 1908 to make it a more conventional colony. Harms’s deeply rewarding account of this history breaks new ground by broadening the context of Leopold’s depredations. His book places Leopold’s excesses alongside two other deeply exploitative state-building ventures in central Africa: France’s pillaging of its own neighboring Congo colony and the handiwork of the slave and ivory trader Tippu Tib, who operated on behalf of the sultan of Zanzibar and carved out an Arab zone of influence in the eastern half of the vast Congo River basin. Harms’s focus on economic and material factors reveals how the global demand for ivory and rubber shaped all three ventures."
14,Understanding South Africa,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2020-04-14/understanding-south-africa,Understanding South Africa,"This breezy introduction to contemporary South Africa by two of its veteran journalists is perfect for anyone wanting a quick survey of the main issues currently facing the country. Chapters cover the reasons for South Africa’s disappointing economic performance over the last three decades, the lamentable state of the educational system, the failure of the opposition to wrest power from the African National Congress, the divisive politics around land, and other contentious subjects. In each case, Du Plessis and Plaut smartly start with the historical context before tracing continuities with and departures from the apartheid years. The authors don’t present precise prescriptions for a way out of the stagnation in which the country finds itself. Nonetheless, one of the book’s strengths is its nuanced recognition of the many interests and viewpoints that inform the country’s major political issues, a complexity that stems directly from South Africa’s divided past."
15,Nigeria’s Soldiers of Fortune: The Abacha and Obasanjo Years,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2020-04-14/nigerias-soldiers-fortune-abacha-and-obasanjo-years,Nigeria’s Soldiers of Fortune: The Abacha and Obasanjo Years,"Siollun, a Nigerian journalist and historian, is the premier expert on the role of the military in Nigeria since the country won independence, in 1960. This sharply written and well-informed book is the third in his series on military rule in the country and focuses on the period between the end of General Ibrahim Babangida’s presidency, in 1993, and the return to power of General Olusegun Obasanjo, in 1999, through relatively free and fair elections. Those six years saw the rise of a particularly toxic politics, in which senior military officers constantly maneuvered and conspired to maintain their power. Siollun ably steers the reader through the events surrounding the businessman Mashood Abiola’s election to the presidency in 1993, the military’s refusal to allow him to assume office, and his subsequent arrest and death in custody; General Sani Abacha’s paranoid and violent presidency, from 1993 to 1998; and the trial and execution of the activist Ken Saro-Wiwa in 1995. Siollun argues that by the end of the twentieth century, the military had ruled Nigeria so badly that citizens were finally convinced of the superiority of civilian rule. This kind of judgment is rare in a narrative that is studiously dispassionate and entirely focused on the personalities and networks that shaped elite politics during this period, to the detriment of assessing the consequences of military rule."
16,"The Scientist and the Spy: A True Story of China, the FBI, and Industrial Espionage",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2020-04-14/scientist-and-spy-true-story-china-fbi-and-industrial-espionage,"The Scientist and the Spy: A True Story of China, the FBI, and Industrial Espionage","The theft of intellectual property is not just about computer chips and pharmaceutical formulas: some of the most valuable targets are seeds. To feed a growing population with shrinking arable land, China needs hardy, high-yield seeds but cannot afford to spend the many years it takes to develop them. That’s why a police officer in Iowa in 2011 found a Chinese businessman named Robert Mo wandering around in a cornfield where he didn’t belong. The book offers a fly-on-the-wall procedural of the resulting case that involves spies, informants, FBI agents, customs officials, and bugged phones and cars. Along the way, Hvistendahl delves into seed breeding, the antitrust investigation of the agribusiness giant Monsanto, the differences between security espionage and intellectual property theft, and the problem of racial profiling in U.S. investigations in these areas. Although most ethnic Chinese scientists and businesspeople in the United States are not spies—and most who are spies are not amateur collectors such as Mo—in this case, the suspect was indeed guilty. But he was the only person convicted in a case that involved many bad actors, and while he sat in prison, the Chinese company ChemChina legally acquired a huge amount of seed technology by purchasing the Swiss agriculture firm Syngenta."
17,The Shenzhen Experiment: The Story of China’s Instant City,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2020-04-14/shenzhen-experiment-story-chinas-instant-city,The Shenzhen Experiment: The Story of China’s Instant City,"Shenzhen was a fishing village that turned into a megalopolis through the alchemy of China’s reforms of the last 40 years. But Du, an architect and urban planner, complicates the simple narrative of the city’s ascent. The city sprawls over an area more than twice as large as that of the five boroughs of New York City. It has swallowed up land originally occupied by more than 2,000 long-established rural villages, which had flourished for centuries through farming, fishing, oyster cultivation, and, more recently, simple food processing and small-scale manufacturing. Some 300 “urban villages” survive inside the modern city, their roughly built tenements filled with cheap apartments that house migrants from all over the country. The most expensive gated community backs onto the biggest slum, which the city has targeted for redevelopment, a plan that in turn has spawned a resistance movement of preservationists. Throughout China, breakneck urbanization has required the seizure of land from communities in rural areas. Du hopes that the Shenzhen experiment can teach the rest of China to adopt development policies that are both more socially sensitive and concerned with protecting historical sites."
18,Fateful Triangle: How China Shaped U.S.-India Relations During the Cold War,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2020-04-14/fateful-triangle-how-china-shaped-us-india-relations-during-cold,Fateful Triangle: How China Shaped U.S.-India Relations During the Cold War,"Madan argues that the main factor shaping U.S.-Indian relations during the Cold War—even more than relations with Pakistan and the Soviet Union, nuclear proliferation, or shared democratic values—was China. Both New Delhi and Washington were worried about the rise of China, but they seldom agreed on how to respond to it. In the early 1950s, New Delhi wanted to engage with Beijing, whereas Washington sought confrontation; in the 1970s, the United States engaged, whereas India grew more hostile. Even when the Indian and U.S. positions aligned—as they did on confronting China in the late 1950s and early 1960s—the two countries did not agree on how to do it. In Madan’s account, Chinese thinking about the triangular relationship appears only occasionally, through the eyes of Indian and U.S. policymakers who believed that Beijing was anxious about the threat of U.S.-Indian collusion. Since the end of the Cold War, the basic calculations of the three sides have not fundamentally changed, which makes this work a useful guide to the likely limits of future U.S.-Indian collaboration in dealing with China."
19,Demolishing Faith: The Destruction and Desecration of Uyghur Mosques and Shrines,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2020-04-14/demolishing-faith-destruction-and-desecration-uyghur-mosques-and,Demolishing Faith: The Destruction and Desecration of Uyghur Mosques and Shrines,"The Washington-based Uyghur Human Rights Project uses its networks among Uighurs in exile and in Xinjiang to produce informative reports on the human rights disaster unfolding in that region. (I served for nine years on the board of the National Endowment for Democracy, which supports the UHRP.) Demolishing Faith details a couple of dozen of what may be thousands of destroyed mosques, shrines, and Muslim cemeteries in the region, using satellite photos and interviews of Uighurs who cared about these sites. Another report from 2019, Detained and Disappeared: Intellectuals Under Assault in the Uyghur Homeland, profiles seven of what were at the time 386 known cases of detained Uighur intellectuals. The organization maintains an updated list online and believes that the known cases are only a fraction of the total. The UHRP report Repression Across Borders: The CCP’s Illegal Harassment and Coercion of Uyghur Americans gives chilling examples of the way the Chinese government uses threatening phone calls and text messages—as well as arrests of relatives still in China—to put pressure on Uighur Americans to stay silent and to inform on others."
20,The Art of Political Control in China,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2020-04-14/art-political-control-china,The Art of Political Control in China,"Scholars increasingly find that state-society relations in modern China are too complex to be captured by concepts such as authoritarianism, totalitarianism, or, as some propose, partial democracy. Looking at the state’s relationship with rural society, Mattingly finds a dynamic system in which the state recruits low-level officials from within local kinship and religious networks. These officials try to serve both their superiors and their communities—and sometimes themselves. Mattingly’s sharply observed examples show how local officials help get villagers to give up land (usually for unfairly low compensation and often to be used by crony capitalists), comply with unpopular family-planning regulations, and stay silent in the face of corruption. But the system is delicately balanced. Where social networks are weak, local cadres are unable to exert control, and where those networks are strong, local leaders may try to protect their communities against the state. When that happens, the central government sends in the police."

He recounts in dispiriting detail the maneuvers by Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen first to delay the tribunal’s creation and then to undermine its effectiveness. Negotiations over the formation and operation of the tribunal did not even start until 1997—18 years after the defeat of the Khmer Rouge. Nine more years were spent negotiating the tribunal’s structure and getting it funded, set up, and staffed. The court then got bogged down in legal and procedural debates between the international and the Cambodian prosecutors and judges. The Cambodian side tried to prevent the court from going after anyone with influence in or connections to the Hun Sen government. To add to the mess, zealous defense lawyers recruited from overseas did their best to stymie the few active prosecutions. Despite ample funding from foreign donors, in 14 years of operation, the tribunal has convicted only three people and opened investigations into just four others."
22,The Caste of Merit: Engineering Education in India,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2020-04-14/caste-merit-engineering-education-india,The Caste of Merit: Engineering Education in India,"Throughout Indian history, castes have jostled with one another in the economic and political spheres, with those lower in the hierarchy seeking to raise their social standing and those above seeking to defend theirs. Subramanian observes how these contests play out in the context of the Indian Institutes of Technology, 23 schools around the country that have trained an engineering elite not only for Indian firms but also for many U.S. companies and universities. Admission is strictly exam-based, yet IIT students overwhelmingly come from high-caste backgrounds. In India—as in the United States and elsewhere—academic advancement rarely occurs without a foundation of family privilege. Focusing on the IIT in Madras, Subramanian shows how upper-caste Tamil graduates have converted their caste privilege into professional prestige and resisted attempts to increase the enrollment of lower-caste groups. The fetishization of exams has rendered caste invisible in the engineering profession but, she argues, lets it function behind the scenes. In India as elsewhere, the myth of meritocracy justifies the reproduction of long-standing social hierarchies."

Thompson traces how a coalition of liberals and religious leaders sought to create a democratic constitutional monarchy in what was known as Greater Syria (an area that comprised parts of present-day Israel, Lebanon, and Syria). They drew inspiration from Woodrow Wilson’s Fourteen Points and the growing clamor for self-determination around the world. But British and French leaders and bureaucrats, especially the French diplomat and imperialist Robert de Caix, conspired to squash this Arab bid for independence. Thompson imagines what would have happened had Syria gained independence in 1920 and suggests that the resulting state could have offered a model for the marriage of Islam and liberal democracy in the region. This counterfactual is both sweeping and unprovable. In reality, European powers strangled Syrian independence in its crib, and by the late 1930s, an intolerant form of Islam and autocratic Arab nationalism came to prevail in the Middle East."

In this provocative book, he explores how jihadis and other Islamists develop their projects. He draws from his fieldwork in Bosnia with Muslim Bosniaks and with foreign, mainly Arab fighters who came to the Balkans during the disintegration of Yugoslavia in the early 1990s and remained beyond 9/11. Li is a gifted writer and storyteller, and his research has amazing breadth. Jihadi universalism jostled with other belief systems in Bosnia, including those promulgated by international peacekeeping missions, the “war on terror,” and the Non-Aligned Movement (which was headquartered during the Cold War in Yugoslavia). But universalism is an awkward framework for understanding what drove holy warriors to Bosnia in the first place. Li’s analysis leaves unexamined the overwhelmingly Sunni composition of the foreign Arab fighters. He doesn’t delve into the particularities of Bosniak Islam or consider the role of the Ottoman Empire in shaping religious practices and belief in the region. Despite these omissions, Li should be commended for a finely crafted plunge into international jihad."

Under Barack Obama, the United States and other major powers negotiated the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action to contain Iran’s presumed nuclear ambitions. That deal, however, did little to curb the role of Iranian proxies in the wider region. Under Donald Trump—and especially following the appointments of John Bolton as national security adviser and Mike Pompeo as secretary of state—Washington shifted from containment to a more hostile posture, with the goal of regime change and the possibility of military confrontation very much on the table. The Trump administration has also promoted joint Israeli and Saudi regional hegemony to counter Tehran’s influence. Entessar and Afrasiabi do a fine job of parsing the technical aspects of the nuclear deal, as well as the recent efforts of China, Russia, and European powers to dilute the effects of new U.S. sanctions on Iran. Although the authors underline the limitations of Obama’s approach to Iran, they clearly prefer it to Trump’s more coercive policy. They suggest that Iran is too big and well rooted in the region to succumb to Trump’s campaign of “maximum pressure.”"

Ghattas describes how waves of extremism and bigotry flowed out from Iran and Saudi Arabia, reshaping a region that had been generally pluralistic and fundamentally tolerant. After 1979, “the dictatorship of the closed mind” took hold in many societies in the Middle East. Ghattas paints a big picture through a number of small portraits. Many of her protagonists tried to resist the rising tide of extremism, including the late Saudi Arabian journalist Jamal Khashoggi, whose killing at the hands of Saudi operatives Ghattas narrates in the conclusion of the book. She is unsparing in her critique of regional leadership through the decades, from Iran’s revolutionary leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in modern Saudi Arabia. Ghattas eschews despair and finds heroes among her own millennial generation, men and women who refuse to buckle under the inherited calamities of an earlier era."
27,The Arab Winter: A Tragedy,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2020-04-14/arab-winter-tragedy,The Arab Winter: A Tragedy,"Feldman, a legal scholar, analyzes the events of the 2010–11 Arab Spring and its aftermath at a high level of abstraction. In his view, the revolts represented the first time Arabs rose up against their leaders, replacing the unity of Arab states with the unity of Arab peoples. But it’s not entirely clear whom he’s referring to when he writes about “the Arab people.” In one brief aside, Feldman describes “the people” as the intelligentsia and “the ordinary middle class” who led the protests in Tunisia, Egypt, and elsewhere. But many other groups were involved in the movements that toppled governments in 2011. Feldman misconstrues the dynamics of the social contract in Arab autocracies, claims that the Syrian uprising was inherently violent even though it was initially peaceful, and insists that the Egyptian people invited the armed forces to topple the democratically elected government of the Muslim Brotherhood in June 2013. But the book is still worthwhile because Feldman challenges readers to rethink what happened in 2011."

During that earlier time period, Taroutina points out, Russian artists had moved away from imitating contemporary European styles and toward developing a local “Russo-Byzantine” tradition that drew from older sources. This shift, although seemingly conservative in nature, in fact produced innovative art. The new fascination with Byzantine roots generated an interest in cleaning the dust off old icons that suddenly struck Russian viewers as looking rather modern. These pictures likely served as a source of inspiration for many modernist artists. Mikhail Vrubel began his artistic career working in the Byzantine manner. Wassily Kandinsky in his youth copied Byzantine miniatures, his artistic theory informed by his church attendance; according to Taroutina, even his mature paintings bear some resemblance to old Russian icons. Kazimir Malevich’s “quasi-cubism,” Taroutina writes, also owes more to the Russo-Byzantine tradition than to contemporary European cubism."
29,Nikita Khrushchev’s Journey Into America,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2020-04-14/nikita-khrushchevs-journey-america,Nikita Khrushchev’s Journey Into America,"In 1959, U.S. President Dwight Eisenhower controversially welcomed the Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev for a jaunt around the United States—just three years earlier, the Soviet government had brutally crushed a revolution in Hungary. Khrushchev’s improbable two-week visit did not change the course of the Cold War, nor do Nelson and Schoenbachler change the general understanding of the U.S.-Soviet rivalry. Instead, the book presents a colorful chronicle of Khrushchev’s tour and a lively portrait of the Soviet leader. A firm Marxist, Khrushchev never missed an opportunity to remind his hosts, whether on Wall Street or in Hollywood, that communism was on the right side of history and that capitalism was doomed. He bragged incessantly about Soviet triumphs in space and reacted rudely, sometimes exploding in anger, whenever he detected condescension or disrespect. When not provoked, he could be open and genial, charming and funny, and always anxious to connect with “ordinary Americans.” Unwilling to admit the United States’ economic or technological superiority, he showed curiosity and admiration for things that were new to him, from Eisenhower’s helicopter (he ordered several for his own use in the Soviet Union) to self-service at the IBM cafeteria (he began to introduce this technology in the Soviet Union on his return)."
30,Three Books about the Chernobyl Nuclear Disaster,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2020-04-14/three-books-about-chernobyl-nuclear-disaster,Three Books about the Chernobyl Nuclear Disaster,"Three recent books examine the origins and fallout of the Chernobyl nuclear reactor explosion in 1986. At the center of both Higginbotham’s and Plokhy’s books are minute-by-minute reconstructions of the world’s worst nuclear accident and its immediate aftermath. The more detailed their accounts become, the more the two histories overlap. The two narratives feature many of the same protagonists: scientists, managers, engineers, firefighters, doctors, Communist Party functionaries, and government officials. They even use some of the same quotes. Both works begin with the preparation for the fatal test of Chernobyl’s Unit 4 reactor, which led to the explosion. In both books, one encounters the initial obliviousness of local residents, with children playing outdoors, men fishing, and sunbathers marveling at how easy it was to get a tan that day, all while the radiation readings on the (very scarce) dosimeters were off the scale and terror-stricken nuclear experts feared the possibility of a true Armageddon of radioactive contamination reaching the Dnieper River and the oceans of the world. Both Higginbotham and Plokhy show how the communist leadership mobilized hundreds of thousands of “expendable” people to clear the damage caused by the catastrophe. They explain how the Soviet Union’s enormous appetite for nuclear energy encouraged thrift over safety; the state ignored warnings about flaws in the reactor design and covered up information about preceding accidents."
31,Trials and Tribulations,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/world/2020-04-13/trials-and-tribulations,Trials and Tribulations,"In “How Poverty Ends” (January/February 2020), Abhijit Banerjee and Esther Duflo, two of last year’s three Nobel laureates in economics, contend that “the true ingredients of persistent economic growth”—development of the sort that pulls people out of poverty and raises living standards across the board—“remain mysterious.” They understand poverty as a big puzzle to be solved mainly through experiments, notably randomized controlled trials. I have admired and supported Banerjee and Duflo from the early days of their economics training. But I believe theirs is not the right way to understand the challenge of ending poverty. There are not huge mysteries about what is needed to end extreme poverty. Practical solutions are largely known and within reach; what poor countries need is not more economists performing randomized trials to confirm what experts already know but good governance and development assistance to cover financing gaps."
32,A Foreign Policy for the Climate,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2020-04-13/foreign-policy-climate,A Foreign Policy for the Climate,"In September 2019, after a two-year drought and some of the hottest days on record, wildfires broke out across eastern Australia. The fires raged for seven months and consumed 75,000 square miles. They displaced tens of thousands of people and destroyed almost 3,000 homes. In Melbourne, the air quality was 30 percent worse than in famously toxic New Delhi. Researchers estimate that more than one billion animals died in the conflagration. And the total economic damage is expected to exceed the previous $4.4 billion record set by the Black Saturday fires in 2009."
33,The Strategic Case for U.S. Climate Leadership,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2020-04-13/strategic-case-us-climate-leadership,The Strategic Case for U.S. Climate Leadership,"In the United States, the case for greater action on climate change is typically made on environmental grounds. But there are equally compelling economic, geopolitical, and national security rationales for the United States to lead the world on climate policy. Even those who remain skeptical of the environmental urgency of the problem should recognize the overwhelming strategic advantages of U.S. climate action at home and abroad."
34,China’s Coming Upheaval,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2020-04-03/chinas-coming-upheaval,China’s Coming Upheaval,"Over the past few years, the United States’ approach to China has taken a hard-line turn, with the balance between cooperation and competition in the U.S.-Chinese relationship tilting sharply toward the latter. Most American policymakers and commentators consider this confrontational new strategy a response to China’s growing assertiveness, embodied especially in the controversial figure of Chinese President Xi Jinping. But ultimately, this ongoing tension—particularly with the added pressures of the new coronavirus outbreak and an economic downturn—is likely to expose the brittleness and insecurity that lie beneath the surface of Xi’s, and Beijing’s, assertions of solidity and strength."
35,The Comeback Nation,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2020-03-31/comeback-nation,The Comeback Nation,"As the 2020s dawn, it is hard to find any member of the U.S. foreign policy establishment who does not believe that the United States is in decline and that the waning of its influence has accelerated under a president who seems to revel in attacking U.S. allies and enemies alike. The debate is not over the fact of American decline but over how the United States should manage its diminishing status."

37,Electrified Islands: The Road to E-Mobility in the Caribbean,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2020-04-14/electrified-islands-road-e-mobility-caribbean,Electrified Islands: The Road to E-Mobility in the Caribbean,"Finally, a good news story for the long-suffering islands of the Caribbean. The relatively small size of these islands makes them practical places to convert vehicles to run on batteries and to generate power for those vehicles from potentially abundant renewables such as energy from wind, the sun, and biomass. For too long, dependence on imported oil has contributed to crippling external debt levels, price inflation, and weak currencies in the region. Pairing electric vehicle deployment with an expansion of renewable energy could make Caribbean nations less vulnerable to the fluctuating price of oil, reduce transport and electricity costs, and drastically cut greenhouse gas emissions. Electric vehicles could also bolster resilience by storing energy that might otherwise be cut off during natural disasters. The authors of this snappy policy brief produce case studies of Barbados, Bermuda, the Cayman Islands, the Dominican Republic, and Jamaica, arguing that these islands’ relatively small fleets of vehicles could be quickly electrified and that charging networks will not need to be as extensive in Caribbean nations as they would have to be in larger countries. The authors urge governments in the Caribbean to transform nature’s potential into national progress."
38,Two Books on Displaced Populations,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2020-04-14/two-books-displaced-populations,Two Books on Displaced Populations,"As global migration flows surge, there is renewed interest in the histories of previously displaced populations. When the Nazis tightened their grip on Europe, and the United Kingdom and the United States slammed shut their doors, desperate refugees turned to less common destinations, including the British and French colonies of the Caribbean. Two highly competent studies recount the harrowing journeys of those European refugees lucky enough to secure safe havens in distant tropical destinations."

The sweeping journey of the book stretches from the arrival of Columbus to the election of U.S. President Donald Trump, and it intends to reinsert the Hispanic past into the memories and imaginations of contemporary Americans. The tragedies and injustices are countless. Gibson unearths the deep roots of white supremacy, which was critical to justifying the demolition of indigenous communities, the enslavement of Africans, the conquest of Mexico, the land grabs from the Spanish in California, and a succession of U.S. military interventions in the Caribbean. But Gibson avoids dogma, celebrating the enduring contributions of Hispanic peoples to American life in her visits to Los Angeles, Miami, New York, Tucson, and her hometown of Dalton, Georgia. “In a shared Anglo-Hispanic popular culture, who or what is ‘Hispanic’ remains unresolved,” she observes. The story she tells “is not a separate history of outsiders or interlopers, but one that is central to how the United States has developed and will continue to develop.”"
40,U.S. Hegemony and the Americas: Power and Economic Statecraft in International Relations,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2020-04-14/us-hegemony-and-americas-power-and-economic-statecraft,U.S. Hegemony and the Americas: Power and Economic Statecraft in International Relations,"Santa-Cruz argues that since the 1970s, the United States has successfully preserved its core interests in Latin America through “thick” economic statecraft, a sophisticated approach that embeds liberal values, mutual gains, and strategic restraint in commercial diplomacy. With some regrettable exceptions—including supporting the brutal overthrow of a progressive government in Chile in 1973 and fruitlessly twisting arms to corral support for the 2003 invasion of Iraq—the United States has eschewed heavy-handed unilateralism in the Americas. In separate chapters on Canada, Mexico, and Central and South America, Santa-Cruz pushes back against the notion that U.S. influence has steadily declined in the Western Hemisphere but declines to pin down the indicators or key measurements of Washington’s sway. Santa-Cruz denounces U.S. President Donald Trump’s raw exercise of coercive power as counterproductive and badly, perhaps irreparably, damaging to the United States’ reputation and legitimacy. Integrating international relations theory and detailed histories, this book is an ambitious, landmark contribution against which future studies of inter-American relations will be judged."
41,Is Europe Christian?,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2020-04-14/europe-christian,Is Europe Christian?,"This book, widely discussed when it first appeared in French, critiques the notion that Europe is fundamentally Christian, an idea in vogue in far-right populist rhetoric. The author is a specialist in Islamic culture but also—tellingly, given the book’s short length, thin documentation, and occasional factual lapses—a celebrated French public intellectual. He grabbed headlines in the past for arguing, convincingly, that Islamist terrorism has little to do with Islam. Here, he effortlessly skewers the pieties surrounding the idea of a Christian Europe, insisting that the continent today is extremely secular and multicultural and that most right-wing nationalists ignore or reject Christian teachings on sex, abortion, and the role of women. Why have calls for a Christian Europe gained such traction? His provocative answer is that since the 1960s, a “totalitarian” left has foisted on European countries a political correctness comprised of libertarianism, hedonism, and the marginalization of the church. Right-wing populists appeal to Christianity to rebel against this discourse. But since they are not actually religious, they wind up simply reinforcing the “dechristianization” of Europe by draining meaning from the symbols of Christianity. Unfortunately, the book ends with just a single paragraph on how to rebalance secular and religious values."

The church, which viewed democracy with suspicion, began its international activities in 1917 with systematic opposition to Wilsonian liberalism and Soviet communism. In the interwar period, it signed “concordats” with any government—including fascist ones in Germany, Italy, and Spain, and also the newly independent Baltic states—that promised to deepen Catholic influence in family law (opposing divorce and, later, abortion), education (creating space for religious teaching), and civil society (where religious symbols would remain part of civic life) and to provide state support for the church. Famously, the church remained silent on the persecution and extermination of the Jews during World War II. After the war, the church became a consistent bulwark against communism. This became particularly important after the war, when the church reconciled with democrats and promoted Christian democratic parties in Europe in order to bolster resistance to the influence of the Soviet Union. The church took a more conciliatory stance on decolonization, rightly sensing that the developing world might be fertile ground for future expansion."
43,Island Stories: An Unconventional History of Britain,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2020-04-14/island-stories-unconventional-history-britain,Island Stories: An Unconventional History of Britain,"One of the more amusing aspects of Brexit has been the tendency of Conservative Party leaders in the United Kingdom to analogize leaving the EU to heroic past triumphs, comparing Brexit to the waging of World War II, for instance, or to the famous British victories at Agincourt in 1415 and Waterloo in 1815. Many non-Britons (and many Britons, as well) find such comparisons risible. Reynolds, a historian, seeks to explain why some of his compatriots view the United Kingdom in this grandiose way. Although he has written a number of weighty books on twentieth-century history, this volume—lively, slender, and timely—is more reminiscent of his historical documentaries for BBC television. His pithy summaries of British experiences of and beliefs about empire and decline demonstrate why the fanciful Brexit analogies are misguided. The reader is left to wonder, however, why these narratives remain persuasive to Britons in a way that has no parallel in the rest of Europe."

But critics often charge that Europeans do not do enough to raise standards of governance elsewhere—particularly in their own neighborhood. In this wide-ranging book, a political scientist argues that European efforts to use nonmilitary means to promote the rule of law and good governance outside the EU—in particular, to quash corruption—have not been hugely successful. She cites examples from a dozen countries from Egypt to Moldova. Yet one wonders if such criticism, backed by calls for a more “comprehensive” anticorruption policy, hold the EU to an unrealistic standard. After all, few efforts to promote democracy and good government are successful. It seems incontrovertible that EU investment, trade, and diplomatic support made all the difference in at least three recent cases. Without such aid, Ukraine would almost certainly have collapsed, Kosovo would be dysfunctional, and Tunisia would have made less progress than it has. Perhaps Europeans should be more modest, as many development analysts counsel, and learn to accept “good enough” governance"
45,"Two Blankets, Three Sheets",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2020-04-14/two-blankets-three-sheets,"Two Blankets, Three Sheets","The author of this best-selling novel, translated from the Dutch, emigrated in 1998 from Iraq to the Netherlands to avoid military service. He then spent nine years in a Dutch government-run housing center as an undocumented asylum seeker. He was denied citizenship but taught himself Dutch and published a book in 2009 that was awarded the EU Prize for Literature. His newest novel is an account, by turns comic and heart-rending, of an applicant’s interaction with the asylum apparatus in the Netherlands. The asylum seeker arrives a trusting person, assuming that acceptance is just around the corner. Officials welcome him with two blankets and three sheets and tell him that he must constantly report those items’ location—a first hint that he is actually stuck in a Kafkaesque world of seemingly arbitrary legalistic procedures, in which truth is subject to bureaucratic whimsy. Day to day, he is treated much like a Victorian schoolboy, subject to petty humiliations and punishments. Some asylum seekers in Europe wait for decades for legal status, enduring a series of determinations designed to make asylum more difficult to obtain. No other book I have read makes the soul-destroying effects of European asylum procedures more vividly clear than this one."

Smith denies that German nationalism is, as some historians argue, a single doctrine, let alone an intrinsically aggressive one. To support this thesis, Smith provides a sweeping history beginning in 1500, when Germany was an amalgam of regions, cities, and principalities. For most of the next four centuries, as Germany’s sense of cultural coherence grew, it remained a relatively peaceful region with a benign sense of national identity that neither excluded domestic minorities nor threatened external neighbors. Even in the nineteenth century, as a nationalist project to unite Germany took hold, the country remained relatively peaceful, with a few brief, if notable, exceptions, such as the Franco-Prussian War. And for the last 75 years, Germans have developed what Smith describes as a “compassionate, empathetic realism about belonging.” The “nationalist age,” from 1914 to 1945, when the politics of identity turned horribly violent, is thus an exception. Smith describes its excesses—from the slaughter on the eastern front to the Holocaust—in moving detail, but he seems, like many historians before him, somewhat baffled by their ultimate cause."

Wilson, a former Republican political consultant, has the zeal of a convert. Some of his advice is elementary: for example, only 15 swing states will matter in the general election. Other admonitions are more compelling. With Donald Trump as the incumbent, the election will be a referendum on his presidency. But because Trump practices “pure, unadulterated opportunistic politics,” Democrats will have to beat him at his own game. They should refuse to feed Trump issues that he can use against them (including socialism, reparations for slavery, and the Green New Deal). Instead, Democrats should engage in “shallow, content-free campaigning,” concentrating on a unifying message of common purpose and traditional values. Trump will stop at nothing to avoid a loss, so Democrats must be prepared to respond to the worst attacks they can imagine. A brisk read, the book delivers sobering insights that must be heeded before the Democrats choose their nominee."

Now, writes Kimmage, “it is a wavering West that is on trial.” Defending the West—which he defines as a geopolitical and cultural concept rather than a geographic place—has been the animating core of U.S. foreign policy since the beginning of the twentieth century. Kimmage traces the rise of the concept in the first half of the century and then its gradual decline under criticism from both the left (which saw the paradigm as too white and too imperial) and the right (which saw it as too multinational), through to its evaporation after the end of the Cold War. Presidents once routinely touted the West in their speeches, and universities required introductory courses in Western civilization. No more. Kimmage outlines the costs of this loss: the idea had provided a reason for international engagement, a compass for dealing with authoritarian challenges from states such as China and Russia, and a broader guiding principle for U.S. foreign policy."
49,The Power Worshippers: Inside the Dangerous Rise of Religious Nationalism,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2020-04-14/power-worshippers-inside-dangerous-rise-religious-nationalism,The Power Worshippers: Inside the Dangerous Rise of Religious Nationalism,"Based on more than a decade of investigative reporting, Stewart conducts a chilling exploration of an American political movement that she dubs “Christian nationalism” because of its claim of returning to the founders’ core belief—a false claim, of course—that the United States was a Christian nation. The movement began in the late 1970s, latching on to abortion as a useful hot-button issue. But contrary to its conventional portrayal as a social or cultural phenomenon, Stewart insists that the movement is an ambitious political effort to take over every element of government with the aim of elevating the Bible (in cherry-picked form) over the Constitution as the chief source of governmental legitimacy. Christian nationalism represents a radical rejection of the founders’ core belief in the separation of church and state. Made up of a coalition of pastoral, advocacy, and activist groups, the movement also has international ambitions. Its adherents are particularly fond of autocrats, such as Russian President Vladimir Putin, who are able to fuse church and state. Much of what Stewart recounts would seem incredible were it not presented through extensive quotations from speeches by, documents of, and conversations with movement leaders."

Krasner argues that because prosperous, democratic nations are exceptions in international politics, the United States would protect itself better and make the world safer if it adopted policies “acceptable to despotic rulers,” coming to terms with the “good-enough governance” of nondemocratic governments instead of trying to consolidate democracy around the world. His detailed list of what counts as good enough leaves no doubt that he is calling for a dramatic departure from current policy. Good-enough governments are those that are able to maintain order and a moderate level of economic growth and uphold rule by law (if not necessarily the rule of law). Washington would accept that elections in many countries are a sham and that it is hard to protect human rights from abroad. Because weak states can cause such great harm to others (from terrorism, pandemics, proliferation, refugee flows, and other transnational threats), their capacity to govern is more important than the finer points of democracy. Good enough, it seems, is a very low bar. Krasner’s call for greater humility in U.S. foreign policy is welcome, but many will find it hard to discern how such a policy is compatible with American values."
51,Stealth: The Secret Contest to Invent Invisible Aircraft,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2020-04-14/stealth-secret-contest-invent-invisible-aircraft,Stealth: The Secret Contest to Invent Invisible Aircraft,"In 1974, the Pentagon held a competition to see if aerospace companies could develop an aircraft that could not be detected by radar. Creating stealth aircraft required reducing the likelihood that a plane would be detected by radar by a factor of 10,000. Two companies competed successfully, and each ended up with a major stealth program. Lockheed got the F-117 fighter, and Northrop, the B-2 bomber. Westwick does a good job of explaining the engineering principles at work, the competitive instinct of the engineers—which motivated them more than did a patriotic desire to gain the upper hand over the Soviet Union—and the advantages of a close partnership between the private sector and the state. This narrative presents a positive story of technological advance and the people who made it possible, although Westwick does raise questions about the expense of the programs, given that so few B-2 bombers were built, such as, “What targets were worth risking $2 billion to hit?”"

With word of a faux anti-Bolshevik conspiracy within Russia, the Soviets forged links with real anti-Bolsheviks abroad, persuading them that encouraging developments in Russia would dampen the need for outside intervention. Although the United States was not above using such “active measures” during the Cold War, the Soviet Union and its satellite states, such as Czechoslovakia and East Germany, were more accomplished in their design of them: they planted stories to convince the United States’ European allies of the threat posed by Washington’s imperialist warmongering and reckless preparations for nuclear war. By the time the Cold War ended, such measures had become almost routine. Moscow has revived them in recent years as Russian relations with the West have become more hostile, with the added impetus and reach of social media. Rid concludes this fascinating and well-researched history by warning of the need to take the challenge of misinformation seriously while being careful to not exaggerate its effects."

But it may well now stand as one of the best-established contentions in the field, supported not only by Lyall’s carefully constructed statistical analysis but also by his series of fascinating case studies that cover a range of encounters, some long forgotten, to show how the proposition works in practice. For instance, Lyall dips into the nineteenth-century wars between Russia and Kokand (now part of Uzbekistan) and between Spain and Morocco to demonstrate that schisms within Kokand’s and Morocco’s armies led to their defeat. Lyall’s book represents a welcome mingling of the traditions of quantitative and qualitative political science. He sets a rigorous and imaginative methodological standard that others will struggle to match, in the process raising questions, perhaps unintentionally, about the value of prior quantitative research that has drawn from inferior databases."

These moments of collaboration between foes have included upholding standards of fairness in combat; establishing protections for noncombat-ants and prisoners, as required by the Geneva Conventions; and working together to bring fighting to an end. Such actions relate to the broader moral complexity of combat: for example, doctors at a field hospital may try but fail to save one of their own and then successfully treat the enemy solider responsible for their colleague’s death. And even as the killing proceeds—and despite rhetorical claims that victory depends on uncompromising ruthlessness—enemies can still set boundaries that preserve mutual respect and a shared sense of humanity. When unsure of a war’s purpose and strategic ration-ale, those on the frontlines make their own accommodations. In the trenches of World War I, soldiers often saw their own overzealous superior officers as more of a menace than the enemy."

In this timely and thoughtful book, Kaurin doesn’t address Trump directly but provides an invaluable guide for situations in which demands for obedience conflict with the imperatives of conscience. How should military personnel and ordinary citizens respond to troubling orders or manage the competing claims of loyalty to the group and belonging in a broader society? Through chapters considering the virtue of obedience, discipline and loyalty, and the use of judgment and discretion, she argues that individuals faced with demands to obey should adopt a “critical” stance that keeps the wider context in view while allowing them to act in morally and practically sustainable ways. She concludes by testing her approach in a number of hypothetical scenarios, including receiving orders to launch a nuclear strike, dealing with a toxic company commander, and coping with the tensions between a mission’s goals and a senior commander’s orders."

This detailed work by a London-based lawyer studies the growth of illegal financial activities across borders, including the money laundering of drug dealers, human traffickers, and terrorist financers. Governments, separately and in cooperation, have tried to clamp down on these cross-border financial transfers in (sometimes reluctant) private partnership with the major global banks. In other cases, governments—acting both unilaterally and multilaterally—have imposed sanctions on foreign individuals, organizations, and even other governments. The United States, for instance, maintained financial sanctions on entities in 12 countries and territories at the time of this writing. Navias parses the thicket of laws and regulations in the United States, the United Kingdom, and the European Union that regulate financial transactions, showing the tensions and even conflicts between these legal regimes. This is a necessary handbook for anyone doing international business who wants to stay within the law."

This fine and informative book explores one effort to find a remedy for vitamin deficiency. With private financing from the United States, European scientists began three decades ago to try to breed a strain of genetically modified rice that contains beta carotene, a precursor to vitamin A. By 2002, they had succeeded, creating a variety known as “golden rice” thanks to its color. But nearly 20 years later, only Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United States—whose populations already have adequate levels of vitamin A in their diets—have allowed the release of this rice. Many official obstacles sit in the way of the spread of golden rice, with even approval for field trials difficult to secure. Regis shows that although nongovernmental organizations and activist groups such as Greenpeace have generated much emotional opposition to genetically modified organisms, it is government regulations and the glacial pace of plant breeding that have delayed the introduction of golden rice to the parts of the world where it would be most beneficial."

Heydon, a former Australian trade official, provides a useful description and analysis of the predicament of the WTO, delving into how countries have had to negotiate trade agreements outside the multilateral framework of the organization. Heydon analyzes 21 case studies drawn from many countries that explain how the world trade system has worked (or failed). The book serves as a well-written introduction to the world trading system as it actually exists today and is also a good reference for readers who want to pursue more granular topics, such as trade in intellectual property or national support for agriculture."

Much of the book charts the evolution of agriculture—after all, most human beings in recent millennia have been farmers—tracing the development of new and better edible plants, as well as pivotal inventions such as the stirrup, the iron plow, and the horse collar. With the emergence of energy from fossil fuels such as coal and oil, the industrializing West greatly improved production and raised standards of living (albeit at the cost of tremendous pollution). The rest of the world eventually followed suit. As a result, the human population exploded in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, because of better nutrition and health care. But Malthusian predictions of overpopulation have not been borne out: fertility rates gradually declined in many parts of the world even as living standards improved. Coggan also pays due attention to the historical importance of economies outside the West—China, India, and Islamic empires—and their many contributions to Europe after the fall of the Roman Empire."
60,Paying for Pollution: Why a Carbon Tax Is Good for America,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2020-04-14/paying-pollution-why-carbon-tax-good-america,Paying for Pollution: Why a Carbon Tax Is Good for America,"If governments hope to slow global warming and rising sea levels, they must reduce the emission of greenhouse gases, especially carbon dioxide. Metcalf, an economist and former U.S. Treasury official, argues that the best way to do that is to levy a tax on carbon emissions. Such a tax would be far superior, in his view, to both strenuous new regulations on carbon emissions (although some additional regulations will be needed) and cap and trade, a program in which companies are given emission allowances and permitted to sell what they do not use to companies that exceed their limits. Any new tax produces distributional concerns. Metcalf would prefer to return the substantial revenues generated by a carbon tax to the tax-paying public, perhaps by reducing other taxes. The book doubles as a primer on public taxation. Metcalf draws the majority of his examples from the United States, but his argument applies to most other countries, as well."
61,Culture and Order in World Politics,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2020-04-14/culture-and-order-world-politics,Culture and Order in World Politics,"This persuasive collection of essays makes the case that constructing order in international relations is in large part a matter of managing cultural diversity. In recent centuries, building international or regional orders over sets of fluid, shifting cultures has entailed establishing various regimes, from imperial realms (such as the Chinese and Ottoman empires) to the more familiar liberal hegemony of the United States after World War II. Problems arise when these overarching orders favor some cultural identities over others, which can generate new cultural movements that aim to overthrow the order, from Uighur resistance to Han Chinese hegemony in Xinjiang to populist reactions to liberal internationalism in Western countries. The authors generally agree that a legitimate international order must tolerate cultural diversity, but they disagree over the extent to which the current international order—based on Western liberal norms—actually does so. This stimulating volume reveals an important tension in world politics today: even as the institutions that uphold the current one express respect for cultural difference, fractious cultural forces—including within the West—threaten to topple it."
62,Toward a Theory of Peace: The Role of Moral Beliefs,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2020-04-14/toward-theory-peace-role-moral-beliefs,Toward a Theory of Peace: The Role of Moral Beliefs,"Forsberg, an antinuclear activist and defense policy expert who died in 2007, is most famous as a leader of the “nuclear freeze” campaign of the 1980s. As revealed by this remarkable book, the text of which comes from her 1997 doctoral dissertation, Forsberg was also a thoughtful theorist of peace studies and political change. War in world history, Forsberg claims, can be seen as “socially sanctioned large scale group violence,” a class of human behavior akin to human sacrifice, cannibalism, slavery, and lethal punishment. She observes that most people are revolted by these forms of violence, and so she delves deeply into psychology, anthropology, and history to see how and under what conditions societies reach moral judgments about certain kinds of violence. She believed that popular movements could transform people’s moral beliefs about war and weapons. Her thesis is a dazzling intellectual tour de force with a sobering conclusion: moral revolutions take many lifetimes to unfold, requiring centuries of dedication and struggle."
63,"Reluctant Warriors: Germany, Japan, and Their U.S. Alliance Dilemma",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2020-04-14/reluctant-warriors-germany-japan-and-their-us-alliance-dilemma,"Reluctant Warriors: Germany, Japan, and Their U.S. Alliance Dilemma","Germany and Japan have benefited from the U.S.-led postwar order, rising to the top of the developed world as what the authors of this book call “civilian great powers” within the U.S.-led alliance system. The United States, too, has been lucky to have Germany and Japan as stable and cooperative partners, anchoring its global leadership position in Europe and Asia. Since the end of the Cold War, both countries have moved closer to involvement in U.S. military interventions despite their postwar antimilitaristic legal and cultural norms. But as the authors cogently detail, these mutually beneficial ties have long been laced with frustrations. As early as the 1970s, Washington began criticizing Germany and Japan for free-riding and urging them to expand their defense spending and international military roles. The Trump administration now reiterates these demands, in blunter terms. The authors argue that Germany and Japan will continue to manage these tensions, inching just enough toward meeting U.S. demands to maintain ties. But that delicate balancing act will fall apart if the United States acts erratically and disrupts relations."
64,The Return of Great Power Rivalry,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2020-04-14/return-great-power-rivalry,The Return of Great Power Rivalry,"Alexis de Tocqueville famously argued that democracies were “decidedly inferior” to autocratic states in the conduct of foreign affairs. Other thinkers, including Herodotus, Machiavelli, Montesquieu, and some modern liberal theorists, have insisted that, on the contrary, democracies have an advantage over nondemocracies. In this timely return to an old debate, Kroenig makes the case that democratic states tend to “do better” than other types of states in great-power rivalries. Democracies have greater capacities for generating long-term economic growth, borrowing capital, building alliances, making international agreements, and sustaining stable and legitimate rule. Kroenig bundles these familiar arguments together and sets out on a fast-paced historical journey through the classic cases of competition between democratic great powers and autocratic ones: from Athens and Sparta, to medieval Venice and its rivals, to the United Kingdom and Germany in the twentieth century, and finally to the United States and the Soviet Union during the Cold War. Kroenig does not claim that democracies always prevail in war or succeed in building hegemony, but he does insist that democratic states can “punch above their weight.” The value of the book lies in framing an important question for today: In the United States’ growing competition with China, will its democracy be an advantage or a hindrance?"
65,Exit From Hegemony: The Unraveling of the American Global Order,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2020-04-14/exit-hegemony-unraveling-american-global-order,Exit From Hegemony: The Unraveling of the American Global Order,"In the aftermath of World War II, the United States built and presided over a liberal hegemonic order, which now seems to be unraveling. In this important book, Cooley and Nexon provide one of the best guides to understanding how global orders rise and fall. The United States’ postwar effort to create an international order—what the authors describe as an “ecosystem”—that was friendly to liberal democracies led Washington to emphasize open markets, multilateral cooperation, and liberal values, giving its hegemony a “liberal internationalist” cast. When the Soviet Union collapsed, the United States gained “patronage monopoly”: it was left as the only state with an existing framework for ordering international relations. Other states had few options but to integrate into Washington’s grand liberal ecosystem. The authors’ key insight is that all of this has now changed. With the rise of China and Russia, countries around the world have alternative suppliers of development assistance, military security, and public goods—in effect, countries now have “exit options” from U.S. hegemony. Beyond the illiberal order building of China and Russia, the exit from U.S. hegemony occurs primarily through “bottom-up” processes in which nongovernmental organizations, transnational political movements, and non-Western international organizations create geopolitical “niches” in which countries can escape the dominance of the United States."

67,A Few Good Men,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/review-essay/2020-04-06/few-good-men,A Few Good Men,"When Donald Trump was elected president of the United States, there was good cause to think that he would be popular with the armed forces. He was, for a start, a Republican, and the military leans heavily conservative. He had also run an ostentatiously pro-military campaign, promising to “rebuild the military, take care of vets and make the world respect the U.S. again!” There were, to be sure, some warning signs of trouble to come, such as when he attacked the war hero John McCain, a Republican senator from Arizona (“I like people who weren’t captured”), and belittled the parents of a soldier who had died in combat after they dared to criticize him."
68,The Climate Club,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2020-04-10/climate-club,The Climate Club,"Climate change is the major environmental challenge facing nations today, and it is increasingly viewed as one of the central issues in international relations. Yet governments have used a flawed architecture in their attempts to forge treaties to counter it. The key agreements, the 1997 Kyoto Protocol and the 2015 Paris climate accord, have relied on voluntary arrangements, which induce free-riding that undermines any agreement."
69,The Myanmar Mirage,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/review-essay/2020-04-14/myanmar-mirage,The Myanmar Mirage,"Just a few years ago, Myanmar (also called Burma) was widely seen as an international success story. In March 2011, after half a century of military rule, a quasi-civilian government led by the former general Thein Sein came to power and embarked on a remarkable campaign of political and economic reforms. Over the next year and a half, the government released dissidents, lifted press censorship, let the democratic icon Aung San Suu Kyi reenter politics after spending years under house arrest, and opened peace talks with more than a dozen rebel groups. President Thein Sein’s administration also took important steps to rationalize an economy distorted by decades of autarkic socialist policies and harsh Western sanctions."

The disputed territory -- a mostly desert region roughly the size of the United Kingdom and with a population of only several hundred thousand -- was a Spanish colony until the mid-1970s, when Spain ceded sovereignty to Morocco and Mauritania. This tripartite agreement ignored the 1975 International Court of Justice opinion in favor of self-determination and the claims made by the local nationalist movement, the Polisario Front, which soon turned to armed rebellion. Zunes and Mundy disentangle this complex history with skill, before turning to recent events. Their account is generally sympathetic to the local nationalist movement, which they view as authentically popular, and critical of Morocco's claims, which they see as motivated by interests within the Moroccan security apparatus and the lure of the rich fishing grounds off the territory's coast and the phosphate reserves in its soil. They are particularly critical of long-standing French and U.S. support for the Moroccan government on this issue, despite diplomatic pressure from various multilateral forums."
1,Atlas of the Transatlantic Slave Trade,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2011-03-01/atlas-transatlantic-slave-trade,Atlas of the Transatlantic Slave Trade,"For nearly 20 years, the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade Database project has been diligently tabulating all the slave ship crossings of the Atlantic Ocean, from 1500 to 1900. So far, it has recorded some 34,934 documented slave voyages -- probably about 80 percent of the total during this period -- which carried 12 and a half million Africans to the New World. With 189 informative and handsome maps, Eltis and Richardson relay and interpret the information contained in this rich database, mixing in beautiful historical illustrations and key passages from relevant texts. An accessible narrative, meanwhile, expands on the information in the maps. A history that remains poorly understood, despite its impact on both Africa and the Americas, comes to life in these pages, which establish in painstaking detail where the slaves came from in Africa, where they ended up in the New World, and when their voyages actually took place. The book even tracks such details as the changing slave mortality rate onboard, the number of slave uprisings on the ships, and the locations where, after the United Kingdom outlawed slavery in 1807, the British navy intervened. This marvelous book will change how people think of the slave trade. It deserves every accolade it is likely to get."

The 2009 South African Elections; Mandela: A Biography; Contemporary South Africa. 2nd ed,"South Africa is now well into its second decade of postapartheid rule, and these three recent books by South African scholars reveal a good deal about the country. Southall and Daniel's collection of essays reviews the April 2009 general elections, which witnessed both the emergence of Jacob Zuma as leader of the African National Congress and president of the country and the first significant cracks in the electoral dominance of the ANC, with the creation of a new party, the Congress of the People (COPE). In the end, COPE received only a little over seven percent of the vote, less than half of what the mostly white Democratic Alliance got. But Southall and Daniel's volume rates the emergence of COPE as the more significant event, since its support comes from core ANC voters. The book is deeply wary of Zuma, viewing his presidency as part of the ANC's drift into populist cronyism, and the authors bemoan what they view as the country's growing corruption. Only a stronger opposition with substantial support from the black majority, they argue, can bring about greater democratic accountability."
3,Political Reform in Indonesia After Soeharto,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2011-03-01/political-reform-indonesia-after-soeharto,Political Reform in Indonesia After Soeharto,"Peaceful transitions to democracy are as rare as they are desirable. As one of the most striking success stories, Indonesia offers important lessons. Crouch, a longtime Indonesia observer, shows how unlikely reform seemed when the authoritarian president Suharto resigned during an economic crisis in 1998, given the entrenched interests built into his ironically named New Order and the turbulence of Indonesia's hyper-fragmented society. Crouch focuses on six domains: the electoral system, central-local relations, the military, the judiciary, communal conflict (with a case study of the Maluku Islands), and separatism (with a case study of the territory of Aceh). And he examines two puzzles: why reform was launched in the midst of an economic crisis, and how reform deepened. In Indonesia, the underlying socioeconomic conditions, emphasized by some democratization theorists, were permissive but not favorable. Crouch's clear and close-up account reveals the importance of the crisis itself, an event that forced elites to improvise on the fly or face widespread disorder, and of negotiations among major interest groups emerging from the old regime. The implications are a bit scary: there is no road map for democratization. And luck and leadership play large roles."

He traveled to the Tibetan areas of China (which extend far beyond the Tibet Autonomous Region), to the seat of the Tibetan exile government in India, and to the headquarters of Tibetan organizations overseas. He interviewed the Dalai Lama; one of his possible successors, the Karmapa Lama; and other Tibetan figures in China and abroad. And he saw how strong the forces the Tibetan exile movement is up against are, not just because Beijing is committed to holding on to the strategic region but also because most members of China's ethnic Han majority lack sympathy for Tibetan complaints. Tibet is on lockdown. Foreign governments are less willing to support the overseas movement as China's influence grows, and Beijing's strategy to solve the Tibet problem with economic development, repression, and propaganda is failing."

Tokyo's defense establishment keeps its strategies vague for political and diplomatic reasons. But Oros and Tatsumi provide a clear account of the relevant organizations, policies, politics, and deployments that is useful as an introduction for beginners or as a synthesis for experts. Since the fall of the Soviet Union, Japan's main defense worries have been China and North Korea, followed by the security of Japan's maritime supply lines, which run all along China's 2,000 miles of coastline. In the authors' judgment, Japan's navy and air force are among the most advanced in the world, the defense alliance with the United States has its tensions but remains robust, and the twists and turns of Japan's domestic politics have not weakened its capabilities."

A Chinese-language officer, Platt worked in the U.S. consulate general in Hong Kong, the National Security Council, and the Pentagon. Most dramatically, he served as part of the select team that accompanied President Richard Nixon on his historic February 1972 trip to China and then as part of the small staff that set up the de facto U.S. embassy in Beijing, which was called the Liaison Office. Despite the well-reported bonhomie of Nixon's and Henry Kissinger's exchanges with Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai, Platt's reminiscences bring out the suspicions between the two sides that still shadow relations today. The memoir contains some tragic passages, such as that describing an accidental traffic death caused by Platt in Beijing, but many that are laugh-out-loud funny. All ring true."
7,Great Soul: Mahatma Gandhi and His Struggle With India,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2011-03-01/great-soul-mahatma-gandhi-and-his-struggle-india,Great Soul: Mahatma Gandhi and His Struggle With India,"Not a biography -- Lelyveld says there are already more than enough -- this is a meditation on the interlinked puzzles of Mohandas ""Mahatma"" Gandhi's strange personal disciplines, the communalistic passions of the two societies where Gandhi worked (South Africa and India), his improbable achievements against vast odds, and the ultimate failure of his ideals. Here is an eccentric who achieved mass followings; a near-naked vegetarian and celibate who, by force of will, made masses of people temporarily abjure the primitive passion of communal enmity; and an icon who is worshiped globally while the hatreds he opposed flourish. Lelyveld, who worked in both South Africa and India as a New York Times reporter, focuses on Gandhi's opposition to race, class, and caste oppression in the two societies. He weaves a dense fabric of social analysis, biographical detail, and psychological speculation; zooms out for context and in for anecdotes; shifts between past and present tenses; and scrambles the chronology to find patterns across time. The book tries to recenter one's understanding of Gandhi away from the themes of Indian nationalism and nonviolent political action and toward the issue of social justice, which remains sorely unresolved in both countries where Gandhi worked."
8,The Party: The Secret World of China's Communist Rulers,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2011-03-01/party-secret-world-chinas-communist-rulers,The Party: The Secret World of China’s Communist Rulers,"The secret to China's economic and diplomatic successes -- as well as its problems with corruption and human rights -- is the power of the country's small elite to manage all aspects of society, including itself. This straight-for-the-jugular account by the Financial Times' former Beijing bureau chief focuses on the Chinese Communist Party's control of businesses but also covers its methods of coordinating government operations, the military, and the media. The system is not seamless. McGregor analyzes factional disputes in the leadership, corruption in government and enterprises, and strains between commanders and commissars in the army. The secretive Organization Department, which manages cadres' careers, is key to the system's survival and, possibly, its eventual decay. At its best, the department vets rising officials based on performance across a range of indicators. At its worst, it promotes yes men and legacy brats. Its steady gaze motivates some local officials to excel and others to cover up their misdeeds. As long as the party remains the ultimate source of wealth and power, its ability to police itself will determine China's fate."

It covers the tortuous diplomacy of every U.S. presidency from Jimmy Carter to Barack Obama (with the essay on each administration written by someone who served in it), as well as Iran's relations with its neighbors and with China, Russia, and the EU. Fifty short biographies sketch the Iranian political elite, including those in power, those in opposition, and significant figures no longer living (such as the ayatollahs Ruhollah Khomeini and Hossein Ali Montazeri). Concise (almost every contributor was held to around three pages), comprehensive (it includes unexpected entries, such as one on bazaars), and well organized (with six separate thematic timelines), this is a beautifully wrought handbook. It is also an ongoing project, with its own Web site (iranprimer.usip.org), where new material is added."

Although oil has always figured prominently in Saudi studies, this book is surely the first to trace Saudi policies concerning oil and water since the 1920s. Jones presents these policies as dictated by a Saudi drive to create not so much a nation-state as an empire in the Arabian Peninsula. Saudi Arabia is not all desert, but the agriculturally more advantaged Eastern Province, with its appreciable Shiite population, has been the most disadvantaged when it comes to receiving a share of the government's development projects. This explains the Shiite uprising there in 1979 and the halting Saudi efforts thereafter to address the issue. Woven into this book is a pessimistic view of technologically driven policies, environmentalist reflections, and a harsh portrayal of selfishness on the part of both the Saudi state and the oil company it owns, Saudi Aramco."

He introduces readers to a handful of representative Iranians, including fervent supporters of the ""system"" (nizam), reformers, rebellious youth, and one often-evoked anonymous source, dubbed ""the sage."" Integrated into these accounts are fine aperçus distilled from sources free from control by the nizam -- blogs, traditional media, political exiles, and scholars inside and outside Iran. Peterson even gets into such illuminating minutiae as hard-liners fighting the insidious cultural influence of Barbie dolls. A chapter on ""the messiah hotline"" offers a nuanced treatment of not just Ahmadinejad's views but also the larger socioreligious import of Mahdist thinking in modern Iran. Peterson's coverage of the 2009 election, meanwhile, may well rank as the most thorough and balanced available."
12,Sayyid Qutb and the Origins of Radical Islamism,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2011-03-01/sayyid-qutb-and-origins-radical-islamism,Sayyid Qutb and the Origins of Radical Islamism,"The best biographies balance the person, the person's achievements, and the environment in which that person worked. This one of Sayyid Qutb (1906-66), considered by both friends and foes to be a founding father of radical Sunni Islamic thought, does just that. Calvert presents a portrait of Qutb worthy of a psychobiography, without the excesses of the genre. He traces the evolution of Qutb's political thought from secular nationalism to religious fundamentalism and situates Qutb's Islamism within Islamic political thought, past and present. And he presents the Egyptian political scene -- from the interwar years, to the 1952 Egyptian Revolution and the Nasser era it ushered in, up through the 1966 trial and execution of Qutb on the charge of planning a coup. Calvert, who in 2004 co-edited and co-translated Qutb's bildungsroman, A Child From the Village, has immersed himself in his chosen subject for years, and it shows. Throughout the book, Calvert engages with other commentators on Qutb. His conclusion shows how present-day Islamists read Qutb differently: moderates (such as mainstream Muslim Brothers) downplay his revolutionary religio-political message, and radicals (such as al Qaeda members) exaggerate it."

Instead of facile claims that Islam is the solution or Islam is the problem, readers get a detailed history of economic institutions in the Middle East as compared to those in the West. Kuran shows that the Islamic law and practices underlying Middle Eastern commerce worked well for a long time and were much more flexible than usually assumed. In time, however, they were overtaken by Western corporations, banks, and trading companies, which could assemble greater capital and survive longer, unlike Islamic partnerships that dissolved after the death of a partner. Kuran also turns his attention to primogeniture in the West, comparing it to the sundering of estates prescribed by Islamic law; Western trade treaties with Middle Eastern powers; and the Middle East's efforts to catch up to the West beginning in the nineteenth century. Clearly presented quantitative data and illuminating anecdotes (such as one about the late-sixteenth-century Egyptian merchant who, ""anticipating Starbucks,"" opened a chain of coffeehouses) add up to a fine feast."

Georgia under Eduard Shevardnadze, who led Georgia from 1993 to 2003, raised U.S. and European expectations and, with them, proportionately large sums of money to make them come true. But as Mitchell describes, although Georgia in that era was freer than most of its neighbors, it also slid into the ditch of corruption and economic incompetence. Eventually, Shevardnadze ""tried to steal one too many elections."" The ""accidental revolution"" this fathered, although genuinely popular, was scarcely democratic. Those who led it, for all their indisputable success in fighting corruption, salvaging a badly decayed infrastructure, and rallying public support, have attended far more to strengthening and modernizing the state than building democracy -- priorities Washington has mostly excused. So, Mitchell argues, in its democracy-promotion efforts, the United States should be more critical of its perceived democratic allies, less focused on single benchmarks such as elections, and more attuned to the many elements needed to create an engaged citizenry."
15,Gulag Boss: A Soviet Memoir,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2011-03-01/gulag-boss-soviet-memoir,Gulag Boss: A Soviet Memoir,"Mochulsky was 22 years old and had just graduated from engineering school when he was selected by the NKVD (the KGB's dreaded predecessor) to command prison laborers in Stalin's gulag in the frozen Arctic north. Much later, in his 70s, with his successful 40-year career in the Soviet diplomatic corps and the KGB behind him, Mochulsky told his story. It is both revealing and chilling precisely because he is neither a sadist nor a cynic, nor is he unmindful of the awful enterprise of which he was a part from 1940 to 1946. But for him, the central issue was getting on with the task, building a railroad in inhumanly harsh conditions. What the memoir teaches is how cogs in the gulag machine, even when troubled by the cruelty and injustice around them, accepted the rationalizations given by the state. They went about their work and, without many questions, moved on to comfortable, prosaic careers. That is, unless the horror of the Gulag had driven them to suicide or out of their minds."

The central bank declared that it would buy $600 billion in long-term Treasury bonds in an attempt to push down long-term interest rates. Immediately after the move, the rest of the world accused the United States of deliberately attempting to depreciate the dollar."

Not so, argue Jones Luong and Weinthal. A great deal of venerated theory, they claim, has erred by generalizing from trends during one historical era (1970-90) and, in particular, by overlooking a critical intermediate factor -- the nature of resource ownership. In the end, whether a well-endowed country has a government that pursues policies promoting fiscal integrity, long-term growth, and a more equitable distribution of economic benefits depends on who owns and manages the oil and gas. Of the four types of ownership the book identifies, that in which the bulk of the oil or gas is under private title and management does the best, and the type in which the state displaces both private and foreign investors does the worst. The other two types, those with either a dominant role for foreign firms or with a division between state ownership and private management, fall in between, the former being better than the latter. The authors use the five post-Soviet states blessed with hydrocarbons but having different ownership models (Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Russia, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan) to make their case -- a case laid out in a rigorous yet lucid fashion."

It is not an easy argument to make given the impediments to the tribunal's success, its own deficiencies, and the headwind of skepticism coming from the analytic community over the effectiveness of such tribunals. All of this she accepts, but then -- thanks to a carefully crafted superstructure drawing together different theoretical literatures and, in particular, ten years of exacting research, much of it conducted in the region -- Nettelfield makes a compelling case for the ICTY's larger positive effects. Whether directly, indirectly, or sometimes negatively, it has fostered new assumptions about ""justice and accountability"" among Bosnians, stirred the formation of civil-society groups determined to fight for these things, and helped create local court institutions capable of carrying on the work. It helps that she lays out the many parts of the argument in clear, jargon-free prose."

The world knew one of them as Rudolf Abel, but he was actually a Briton named William Fisher, who was brought to the Soviet Union as a child by parents captivated by Lenin's revolution, recruited into the KGB, and eventually made head of its operations in North America, until he was betrayed in 1957. Everyone knew Francis Gary Powers' name after his U-2 spy plane was shot down high over the Soviet Union, an incident that spoiled the 1960 Paris summit. And no one knew of Frederic Pryor, an American graduate student in Berlin arrested by the East German Stasi in 1961 as a spy, which he was not. In 1962, in a carefully choreographed prisoner exchange on Berlin's Glienicke Bridge and at Checkpoint Charlie, these three men were handed over to their respective countrymen. The story's utterly fascinating elements are Fisher's life as a spy and Powers' part in the U-2 enterprise, recounted in meticulous detail by Whittell. The stakes in both instances may not have been as dramatic as he claims, but the events were emblematic of the Cold War's more shadowy and adventurous aspects."

Many excellent studies have mined the archives to shed light on different aspects of the Cold War, but until this book, none has traced the history in such a seamless, comprehensive fashion. Haslam not only exploited familiar archives but also prowled through a prodigiously wide range of unexplored archival material, including the private papers of key participants. What he discovered in the previously untapped testimony of aides and subordinates to key Soviet officials offers the most interesting and surprising insights into Soviet decision-making. On the larger picture, he dissents from those who dismiss the impact of ideology and view Soviet behavior as primarily a function of either Stalin's personality or a narrow but aggressive raison d'état. He also, however, has no patience for those who believe that Soviet ideology had more to do with fear and misperception than ambition, and who, therefore, underestimate the aggressive side to the ideological impulse."

For those who are persuaded that reading original source documents is an indispensable methodology for grasping historical events in their proper context, the editors have again performed an invaluable service. Their selection of 138 excerpted documents underscores the hegemonic presumptions of many U.S. leaders over two centuries while giving some space to more contemporary U.S. initiatives to promote inter-American cooperation and democratic practices, from John F. Kennedy's Alliance for Progress to Bill Clinton's Summit of the Americas. Recurrent Latin American rebelliousness against U.S. power is amply, perhaps disproportionately, recorded; readers get the anti-imperialist poetry of the Nicaraguan modernist Rubén Darío and the contemporary Cuban folksinger Silvio Rodríguez and heated speeches by the neopopulists Hugo Chávez and Evo Morales, but they also hear from the great Argentine economist Raúl Prebisch. Altogether, this handy collection should inspire students and experts alike to dig more deeply into the historical archives."

Some of the featured projects involve the construction of low-cost housing in Chile, the production of processed cacti in Mexico, and the provision of health care to migrant coffee workers in Costa Rica. Such initiatives not only measurably improve the welfare of the poor but also enhance their capacity to exercise citizenship; it is this vibrant social capital as much as specific skills that empowers them. The expert commission that selected the cases searched for the ability to replicate: the Chilean housing project, which involves university student volunteers and private-sector sponsors, has already spread quickly throughout Latin America. The final challenge is for governments to adopt these social innovations as their own and scale them up to the level of national policy."

In A New Trade Policy for the United States, a collection of six brief, sharp essays, Arana (a Nicaraguan) and González (a Costa Rican) separately reflect on the U.S.- Central American Free Trade Agreement. Despite their evident enthusiasm for the treaty, these two leading trade negotiators reveal some lingering resentment of the disruptive role played by aggressive U.S. interest groups and their congressional allies. Similarly, the Mexican academic Studer rips into U.S. labor organizations for pushing so hard to include labor standards in trade accords, only to ignore the institutions the accords created. From the perspective of Latin American countries, it is time to move beyond litigious sanctions regimes and build trade capacity, address the disruptive societal effects related to trade, and strengthen domestic safety nets. Arguably, the Obama administration has been doing just these things, albeit piecemeal, by supporting technical community colleges, promoting universal health care, and extending unemployment insurance."
24,Latin America's Cold War,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2011-03-01/latin-americas-cold-war,Latin America’s Cold War,"Brands takes aim at those mainstream historians writing on Western Hemispheric relations who have portrayed the United States as an overwhelmingly powerful hegemon whose destructive interventions are responsible for the region's sufferings. Delving into Latin American archives, Brands counters that Latin Americans have been active participants in their own history -- in both their domestic politics and international diplomacy. During the Cold War, Washington and Moscow often had poor understandings of these local dynamics, so their ill-designed policies frequently failed; even those strategies that momentarily succeeded generated blowback and unintended consequences. As Brands persuasively argues, the true story of Latin America's role in the Cold War lies in the dynamic interactions between international forces and domestic actors. Tragically, both the United States and the Soviet Union exacerbated the region's already polarized politics, and the ensuing violent clashes rendered asunder fragile democracies. Fortunately, today many citizens in Latin America and many in Washington policy circles have drawn the right lessons from history, seeking to strengthen democratic institutions -- and not overreacting to the provocations of the latest crop of neopopulists."

Measured by trade, immigration, or diplomacy, it is among the world's most open countries. Yet its politics and society, not to mention its unintelligible dialect of German, remain closed to outsiders. What most people know are traditional clichés. Austria markets itself with The Sound of Music, Mozart, and Alpine skiing. Critics attack it the same way: the recent success of a provincial right-wing party led many to view Austria as a land of incorrigible neofascists, for which it was sanctioned by the EU. Lendvai, a top journalist with 50 years of insider access to Viennese circles, offers a more sober perspective on Austrian political life. He unpacks the backroom deals, personal idiosyncrasies, and, above all, partisan maneuvering behind successive governments. This gossipy approach leaves one wishing to know more about social and cultural trends, rising immigration, economic globalization, European enlargement, and the other things that have transformed Austria into one of contemporary Europe's most successful countries. For understanding elite party politics, however, there is no better place to start."

It has abolished tariffs, established a common currency, and spread peace and prosperity to new democracies across Europe. Yet most observers agree that the basic motivations underlying European integration are banal: to facilitate business transactions, coordinate regulatory systems, and get rich quicker on an exceedingly interdependent continent. Few Europeans are true believers in a federal ideal, and their national political identities are not converging. Each of the 27 national debates among intellectuals and commentators about the meaning of Europe remains insular and idiosyncratic. This creative volume brings together a pan-European team to present these diverse discussions and reflect on the differences and similarities among them. Unlike traditional federalist supporters of Europe (and their nationalist critics), the authors assembled here do not view the continent's ideological diversity as evidence of the EU's failure. The fact that one finds new ideas and approaches each time one crosses one of the (now invisible) borders within the EU is instead, they argue, a unique source of strength, resilience, and creativity."

His story appeals especially to those who believe that a ""great man"" armed with a grand vision and traditional wisdom about statecraft can still make a mark in a chaotic world. No doubt, de Gaulle's policies revitalized France, domestically and internationally. In the 1960s, his assertion of an independent French nuclear capability, call for a new bargain with NATO, expansive notion of national sovereignty, support for the gold standard, pursuit of dirigiste economic planning, and sympathy for nonalignment triggered panic in other Western capitals but made France a prominent global player. In retrospect, however, de Gaulle's greatest foreign policy achievements were unrelated to the concerns of his contemporary critics: a more supranational European Union, the definitive end of French colonialism, France's strengthened international economic status, and a stiffer Western resolve in Berlin. This book presents some of the best work from a new generation of historians seeking to understand the tensions between rhetoric and reality in this enigmatic statesman."

In the 1980s and 1990s, Ireland, once an impoverished backwater from which generations fled, conjured an economic miracle. Fueled by foreign direct investment and real estate speculation, the ""Celtic tiger"" became a vibrant consumer society with high-tech industry and widespread homeownership, a place to which immigrants flocked. After 2007, the party ended in a morass of insolvent banks, bad mortgages, and unpaid public debt, ultimately sending the proudly independent country begging to the International Monetary Fund. As befits a Bloomberg reporter, Lynch peppers his account of these events with numbers and descriptions of boardroom antics and complex financial deals. As in any good Irish yarn, however, more memorable are the larger-than-life personalities. Seán FitzPatrick turned the tiny Anglo Irish Bank into a financial giant, only to play golf while it collapsed, after which he retired on his wife's generous pension and stuck the government with a $17 billion bill. Yet amid all the details, this well-reported narrative leaves one wondering exactly what crucial mistake Ireland made. Was it financial and political corruption, incompetent financial regulation, membership in the eurozone, a misguided faith in low-tax policies, an overreliance on foreign investment, fundamental imbalances in the economy, the guaranteeing of toxic assets, or Irish cultural beliefs -- or all of the above?"
29,Immigration and Conflict in Europe,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2011-03-01/immigration-and-conflict-europe,Immigration and Conflict in Europe,"Foreigners looking to Europe often see the stereotype of a strife-torn continent of intolerant secularists threatened by teeming masses of religious radicals. Yet scholars who study the politics of immigration in Europe find more complex and nuanced patterns. One of the best efforts to make sense of it all is this book by Dancygier on the sources of immigration politics in Germany and the United Kingdom. She refutes the polemics of Islamophobes by showing that beliefs about ethnicity and religion on the ground have almost nothing to do with the patterns of discord. Instead, clashes tend to break out over scarce public resources, such as housing, schools, and state jobs. Where immigrants succeed in claiming their share of such resources, natives often signal their restlessness by voting for radical right parties or harassing their foreign-born neighbors. Where immigrants fail to gain these resources, they themselves are likely to protest violently against the state. Statistical data and insightful urban case studies confirm this, as does a concluding section extending the argument across Europe."

C Street takes readers from the halls of Congress to the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan and the hotels of Uganda to show the vast conspiracy at work. Sharlet puts his finger on some troubling phenomena, particularly evidence of religious intolerance and indoctrination in parts of the U.S. military. But a deeper reading of Christian (and especially evangelical) history would have spared him some angst. Ever since the religious revivals of the early nineteenth century, well-connected and pious Americans have been organizing themselves to proselytize. The United States is littered with organizations once dedicated to that purpose but now used for other things (the YMCA and Oberlin College, for example), and U.S. missionaries have been engaged in the politics of the developing world for two centuries. But somehow after all these generations, the United States is not a theocracy yet, and the pluralistic country of today is substantially less vulnerable to the imposition of evangelical orthodoxy than ever before."

Sifting through enormous amounts of data about American society, they come up with riveting and sometimes disconcerting insights into the ways religion shapes and is shaped by the political and social currents of American life. Sympathetic to many religious and nonreligious views but captured by none, Putnam and Campbell present a suitably complex and balanced view of the many changes taking place. ""Anglo"" Catholics (descendants of Irish, Italian, and Polish immigrants) are leaving a church that is rapidly becoming Hispanic; mainline Protestantism continues to decline; African Americans of all educational levels are among the most religious of Americans; the explosion of white evangelicalism appears to be over. The fastest-growing group consists of those who say they do not belong to any religion, but only a minority of these people identify as atheists. Americans change religions frequently, and most Americans have friends or family in religious groups other than their own, so the authors tentatively conclude that Americans remain religious while growing increasingly tolerant."

Four of them -- Hugo Black, Felix Frankfurter, William Douglas, and Robert Jackson -- are among the most influential justices in U.S. history. Feldman looks at how these men came to the Court, how their ideas developed there, and how their interplay and rivalries reshaped constitutional thought and the balance of power in the republic. Originally all liberal allies of the New Deal, the Roosevelt appointees only gradually came to understand just how radically different their judicial philosophies were. Feldman follows both the intellectual and the personal stories of their descent into enmity and traces many of the questions that perplex court watchers today back to the New Deal. The book climaxes with the story of how the judges were able to reach unanimity in Brown v. Board of Education and demonstrates Feldman's admirable ability to weave a compelling narrative out of a complicated and abstract plot."

If anybody was in any doubt, The Whites of Their Eyes lays the question to rest. Lepore, a Harvard professor, Pulitzer Prize nominee, and New Yorker staff writer, brings to this book great erudition, along with a richly layered vision of the American Revolution and the uses to which it has been put by various generations since. Even though that vision lists mostly to port, readers of every political persuasion will learn about the Revolution and its place in American memory. But Lepore's point -- that liberals really love and understand their country, while Tea Party conservatives just make noise -- is undermined by her failure to engage more deeply with the convictions and perceptions of the Tea Party members she uses as foils for her views. She seems less interested in figuring out what these people really mean than in deriding the simplistic and ahistorical ideas they express. A historian who took this attitude toward her sources would produce superficial and unsatisfactory work; Lepore enjoys herself perhaps a little too much as she contrasts the richness and humanity of her own views with the tawdry errors of the common herd."
34,Decision Points,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2011-03-01/decision-points,Decision Points,"History will not remember Bush as a great prose stylist, and he does himself no favors by invoking the memoirs of Ulysses S. Grant as a model at the start of Decision Points. But despite the long stretches of flat and featureless writing, Bush's memoirs are nevertheless rewarding in their own way. When Bush comes to the critical moments of his presidency -- 9/11, the decision to invade Iraq, Hurricane Katrina, the troop surge in Iraq -- a fierce urgency enters the book as the still raw emotions of those events bring out a more engaged and intense side of the normally laid-back former president. Decision Points is less than a full-throated defense of everything the Bush administration did. There are more apologies than complaints in the book; Bush acknowledges missteps and only rarely stoops to settle scores with the congressional and journalistic critics who attacked his administration so bitterly. But the apologies are more often about style than substance. Bush deeply believes he did the right thing when the chips were down. History will be the judge of that. This book effectively presents him as a sincere man who did the best he could in the face of unprecedented challenges. It was clearly not always enough."

Eisenhower and the Military Industrial Complex; The Civilian and the Military: A History of the American Antimilitarist Tradition,"Once upon a time, Republican presidents worried about deficit spending and were reluctant to be talked into unnecessary defense expenditures by lobbyists inflating threats. Large peacetime military establishments were considered risks to American democracy and security. President Dwight Eisenhower shared these concerns sufficiently to warn in his valedictory address about the ""unwarranted influence"" of ""the military-industrial complex"" -- a warning that reflected his background in industrial mobilization and his experience in office. He came under enormous pressure to authorize the purchase of expensive military systems, often by retired officers who had joined corporate boards. In Unwarranted Influence, Ledbetter traces how the speech came about and charts its later influences, refuting those who claimed it sank without trace."

Walter Bedell Smith, known as ""Beetle,"" first saw action in World War I, rose to become General Dwight Eisenhower's chief of staff in World War II, and ended his career as the number two in the State Department during Eisenhower's presidency. Victor Krulak, known as ""Brute,"" watched the rise of Japanese aggression as an intelligence officer in Shanghai in the 1930s and was active in the Pacific theater during World War II, leading a raid on the Solomon Islands and helping plan the invasion of Okinawa. He rose through the Marine Corps, making himself an expert on counterinsurgency, until he eventually fell out with President Lyndon Johnson over Vietnam. Shelton saw action in Vietnam and was involved in a series of later operations, from the U.S. invasion of Panama in 1989 through the 1991 Persian Gulf War. He became chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff under President Bill Clinton, overseeing the Kosovo intervention, and retired just after 9/11, as the Afghanistan campaign was getting under way."

One reason he suggests for the duration is that both sides have fought poorly, with the two main offensive operations -- 9/11 and the invasion of Iraq -- calamitous strategic errors from which neither has fully recovered. Osama bin Laden could and should have been captured at Tora Bora as the Taliban retreated in Afghanistan in late 2001. His survival and continuing propaganda have given al Qaeda an endurance it might have otherwise lacked, although the group has been hampered by both its limited operational impact, as in Europe and North America, and the loss of would-be constituents who are turned off by its harsh methods, as in Iraq. So despite occasional tactical successes, the organization's prognosis is poor. Even though much of the book covers familiar ground and there is too much of a focus on bin Laden, Bergen knows his subject, which makes reading The Longest War a helpful way to take stock of a difficult decade."

Eventually, determined entrepreneurs met the technical challenges of converting a bitter bean into the many delicious forms of chocolate familiar today. The three English firms -- Fry, Cadbury, and Rowntree -- were run by Quaker families, and the founder of the American one, Milton Hershey, had gone to a Quaker school. All the companies were imbued with a strong sense of social responsibility, founding orphanages, creating model towns, and engaging in other good works as they prospered. The main focus of Chocolate Wars is Cadbury (sold to the American company Kraft Foods in 2009), whose managers found themselves, among other activities, combating slavery in Portuguese Africa in the early twentieth century and devising a code for good corporate governance more recently."

Of this, $3 trillion was invested outside the countries of ownership. The largest fund is the Japanese government's $1.3 trillion pension fund, a quarter of which is invested abroad, and the second-largest fund belongs to Abu Dhabi. Americans may be surprised to learn that some sovereign wealth funds are owned by U.S. state governments, the largest being California's public employee retirement system, followed by Alaska's permanent fund. In a period in which many financial institutions have been trying to replenish their capital, these patient investors are particularly welcome. But government ownership also raises concerns about the use of these large investments to pursue political objectives or manipulate financial markets. In this book, Truman, a former long-serving official of the U.S. Federal Reserve, usefully arrays what facts are known about sovereign wealth funds (some funds are much more secretive than others), analyzes the legitimate concerns about them, and evaluates them according to a scorecard of desirable behavior. Many funds have now subscribed to the IMF-sponsored Santiago Principles, a code of good behavior proposed in late 2008. Truman urges that these guidelines be made universal, stronger, and more formal and be better enforced."

(Surprisingly, she does not analyze the related service of sewage disposal.) Twenty years ago, privatizing the supply of water was high on the agendas of some economists and development agencies. Reviewing experiences since then, Bakker concludes that either mode of ownership is quite capable of providing inadequate service, particularly to the urban poor, her principal interest. Publicly owned suppliers are too often viewed as sources of patronage jobs or contracts; private providers too often channel the efficiency gains they achieve to shareholders rather than to customers, which is perhaps unsurprising given the lack of competition in the sector. Bakker cautiously concludes that the best arrangement is a combination of the two approaches: public ownership with private management under contract."

It is a personalized account of Akula's motivations, his tribulations in dealing with India's bureaucracies and extortionist gangsters, his gradual but ultimately outstanding success in raising capital to finance rural lending, and the rewards of seeing thousands of poor rural women take initial steps up the economic ladder. Microfinance has come under criticism for profiting from what some view as charitable work. Akula makes a vigorous defense of drawing in capital, largely on the grounds that it permits the much more rapid extension of credit to many more people who need it. He also defends the practice of charging an interest rate (28 percent) high enough to cover the actual costs of reaching remote villages and to provide a competitive return on the risk."

It underlines the importance of new sources of money, above all silver, in understanding the rises and falls of ambitious rulers and their dependence on lenders in Bavaria, Genoa, Antwerp, and, ultimately, Amsterdam to sustain their expensive enterprises. The biggest bonanza was the discovery of silver in Potosí (located in today's Bolivia), whose large output was augmented by major improvements in extraction technology. The silver traveled eastward to Europe (mainly to repay lenders and to pay troops, but also to build and replace the Spanish Armada) and westward to finance growing trade with China, whose demand for silver seemed unlimited. This period was similar to the present in two respects: it was marked by globalization (the spread of diseases and cultivable plants, including cacao, changed the world forever) and fiscal profligacy."
43,The Last Utopia: Human Rights in History,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2011-03-01/last-utopia-human-rights-history,The Last Utopia: Human Rights in History,"Most accounts of the human rights movement begin with the crystallization of ideas about ""the rights of man"" during the Enlightenment, ideas that were ushered onto the world stage during the American and French Revolutions in the eighteenth century, pushed forward by antislavery and anticolonial movements in the nineteenth century, and made universal in the 1940s with the establishment of the United Nations and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. In this provocatively revisionist history, Moyn argues that the decisive move occurred more recently. Until the 1970s, Moyn claims, human rights were still primarily secured by sovereign states. What was new and revolutionary in that decade was the notion that rights were entitlements that existed ""above and outside"" the sovereign state, a concept that served as a rallying call for human rights movements across Europe, Latin America, and the United States. But what Moyn fails to fully appreciate is that the deep subversiveness of ideas about ""the rights of man"" had existed since the Enlightenment, poised to unsettle more traditional notions of citizens and the state.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

Part autobiography and part political treatise, his book journeys through the recent past, relating the highs and lows of global governance. At the United Nations, where Malloch-Brown started in the 1980s, the organization labored under its bureaucratic weight and political stalemate but began to find a successful role in peacekeeping and humanitarian operations. At the World Bank, he joined others in pushing for political reforms in addition to market reforms. Malloch-Brown argues that as global challenges mount, states will find it harder to deliver security and welfare for their citizens and so the demand for international cooperation will grow.

In this new age of chaotic transnational struggles, governments, international organizations, nongovernmental organizations, and corporations will all compete on a sprawling multidimensional playing field. Seeking to emphasize the revolutionary character of this global change, Khanna rolls out a long list of evocative terms -- ""fragmented world,"" ""hyper-complex ecosystem,"" ""post-industrial age,"" ""islands of governance,"" ""world of complexes,"" ""neo-medieval world,"" and ""post-modern Middle Ages."" Since no superpower or group of states is in control, Khanna argues, the United Nations and other traditional institutions are outdated, and the world can be governed only by ""mega-diplomacy."" It is not entirely clear what this is, but apparently it entails new combinations of actors working together to coordinate actions and policies. The book provides journalistic portraits of various global trouble spots -- failed states, terrorist enclaves, disputed territories -- and the various states and international groups that have intervened. It also offers impressionistic renderings of modern-day world politics. What is missing is a worked-out theory of international order and change and a coherent account of the rise and fall of the modern state."

Nye shows that economic and military capabilities still matter but that their uses in the modern era place a greater premium on information, communication, and legitimate authority. Power, Nye argues, must be understood in relational terms, disaggregated into its various dimensions, and viewed within specific geographic and historical contexts. These premises make him skeptical of the widely anticipated decline of the United States. It is true that China is growing rapidly, but observers often ignore the United States' durable military and soft-power advantages. In Nye's view, the diffusion of power may be as consequential as power transitions between major states. So the United States' soft power and open society may actually give the country new power advantages in the twenty-first century."

Yet as this groundbreaking book argues, religion has staged a comeback nearly everywhere -- even in famously secular Europe. The book's intriguing thesis is that contrary to secularization theories, the resurgence of religion has been propelled by democracy and modernization rather than extinguished by it. Two great shifts have brought religion back into politics: the growth of the political independence of Christian, Hindu, Jewish, and Muslim groups from the institutions of government has allowed them to exercise greater leverage over the state, and the development of more activist ""political theologies"" has given the groups new messages about how to pursue God's will in politics. Meanwhile, thanks to television and the Internet, it has become easier to transmit religiously inspired ideas across borders -- as Hindu nationalists, Turkish Muslims, and the Christian right in the United States have discovered."

The Israel Defense Forces targeted urban infrastructure in Gaza, devastating populated areas as they attempted to end the barrage of Qassam rockets fired indiscriminately by Hamas toward southern Israeli cities. The war ended inconclusively in January, when Israel declared a unilateral cease-fire amid concerns about mounting civilian casualties. But the conflict shifted from Gaza to Geneva in April, when the UN Human Rights Council appointed former South African judge Richard Goldstone -- chief UN prosecutor in Yugoslavia and Rwanda during the 1990s -- to lead a fact-finding mission to Gaza.

Mistrust of Beijing throughout the region and in Washington is palpable. Observers claim that China has become more assertive, revising its grand strategy to reflect its own rise and the United States' decline since the financial crisis began in 2008. In fact, China's counterproductive policies toward its neighbors and the United States are better understood as reactive and conservative rather than assertive and innovative. Beijing's new, more truculent posture is rooted in an exaggerated sense of China's rise in global power and serious domestic political insecurity. As a result, Chinese policymakers are hypersensitive to nationalist criticism at home and more rigid -- at times even arrogant -- in response to perceived challenges abroad."

On the other hand, the Chinese government has yet to disclose any document that comprehensively expounds the country's strategic goals and the ways to achieve them. For both policy analysts in China and China watchers abroad, China's grand strategy is a field still to be plowed."
56,The Indian-Pakistani Divide,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/review-essay/2011-02-20/indian-pakistani-divide,The Indian-Pakistani Divide,"Since 1995, when the historian Ayesha Jalal's pathbreaking and controversial book Democracy and Authoritarianism in South Asia was published, there has been no serious study comparing the political trajectories of India and Pakistan. Those who have tried to fill this gap have succumbed to the temptation of attributing India's democracy to Hinduism and Pakistan's autocracy to Islam -- a reductionist and not particularly productive approach, since religion is usually only secondary in explaining political trajectories, whether it is Indonesia's democratization or Sri Lanka's march to dictatorship. In the remarkable India, Pakistan, and Democracy, Philip Oldenburg, a research scholar at Columbia University, is wise enough not to resort to such sociocultural explanations. Instead, he examines historical, political, sociological, cultural, and external factors to explain the reasons why India and Pakistan diverged."
57,How al Qaeda Works,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/south-asia/2011-02-20/how-al-qaeda-works,How al Qaeda Works,"Despite nearly a decade of war, al Qaeda is stronger today than when it carried out the 9/11 attacks. Before 2001, its history was checkered with mostly failed attempts to fulfill its most enduring goal: the unification of other militant Islamist groups under its strategic leadership. However, since fleeing Afghanistan to Pakistan's tribal areas in late 2001, al Qaeda has founded a regional branch in the Arabian Peninsula and acquired franchises in Iraq and the Maghreb. Today, it has more members, greater geographic reach, and a level of ideological sophistication and influence it lacked ten years ago."
58,Getting China to Sanction Iran,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2011-02-20/getting-china-sanction-iran,Getting China to Sanction Iran,"For more than three decades, the United States has tried to persuade the international community to counter the threat posed by Iran's Islamic regime. The results have often been underwhelming, with even Washington's closest allies resisting tough measures against Iran because of strategic considerations and commercial interests."
59,Arms Sales for India,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/india/2011-02-18/arms-sales-india,Arms Sales for India,"Much has been made of U.S. President Barack Obama's pledge to support India's push for a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council, which was offered during his November trip to India, but the real story from his visit was its implications for bilateral military trade. During the trip, Obama announced that the United States would sell $5 billion worth of U.S. military equipment to India, including ten Boeing C-17 military transport aircraft and 100 General Electric F-414 fighter aircraft. Although the details are still being worked out, these and other contracts already in the works will propel the United States into the ranks of India's top three military suppliers, alongside Russia and Israel. With India planning to buy $100 billion worth of new weapons over the next ten years, arms sales may be the best way for the United States to revive stagnating U.S.-Indian relations."
60,The Post-Washington Consensus,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2011-02-16/post-washington-consensus,The Post-Washington Consensus,"The last time a global depression originated in the United States, the impact was devastating not only for the world economy but for world politics as well. The Great Depression set the stage for a shift away from strict monetarism and laissez-faire policies toward Keynesian demand management. More important, for many it delegitimized the capitalist system itself, paving the way for the rise of radical and antiliberal movements around the world."
61,The Tea Party and American Foreign Policy,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2011-03-01/tea-party-and-american-foreign-policy,The Tea Party and American Foreign Policy,"During the night of December 16, 1773, somewhere between 30 and 130 men, a few disguised as Mohawk Indians, boarded three merchant ships in Boston Harbor and destroyed 342 chests of tea to protest duties imposed by the British parliament. Samuel Adams was widely considered to be the ringleader of the demonstration. The historical record is ambiguous; he disclaimed all responsibility while doing everything possible to publicize the event. The next year, a more decorous tea party occurred in Edenton, North Carolina, when Mrs. Penelope Barker convened 51 women to support the colony's resistance to British taxation. Tea was neither destroyed nor consumed, but something even more momentous happened that day: Barker's gathering is believed to have been the first women's political meeting in British North America."
62,A G-Zero World,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/world/g-zero-world,A G-Zero World,"This is not a G-20 world. Over the past several months, the expanded group of leading economies has gone from a would-be concert of nations to a cacophony of competing voices as the urgency of the financial crisis has waned and the diversity of political and economic values within the group has asserted itself. Nor is there a viable G-2 -- a U.S.-Chinese solution for pressing transnational problems -- because Beijing has no interest in accepting the burdens that come with international leadership. Nor is there a G-3 alternative, a grouping of the United States, Europe, and Japan that might ride to the rescue."

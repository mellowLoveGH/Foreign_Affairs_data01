0,Inequality,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/issue-packages/2015-12-08/inequality,What’s Inside,"Back in 1980, Irving Kristol, the “godfather of neoconservatism,” wrote an essay mocking the left’s obsession with income inequality: “The intensity with which economists work out their Gini coefficients, and the subtlety with which they measure income trends in the quintiles or deciles of the population, is matched—so far as I can see—by the utter lack of interest of the average American in their findings.” Having been impressed at the time by what seemed his cool logic, I checked back recently to see how the piece held up in the Age of Piketty. In retrospect, what was most striking was the setup: “It is my understanding, from surveying various studies of trends in income distribution in the United States over the past three decades, that economists have found very little significant change to have taken place.” That was then; this is now. Were Irving still around to chime in, he would probably continue to mock. But ever the empiricist, he would have to concede that the objective realities of the situation had changed dramatically. Over the intervening years, real incomes and wealth have stagnated for the vast majority of Americans, even as they have skyrocketed for those at the very top. With some national variations, moreover, something similar has happened across the developed world. These trends are starting to define our era. But what is driving them? What is the significance of the economic inequality that has resulted? And what can or should be done about it? These are the questions this issue’s lead package tackles. Ronald Inglehart explains both the fall and the rise of inequality over the last century as the product of the shifting balance of power between elites and masses, which has in turn been driven by the process of modernization. François Bourguignon points out that rising inequality within countries has been matched and probably exceeded by lowered inequality among countries, thanks mostly to sustained growth in China and India. Pierre Rosanvallon and Danielle Allen note that economic inequality cannot be separated from social and political inequality—and that what a healthy democracy requires is not simply the lessening of extreme material differences but also the nurturing of a community in which all citizens share opportunity and dignity. Anthony Atkinson and Jonathan Tepperman, finally, address possible remedies, the former reviewing options for egalitarian policies in the developed world and the latter telling the story of Brazil’s successful antipoverty program Bolsa Família. The old saw about frogs and boiling water is not true, of course: they will jump out of the pot if they can as the temperature rises. Democratic publics, increasingly feeling the heat, are unlikely to behave differently."

2,A Strong Start,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/united-states/strong-start,A Strong Start,"Gideon Rose (“What Obama Gets Right,” September/October 2015) gives U.S. President Barack Obama generally high marks for his handling of foreign policy, but among his criticisms, Rose claims that Obama’s “initial flirtation with leftist pieties about nuclear disarmament predictably came to nothing.” This is a caricature of the Obama administration’s nuclear policies and represents a failure to recognize the place of nuclear disarmament in the international order Rose correctly praises Obama for trying to bolster."
3,Making Sense of the Central African Republic,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2015-12-11/making-sense-central-african-republic,Making Sense of the Central African Republic,"This sprawling collection of essays is the first book-length English-language study of the Central African Republic. Such neglect is predictable given that the landlocked CAR is desperately poor and boasts virtually no natural resources. But the CAR’s history of failed state building, instability, and civil violence, which has led to a succession of international peacekeeping interventions since the mid-1990s, is very much worth examining. A sharp essay by Stephen Smith places the current instability in historical context. Greedy national elites have always preferred to appropriate public resources for their private use rather than grow the national economy or govern effectively. Today, they view international peacekeeping efforts as merely another trough at which to feed. Yet the book’s chapters on the international community’s woefully inadequate interventions also help explain the lack of local buy-in. The need for more effective international engagement is obvious, but the book is frustratingly silent on what better interventions might look like."
4,Nigeria: A New History of a Turbulent Century,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2015-12-11/nigeria-new-history-turbulent-century,Nigeria: A New History of a Turbulent Century,"This very readable history provides an excellent introduction to Africa’s most populous country. It begins with a look at British colonial rule, which established sharp economic, cultural, and political divisions in Nigeria, most dramatically between its northern and southern halves. These tensions undermined any sense of national unity and were exacerbated by the emergence of competitive politics after World War II and, eventually, independence, which came in 1960. Bourne expertly walks the reader through the political deterioration that led to the Nigerian Civil War, which raged from 1967 until 1970 and ended with the defeat of separatists from the southern state of Biafra. He then covers the subsequent decades of military rule and the slow and inconsistent democratization that began in 2000 and culminated in last year’s remarkably peaceful election and transition of power, which resulted in Muhammadu Buhari’s presidency. An admirably succinct final chapter ties together several themes, including the negative effects of oil dependence; the egregious corruption within the Nigerian elite, which continues to hinder democratic rule and economic growth; and the evolving role of religion as a source of political and social cleavages."
5,Electoral Violence in Sub-Saharan Africa: Causes and Consequences,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2015-12-11/electoral-violence-sub-saharan-africa-causes-and-consequences,Electoral Violence in Sub-Saharan Africa: Causes and Consequences,"In late 2007, a contested presidential election in Kenya resulted in widespread violence, leading to 1,300 deaths and rendering homeless hundreds of thousands of Kenyans. The fighting made headlines, but it was not particularly novel: since 1990, more than half the multiparty elections held in sub-Saharan Africa have resulted in violence. Burchard examines the Kenyan case, along with episodes in Liberia and Senegal. In all three countries, pro-government and opposition groups both took part in the violence, but state forces were more likely to do so in a premeditated, strategic manner. Burchard shows that when elections are followed by chaos and bloodshed, it negatively affects turnout the next time around and serves to undermine public support for democracy. Burchard notes that postelection violence is far less common in a handful of democratic countries in the region that have relatively strong and independent democratic institutions, such as news media, electoral commissions, and judiciaries."
6,Made in Africa: Industrial Policy in Ethiopia,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2015-12-11/made-africa-industrial-policy-ethiopia,Made in Africa: Industrial Policy in Ethiopia,"Ethiopia has enjoyed double-digit economic growth rates for the last decade, establishing itself as the fastest-growing economy in Africa. As a senior official in the ruling regime for the last few decades, Oqubay has been one of the architects of its economic policy, and his book offers interesting insights into the leadership’s ideas and motivations, especially when it comes to industry and exports. However, most of Ethiopia’s recent growth has come in the agricultural and service sectors, and so Oqubay’s argument that industrialization represents the key to economic success seems misplaced and mostly aspirational. Oqubay wants Ethiopia to adopt a development model heavily influenced by East Asian countries such as South Korea, where governments have been able to stimulate growth by exerting tight control over the economy. He repeatedly criticizes what he calls “mainstream” economics for its emphasis on comparative advantage and market-based incentives, insisting instead on the benefits of top-down planning. At the core of his analysis are well-informed case studies of Ethiopia’s cement, floriculture, and leather industries, in which he offers surprisingly frank assessments of the managerial and economic constraints these subsectors face."

Many of them are still alive. The entries range from the obvious (Chinese President Xi Jinping, the dissident Wei Jingsheng) to the surprising (Wang Shuo, a transgressive novelist; Jet Li, the martial arts movie star; Rebiya Kadeer, the exiled Uighur advocate; Lai Changxing, the smuggling kingpin) and include leaders in politics, business, science, sports, and the arts. Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan are also represented (by, among others, former Taiwanese President Lee Teng-hui, the pop singer Teresa Teng, the movie director Wong Kar-wai, and the gambling czar Stanley Ho). Some important names are inevitably omitted—for example, the dissident artist Ai Weiwei. The entries are not merely life chronologies. They probe their subjects’ personalities and accomplishments, providing a sense of how each subject fits into the complex mosaic of Chinese society. The result is a readable, often entertaining portrait of an era that is still in the process of becoming."
8,"Deng Xiaoping’s Long War: The Military Conflict Between China and Vietnam, 1979–1991",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2015-12-11/deng-xiaopings-long-war-military-conflict-between-china-and,"Deng Xiaoping’s Long War: The Military Conflict Between China and Vietnam, 1979–1991","This skillful study shows that, in several ways, China’s brief, ill-fated invasion of Vietnam in 1979 was more significant than scholars have generally understood. It was the prelude to over a decade of low-level military conflict that lasted until 1991, sapping Vietnam’s ability to dominate Cambodia and Thailand. It positioned China firmly in the U.S. camp in the Cold War, cutting off Moscow’s opportunity to make itself a Southeast Asian power. Especially valuable is the book’s detailed account of the Chinese military’s logistical weaknesses, tactical errors, and command incompetence during the invasion. This poor performance enabled Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping to unite the Chinese Communist Party around his strategy of economic development first and military modernization second, with the latter to include streamlining and a shift away from traditional close-combat ground warfare tactics and toward higher-tech combined-arms operations. The month-long initial incursion also did great damage to Vietnam, which the Vietnamese have not forgotten. Chinese-Vietnamese relations may warm and cool, but this book reminds readers of the reasons why fundamental distrust persists on both sides."
9,The Barefoot Lawyer: A Blind Man’s Fight for Justice and Freedom in China,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2015-12-11/barefoot-lawyer-blind-mans-fight-justice-and-freedom-china,The Barefoot Lawyer: A Blind Man’s Fight for Justice and Freedom in China,"Chen is the blind human rights activist whose dramatic 2012 escape from house arrest to refuge in the U.S. embassy in Beijing led to tense negotiations over his fate between U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Chinese authorities and then to Chen’s exile in the United States. His stubborn resistance to in-justices in rural China—especially the government’s coercive enforcement of the one-child policy—led him and his family to be targeted by local Communist Party officials with detentions, beatings, a sham trial, imprisonment, and extralegal house arrest, to the point where his mistreatment became an international scandal. The book culminates in the gripping story of his nighttime escape from his village, right under the noses of dozens of guards. Chen is an outsize personality, but he comes from an ordinary village, so his memoir provides insight into the factors that make relations between local officials and peasants so explosive throughout China. It also illuminates some of the ways in which foreign pressure can help ameliorate human rights abuses, even in this era of Chinese assertiveness."
10,Karachi: Ordered Disorder and the Struggle for the City,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2015-12-11/karachi-ordered-disorder-and-struggle-city,Karachi: Ordered Disorder and the Struggle for the City,"Karachi is one of the world’s most violent cities, beset by strikes, riots, bombings, arsons, murders, massacres, and mutilations carried out by a staggering array of actors, including student and labor movements, political parties, criminal gangs, sectarian extremists, and the Pakistani Taliban. Sporadic attempts by government forces to reclaim control have only intensified the violence. But Gayer patiently uncovers the latent patterns of order that allow the city to function and to produce one-quarter of Pakistan’s GDP and handle 95 percent of its foreign trade. Violence often takes place within factions that are disciplining their own dissidents or represents a phase of negotiations among rival parties—negotiations that also include episodes of cooperation. Communities segregate themselves, and people learn to interpret street scenes to avoid trouble. The abundance of interest groups and conflicts makes the story sometimes hard to follow, but the larger message is clear: the sheer number of violent organizations and the tenuous balance of power among them—what the author calls “armed consociationalism”—prevents the city from spinning out of control. Gayer’s own evidence, however, shows that the situation is steadily getting worse."
11,"Blood, Dreams, and Gold: The Changing Face of Burma",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2015-12-11/blood-dreams-and-gold-changing-face-burma,"Blood, Dreams, and Gold: The Changing Face of Burma","Cockett, a former correspondent for The Economist, has traveled to every corner of Myanmar (also known as Burma) to uncover the roots of its troubled condition. The Burmans, the majority ethnic group (who are mostly Buddhist), live on the country’s central plain. They are surrounded by a horseshoe-shaped ring of “hill tribes,” many of which are Christian and which are classified into 135 officially recognized ethnic groups. This picture is further complicated by the legacies of the British colonial period, when the country experienced an influx of Hindus and Muslims from various parts of India, as well as Chinese merchants, Iraqi Jews, and others seeking commercial opportunities. Faced with so much ethnic and religious diversity, postindependence military regimes tried to “purify” the country through assimilationist education and language policies, exclusionary citizenship laws, and a military-dominated economic model, all of which have only exacerbated divisions. Cockett’s lucid analysis of these complexities makes clear his affection for the country. But he evinces little hope that the current quasi-military regime or the opposition can overcome these conflicts and make Myanmar anything more than a “stunted democracy.”"
12,The Invitation-Only Zone: The True Story of North Korea’s Abduction Project,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2015-12-11/invitation-only-zone-true-story-north-koreas-abduction-project,The Invitation-Only Zone: The True Story of North Korea’s Abduction Project,"In dealing with North Korea, Japanese policymakers focus as much on what they call “the abductee issue” as on the issue of nuclear weapons. In the 1970s and 1980s, North Korean agents seized an unknown number—perhaps hundreds—of Japanese citizens from beaches and city streets, smuggling them to North Korea to serve as language instructors, potential spies, and in other roles that apparently were not well thought out. Some may have been killed so that their identities could be assumed by North Korean agents. Boynton vividly describes the bizarre experiences of some of the victims, who were forced to feign loyalty to the North Korean system—and in some cases actually came to support the regime of Kim Il Sung. So far, Pyongyang has allowed five abductees to return to Japan with their children and has identified eight who it claims have died of natural causes. This accounting has done little to satisfy Japanese public opinion, which is anxious about Japan’s vulnerability to its neighbor’s unpredictable acts. For its part, North Korea points out that during World War II, Japan abducted a far greater number of Korean citizens to serve in mines, on farms, and in factories, and many of them died or remain unaccounted for."
13,The China Boom: Why China Will Not Rule the World,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2015-12-11/china-boom-why-china-will-not-rule-world,The China Boom: Why China Will Not Rule the World,"Hung masterfully integrates wide-ranging historical and economic details to make sense of China’s development and relations with the global economy. During the late 1950s and early 1960s, Chinese leader Mao Zedong unwittingly laid the basis for Chinese capitalism by carrying out forced industrialization on the backs of the peasants. His successors pursued a version of the classic East Asian state-led capitalist model by fostering the development of export-dependent coastal urban economies and massive state enterprises while tolerating relative stagnation in the rural hinterlands. That strategy generated rapid economic growth but also corrupt and repressive local governance, an overreliance on exports, overinvestment in infrastructure, and an explosion of debt. Hung argues, controversially but convincingly, that there is no unique China model that developing countries can follow in order to avoid the flaws of capitalism or close the wealth gap with the developed world. Moreover, the boom of the book’s title is destined to peter out, potentially with disastrous consequences, unless the regime cedes more economic and political power to peasants and workers. Meanwhile, China has integrated its interests so tightly with those of the United States that its rise supports, rather than threatens, the U.S.-led global order."
14,Desert Diplomat: Inside Saudi Arabia Following 9/11,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2015-12-11/desert-diplomat-inside-saudi-arabia-following-911,Desert Diplomat: Inside Saudi Arabia Following 9/11,"Jordan served for two years as U.S. ambassador to Saudi Arabia following 9/11, a period that covered the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq. In this readable chronicle, he demonstrates good instincts and a fair measure of modesty. In his assessments of his superiors, U.S. President George W. Bush and Secretary of State Colin Powell come out well; Vice President Dick Cheney and Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld do not. The Saudis offered consistent support to the U.S. effort to topple Saddam Hussein but parted company with Washington when the postinvasion power vacuum in Iraq allowed Iran to move in. He details Riyadh’s unhappiness with the failure of the Bush administration to take seriously Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah’s 2002 Arab-Israeli peace initiative. He also notes that when the United States abandoned Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in the wake of protests against his rule in 2011, Saudi rulers understandably wondered whether the same thing might happen to them someday. Jordan details the strains in the U.S.-Saudi relationship but suggests the countries are doomed to a strategic partnership."
15,Islamic State: The Digital Caliphate,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2015-12-11/islamic-state-digital-caliphate,Islamic State: The Digital Caliphate,"Like most other informed observers, Atwan takes the threat posed by the Islamic State, or ISIS, very seriously. It is a highly sophisticated movement that exerts control over some six million people, boasts around 200,000 armed fighters, and last year sold around 80,000 barrels of oil every day, on average. Atwan oscillates between attributing ISIS’ emergence to the historical and recent blunders of Western powers and ascribing it to the poor judgment of local authorities,such as former Iraqi President Nouri al-Maliki. Atwan emphasizes that even many Muslims who could become victims of ISIS’ violence feel a grudging sympathy for the group. He also shows how through its mastery of digital communications, ISIS has mobilized Muslim youths all over the world. Atwan agrees with many other experts who see Saudi Arabia as the major source of support for jihadist movements; the irony is that from ISIS’ perspective, no prize could be greater than capturing the Saudi kingdom. Atwan argues that ISIS will not be defeated by a campaign of drones strikes and aerial bombardment but that putting Western boots on the ground would play right into the group’s hands."

Byman stresses the massive unpopularity of the United States among the world’s 1.6 billion Muslims and reviews the tools available to Washington for containing, if not defeating, jihadist networks. He focuses mainly on al Qaeda and its affiliates, devoting only one chapter to the Islamic State (also known as ISIS), which formed as a direct outgrowth of al Qaeda’s branch in Iraq. Jihadists of all stripes seek the restoration of the caliphate, but al Qaeda believes that ISIS jumped the gun in proclaiming its establishment in 2014. He argues that the core al Qaeda organization is not a spent force, and that Ayman al-Zawahiri, its current leader, is an effective successor to Osama bin Laden. Today, the group’s affiliates are more dynamic than the mothership; indeed, in some ways, the branches prop up the base. Despite the group’s loss of safe havens and the U.S. campaign of drone strikes against its leaders (of which Byman approves), al Qaeda has plenty of life left in it."
17,Captive Society: The Basij Militia and Social Control in Iran,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2015-12-11/captive-society-basij-militia-and-social-control-iran,Captive Society: The Basij Militia and Social Control in Iran,"As many as a third of Iranian adults may be affiliated with the Basij, a hard-line paramilitary group whose name translates as “mobilization.” The group formed during the Iran-Iraq War, and its purpose is to protect the Islamic Republic and its supreme leader. Resources began to flow in its direction especially after the reformist Mohammad Khatami won the presidency in 1997. Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who succeeded Khatami, was drawn from the Basij, and its members brutally defended his 2009 reelection, attacking the so-called Green Movement demonstrators who protested the election’s outcome. In Golkar’s skillful rendering, the Basij appears so vast that all Iranians can find some facet of themselves reflected in it. That said, its members hail primarily from the lower-middle classes and from rural areas. Its ranks include five million women and girls, nearly a million students, most of Iran’s regular police officers, and around 60 percent of all the civil servants in Iran. Belonging to the Basij often means enjoying access to jobs, cheap loans and housing, entrance to a university, and professional promotions. But the group is more feared than respected, and Golkar views it as a major impediment to any liberalization or democratization in the Islamic Republic."
18,After the American Century: The Ends of U.S. Culture in the Middle East,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2015-12-11/after-american-century-ends-us-culture-middle-east,After the American Century: The Ends of U.S. Culture in the Middle East,"Edwards plunges into the cultural lives of Cairo, Casablanca, and Tehran to illustrate the demise of one aspect of “the American century”: the outsize influence that U.S. popular culture exercised in the Middle East. He explores, among other things, Egyptian literature and political cartoons, Moroccan films and writings that deal with sexuality, the 2011 Iranian film A Separation, and the 2012 U.S. film Argo. Edwards’ wanderings produce many insights and readable treatments of a number of Middle Eastern texts and films. One persistent and problematic message risks undermining his efforts, however: in the Middle East, he writes, U.S. cultural products are so thoroughly recast in local vernaculars that they are rendered “untranslatable.” Edwards does not tell the reader much about those transformations because, it seems, any attempt to do so would be futile or distorting. That leaves the reader struggling to comprehend what, exactly, has replaced American popular culture. One unfortunate omission is the lack of any reference to Bassem Youssef, the satirist often referred to as “the Jon Stewart of Egypt,” whose wit is not lost in translation."

In the Soviet bureaucracy, Maisky stood out in many ways, especially as a Jew, and also as someone who was comparatively open-minded but nonetheless loyal and who survived Stalin’s purges—one of only two major Soviet ambassadors to do so. (Two weeks before Stalin died, in 1953, Maisky was arrested during the anti-Jewish witch-hunt that marked the dictator’s last years, but he was released two years later and fully rehabilitated.) During the 11 years he spent as a Soviet diplomat in London, Maisky kept a daily diary, a bold act in itself. Gorodetsky stumbled across it in 1993 while doing some research in Moscow. Almost every page sparkles with Maisky’s urbane wit. His portraits of the British elite are stunningly acute, and his depiction of London’s social, cultural, and political life radiates with color and a refined sensibility—especially the passages recorded during the German air siege of 1940. The diaries give readers a chance to meet a significant figure from this period who eschewed leaden Soviet-speak and candidly shared his doubts, convictions, fears, hopes, and frailties with honesty and clarity."

Cheterian deals with the most familiar aspects of the controversy: the insistence of Armenia and the Armenian diaspora that Turkey recognize the killing as genocide and the refusal of Turkish governments over the years not only to accept that designation but even to acknowledge the scale and nature of what happened. Cheterian also explores the killings’ intricate legacy in the Armenian communities that remain in Turkey and in others scattered across the world, revealing how the fight over 1915 continues to shape conflicts in Armenia, Azerbaijan, and the Middle East—and debates in the U.S. Congress. On an encouraging note, he reports that some among the younger generation of Turks are genuinely struggling to understand and come to terms with this episode in Turkish history."

Haslam takes seriously the task of tracing the history of Soviet espionage, to the extent that old and new sources allow. He acknowledges the significant obstacles that stand in the way, but his book fills in some large gaps. It covers the Soviets’ often bumbling early intelligence efforts in the years immediately following the 1917 Russian Revolution, as well as the increasingly professionalized operations of the 1920s and 1930s, when the Soviets “turned” Western leftists to the cause until Western intelligence agencies caught on and began dismantling the Soviet network after World War II. He reveals a striking divide between the 1930s and the post-Stalin years: in the earlier era, Westerners who allowed themselves to be recruited to the Soviet side were often idealistic; in the later years, such recruits were more frequently merely venal."

Street gangs are the entry point, and as in other countries, their roles extend beyond mere criminal activity. Stephenson plunges deeply into the world of Russian gangs, focusing on Tatarstan, a region where they have flourished. She examines neighborhood gangs of teenage street toughs; “entrepreneurial” Mafia-like groups that control business empires; and, in between those two types, vigilantes who commandeer territory, shaking down local businesses and managing illicit activities. She attributes the surge of such groups in the 1990s to the voids and stresses created by the collapse of the Soviet Union. But she also reveals the evolution that Russian gangs have undergone during the last 20 years. Many street gangs have gone from offering something akin to protective refuge to focusing on more predatory activities, and the more serious criminal groups have shifted from prosaic racketeering and extortion to big business. Stephenson’s analysis is informed by the fieldwork of others and by her own interviews with current and former gang members, law enforcement officials, teachers, school psychologists, and local residents."

He has a special gift for recognizing the complexities of Russia’s engagement with the outside world, including its problems and defects. He begins by examining the context of contemporary policy: the role of domestic politics, the mindsets of Russia’s leaders, and the challenges posed by the international setting. Next, he assesses Russia’s performance in four key areas—global governance, the post-Soviet space, the Asia-Pacific region, and relations with the West—skillfully capturing the subtleties of the Russian leadership’s perceptions and positions when dealing with the outside world and also identifying the limitations and maladaptations of the country’s rulers. Finally, arguing that Russian foreign policy need not continue on its current course, he finishes with a thoughtful exploration of four possible alternative futures: “soft authoritarianism,” producing a foreign policy much like the current one; “hard authoritarianism,” leading to a more aggressive foreign policy but limited by constrained resources; “regime fracturing,” which would result in an erratic and highly unpredictable foreign policy; and “second-wave liberalism,” accompanied by a “Western orientation” and a more modern concept of what it means to be a great power."

For that history, readers can find no better place to turn than Plokhy’s new book. Plokhy begins all the way back in the fifth century BC, exploring the origins of the Slavs, and then gives equal weight to each subsequent phase of Ukraine’s story. He moves through each stage of the territory’s history as it fell under the rule of a succession of groups and political entities: the Vikings, the Byzantine Empire, the Mongols, the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, the Russian empire, the Soviet Union, and finally an independent Ukraine. Plokhy demonstrates a remarkable ability to untwist the dozens of trends, forces, and players marauding across this land and to take their measure in clear, compact segments. Ukraine’s history has always been contested, and never more intensely than now. Plokhy navigates the subject with grace and aplomb."

It contains stark, frank revelations regarding the post-9/11 ambitions of the U.S. national security bureaucracy. The two authors, senior officials at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security writing in their personal capacities, describe their agency’s redefinition of its mission vis-à-vis Mexico, moving away from simply securing a “line in the sand” and toward a deep penetration into Mexican territory. Under this expansive security paradigm, the DHS’ power, budget, and personnel have vastly increased. At the same time, the DHS has embraced more efficient “risk-based” methodologies that save time and money and promise a better balance between security and economic goals. Looking to the future, the authors foresee a “North American Century,” not with European-style shared sovereignty but rather with “trinational conceptions and tripartite associations.” The authors also wish to expand the security perimeter beyond Mexico, writing that “the long-term benefits of integrating Central America (and the island countries of the Caribbean) economically into North America are self-evident.”"
27,Cuban Studies 43,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2015-12-10/cuban-studies-43,Cuban Studies 43,"A new editorial team led by Alejandro de la Fuente draws on scholarship from Cuba and around the world to make this multidisciplinary journal a must-read for those looking beyond the headlines for a deeper understanding of the rapid changes taking place on the island. This issue of the journal focuses on demographic trends. In one article, Sergio Díaz-Briquets warns of an alarming population decline, the consequence of low fertility rates and out-migration. He accuses Havana of “mortgaging the future for immediate short-term economic gain” by encouraging young Cubans to emigrate and send remittances back home. Alejandro Portes and Aaron Puhrmann document sharp divides within the Cuban American enclaves of South Florida, between the wealthier and better-networked arrivals of the 1960s and 1970s and the less well-educated, more isolated—and much less successful—Cuban immigrants who came later. These more recent immigrants have produced a resurgent transnationalism, as many continue to engage with their families in Cuba. Still unclear, however, is whether those ties across the Straits of Florida will generate greater political openness in Cuba or whether the Cuban regime’s labor-exporting policies will promote a Vietnamese model of a hybrid economy under a single-party state."

The well-edited and accessible articles by leading U.S. and Colombian experts collected in this timely volume recognize those achievements but also maintain a sharp focus on the country’s remaining challenges: government violations of human rights, systemic corruption and organized crime, weak institutions, rural poverty, stark economic inequality, and nearly five million internally displaced persons. Negotiations that aim to end the decades-long war between the government and the guerillas of the farc (Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia)—talks heroically pursued by Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos—appear close to achieving resolution. But even if the parties reach a deal, Colombia will struggle to find the right balance between justice and peacemaking, between accountability and reconciliation. Readers of this volume will be ably guided through these topics and others, including Colombian foreign policy and the contributions and sins of U.S. policy and diplomacy in Colombia."
29,Strangers on Familiar Soil: Rediscovering the Chile-California Connection,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2015-12-10/strangers-familiar-soil-rediscovering-chile-california-connection,Strangers on Familiar Soil: Rediscovering the Chile-California Connection,"This wonderful book weaves together captivating anecdotes with analysis of environmental interactions and economic exchanges between California and Chile in order to reimagine the making of the Americas. The two places are linked by the American Cordillera, a chain of mountain ranges that includes the Sierra Nevada in California and the Andes in Chile; a common mild, dry, Mediterranean-type climate; and the Pacific Ocean. They have repeatedly remade each other’s histories. The California Gold Rush depended on Chilean ships and wood, Chilean wheat flour, and Chilean mercury. In turn, the Monterey pine tree, native to California, has refashioned the forests and landscapes of southern Chile. More recently, technical assistance partnerships among agronomists and corporate joint ventures have connected California’s and Chile’s respective fruit and wine industries. But Melillo is no romantic: his emphasis on transnational linkages includes the antagonisms and tensions that these encounters have generated among the people and ecosystems in both places. He recounts ugly instances of bigotry in California against Chilean immigrants, and he frets over the inherent dangers of monoculture and environmental globalization. On a personal note, as a former Peace Corps volunteer in Chile who now resides in California, I am indebted to Melillo for so masterfully authenticating the many connections between the two places that I had long intuited."

That changed forever when the union undertook an ill-advised intervention in monetary policy by creating the euro and then sticking with it through the financial crisis. Those decisions have had disastrous consequences for public trust in and support for the EU, which have plummeted in the years since. Most subsequent commentary has focused on the technocratic details of eu monetary policy and banking regulation. Cramme and Hobolt bring together some leading academic minds to puzzle through deeper questions. Is the EU politically sustainable? If so, in what form? What are the implications of the euro for democratic participation? In general, the contributors are skeptical that the EU will be able to put itself back together again in anything like its previous form, but they remain equally skeptical of radical reform. Anyone interested in the future of Europe should read this book."

Pantucci convincingly rebuts common explanations for the rise of militant Islam among British youth, such as economic exclusion and the influence of hard-line clerics. He points instead to three linked factors: identity, grievance, and mobilization. Jihad offers a way to for young immigrants (or the children of immigrants) to blend their various ethnic identities. These young people oppose British nationalism yet do not really feel that they belong to any other country. Fighting for an internationalist cause thus offers a way to answer the question, “Who am I?” This opens the door for grievances: the more Western countries become involved militarily in the Islamic world, particularly in ways that kill civilians, the more young British Muslims see defending their foreign coreligionists as a legitimate goal. The third factor is the existence of a mobilizing network of recruiters, today usually functioning online. In the United Kingdom, these recruiters espouse violent versions of either Salafi or Deobandi ideologies."

Then German soccer collapsed. For a decade, the German team—which unified just after that World Cup victory, along with East and West Germany—did not proceed past the global quarterfinals, and in 2000, it was ejected from the European championships after having scored just one point. This book describes the comeback of German soccer, culminating in the team’s victory at the 2014 World Cup. Honigstein, one of the world’s top soccer columnists, describes how the German establishment came together to invest in soccer facilities, establish a national system of youth academies, reconstruct scouting and coaching systems, install state-of-the-art training equipment, and develop a cohesive national team spirit. The details of this story will thrill soccer lovers, but there is also an underlying lesson—a very European one. Excellence in sports, as in the arts, education, business, and many other things, is a social accomplishment. It is achieved through sensible institutional design and not, as many believe (especially in the United States), simply by getting incentives right and letting talented individuals do their thing."

It is supremely erudite, eminently readable, and politically incorrect. The topic is the Spanish empire of the late sixteenth century, which Thomas argues was the first global (and thus the first modern) empire. He focuses on the gruesome nature of Spanish conquests in Mexico, South America, and the Philippines, during which individuals of dubious, often criminal backgrounds used brutal means (including enslavement) to realize not just the Spanish royal will but also their own goals. Those goals—seeking treasure, establishing independent kingdoms, and even, in one case, conquering China—sometimes crossed over into the fantastical, if not the outright insane. At the heart of it all sat Philip II, reading every document, holding the empire together through personal rule, and authorizing massive expenditures that ultimately bankrupted his kingdom. But then comes Thomas’ politically incorrect punch line: despite these lurid details, he defends the civilizing mission of the Spanish empire as ultimately progressive. This seems odd, but in an era when Western armies are engaged in their own civilizing missions throughout the world, Westerners would do well to study what their ancestors did when faced with similar challenges."

This exceptionally engaging book records her impressions of Europe from the distinctive perspective of someone who was brought up in India and also spent a significant portion of her career in China. Most interesting are her street-level insights into cultural difference. To someone accustomed to the logistical chaos and conversational informality of Asian streets, the manicured boulevards and airy stores of Brussels appear cold and dead. Attuned to an informal economy, she investigates the traditional cheese industry in the Italian region of Emilia-Romagna and discovers that around 100,000 nearly invisible Asian workers support it. (The title of the book’s British edition is Punjabi Parmesan.) Aiyar, who is accustomed to living in a riotously multicultural and multilingual country, questions Belgium’s stated commitment to those forms of diversity. Not all of her points ring true—for example, she exaggerates Chinese influence in Europe—but this book will offer any reader fresh insights into not-so-old Europe."

Kinzelbach exposes this as a myth. Employing remarkable interviews and archival and historical research, she builds a convincing case that this quiet approach is not only useless but also counterproductive. She shows how the Chinese cleverly employ closed-door sessions with the EU not only to deflect Western criticism but also to train rising officials in how to counter it in public. Kinzelbach faults the EU's decentralized structure and its analysts’ naiveté for Europeans’ misplaced faith in private dialogue. But this seems insufficiently cynical: she assumes that eu states actually want to prioritize an effective human rights policy toward China and are willing to pay a price for it. But perhaps they simply seek to deflect their own domestic political pressure to play tough with China. Still, this is not just the best study of Western human rights policy toward China and of informal human rights dialogue in print; it is also one of the best microanalyses of a sensitive contemporary policy issue that I have ever read."
36,By the People: Rebuilding Liberty Without Permission,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2015-12-14/people-rebuilding-liberty-without-permission,By the People: Rebuilding Liberty Without Permission,"For readers seeking to understand the antiestablishment rage fueling the right-wing populism of today’s Republican Party, Murray’s book serves as an indispensable introduction. In articulating a conservative vision of limited government, Murray emphasizes how entrenched interest groups have exploited weaknesses in legislative, regulatory, and electoral processes to produce a state that has grown inexorably larger, less efficient, and more corrupt. He strengthens the force of his polemic by pointing mostly to examples of Republican corruption and Republican surrenders to special interests. Murray argues that the rot has gone so far that it cannot be halted by conventional means, and he recommends a strategy of selective civil disobedience to limit the reach and power of the regulatory state. As the country finds itself gripped by a wave of transformational economic change, Murray seeks a path for domestic reform that can appeal to the political center as well as Tea Party populists. (His book briefly but approvingly cites some of my own writings on these themes.) Few American writers understand the forces that drive Republican discontent as well as Murray; this book is the best available guide to the next stage of U.S. politics."

They are also responsible for a large and growing proportion of federal spending. And given the seemingly relentless rise of health-care costs and the growing number of Americans who reach the age of 65 every year (and thus qualify for Medicare), the ability of the federal government to maintain defense and discretionary spending and the overall strength of the U.S. economy increasingly depend on the effective management of these programs. The editors of this outstanding collection have brought together many of the country’s most knowledgeable and influential experts on health care to reflect on where Medicare and Medicaid stand at their half-century mark. Health-care policy is as difficult to master as it is vital to the country’s future; there is no better place for politicians and students to begin their education on the subject than this judiciously assembled, thoughtfully edited, and lucidly written collection."
38,Between the World and Me,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2015-12-14/between-world-and-me,Between the World and Me,"In one of the most riveting and heartfelt books to appear in some time, Coates reflects on the state of black America in the form of a letter to his adolescent son. For Coates, the American dream is so grounded in racism that the “people who need to believe they are white” today are almost as deeply involved in the destruction of black bodies and black lives as their forebears were. Coates’ writing is powered by his outrage at the recent string of police shootings of young black men, which have gone largely unpunished, and intensified by his visceral fear for the safety of his own son in a country where such incidents are widespread. The book achieves a level of clarity and eloquence reminiscent of Ralph Ellison’s classic Invisible Man; it is compelling even when it isn’t entirely convincing. Coates may be a better polemicist than analyst, but the perspective he brings to American life is one that no responsible citizen or serious scholar can safely ignore."
39,The Gay Revolution: The Story of the Struggle,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2015-12-14/gay-revolution-story-struggle,The Gay Revolution: The Story of the Struggle,"The struggles for the rights of racial minorities, women, and LGBT people have transformed American life over the last two generations. The LGBT movement’s success has been perhaps the most surprising of the three. Both the civil rights and the feminist movements have deep roots in the nineteenth and even eighteenth centuries. The quest for LGBT equality is a much more recent development, and in contrast to the civil rights and feminist movements, its history is not well known and many of its most important leaders remain obscure. Faderman’s well-organized and comprehensive history focuses on the work of courageous leaders who belonged to a despised minority but nevertheless managed to challenge and ultimately defeat some of the strongest taboos in American society. Faderman is less interested in the story of what led Americans to hear and appreciate the arguments of lgbt leaders. That story remains to be told. In the meantime, anyone who wants to understand the gay rights movement and the profound impact it has had on the United States would do well to consult this eminently readable and well-researched book."

Rivlin offers a survey of the long, slow recovery. His account suffers from the absence of an analytic overview of New Orleans’ economic structures and prospects before and after Katrina. Nevertheless, a clear and somewhat disturbing picture of the initial recovery does emerge. Government at all levels proved ineffective, and local government was hopelessly corrupt. The wealthy, mostly white business interests that had long dominated New Orleans achieved most, but not all, of their goals. The African American majority, mostly poor but also containing a strong middle class, suffered disproportionately but organized effectively enough to prevent the outcomes it feared most. The foundations, urban planners, and upper-middle-class reformers who flocked to the city spent large sums of money but, Rivlin argues, had relatively little impact. Divided, disorganized, and still desperately poor after the storm, New Orleans seems once again to have successfully frustrated the efforts of outsiders to reform or reconstruct it."

Galvin, who recently passed away, served during two problematic periods in the history of the U.S. Army (the late 1940s and the post-Vietnam years) and two very successful ones (the early 1960s, when the army modernized, and the 1980s, when it was rebuilt). He held two combatant commands: Southern Command, which he headed during a critical time, when insurgencies were spreading throughout Latin America, and European Command, where he was the last Cold War–era supreme allied commander of NATO forces in Europe. A son of New England, he began and ended his academic career there, serving as the dean of the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy after leaving military service. A writer as well as a battlefield commander—Galvin wrote, among other things, a very good book on the Minutemen—he was the epitome of the soldier-scholar, a type less common in today’s U.S. military, although his protégé, David Petraeus, is of that mold. Galvin’s memoir (introduced by an admiring Petraeus) is a characteristically modest, wry, and thoughtful account not only of leadership but also of the rise, fall, and rise again of U.S. military power in the second half of the twentieth century. And it is, as well, a reminder that now and again, one comes across generals with the stuff of greatness in them."
42,Hattin,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2015-12-14/hattin,Hattin,"In 1187, the Muslim sultan Saladin defeated the crusader armies at the Battle of Hattin, restoring Muslim rule over Jerusalem and other places that the European Christian forces had captured during the preceding century. Yet Saladin’s victory did not lead to the complete expulsion of Christians from the region, and in fact, it prompted further bouts of crusading. In this book, which is part of Oxford’s Great Battles series, France reveals how divisions among the Christian leadership led to the slaughter at Hattin and explains how the battle has shaped the legacy of the Crusades. For one thing, many medieval Europeans came to see Saladin as a noble and worthy opponent—in some respects more honorable than the men he defeated. In more recent times, Saladin’s image has been appropriated by Arab and Muslim leaders such as Saddam Hussein, who have claimed to emulate the sultan’s leadership."

Rahe puts the Spartans at center stage, providing a vivid description of their society and politics: militaristic in ethos but cautious in diplomacy. The Spartans played a crucial role in forging the Hellenic alliance that repelled the Persian invaders, and their bravery and military talents were critical to such victories as the famous defense of the pass at Thermopylae in 480 BC. Rahe sets the story in a complicated geopolitical context, with a large cast of characters connected through a series of shifting alliances. But his relaxed, even jaunty style and his thorough analysis sustain the narrative and hold the reader’s attention. And his appreciation of the practicalities of ancient warfare—from the challenge of managing large numbers of horses to the difficulty of maneuvering triremes, the chief naval vessels of the era—adds credibility to his accounts of the key battles."

As the title suggests, Pike does not let Japanese Emperor Hirohito off the hook for the battles fought in his name. Pike sets the fighting firmly in the context of the regional tensions that had been developing for some time before any combat took place, not least as a result of the Japanese invasion of China in 1937. The book covers all the major campaigns and battles of the war, from Pearl Harbor to Hiroshima, but also pays close attention to often overlooked topics, such as the Burma Campaign (which pitted the British and the Chinese against Indian, Japanese, and Thai forces) and the Chinese resistance to Japan. Pike’s analysis is careful but never dry, and he pens lively portraits of his main characters. The book covers so much, and at such great length, that the publisher apparently was not able to include maps, illustrations, notes, or appendixes. Readers must visit a website for that material. This is regrettable: it would have been better to split the book into two volumes."

For example, authoritarian systems tend to be bolder than democracies; for that reason, authoritarian leaders are more prone to strategic error. In line with other scholars who have recently examined this issue, Talmadge distinguishes between authoritarians who are able to focus unremittingly on the enemy and those who must watch their backs at home. If political leaders are fearful of military coups, they tend to interfere with command structures to prevent the rise of charismatic and ambitious generals. The resulting disruption and uncertainty undermine military performance, especially during complex operations. Talmadge backs up her compelling thesis with well-chosen, interesting case studies. During the Iran-Iraq War, she explains, regimes in both countries worried about coups. Iraq’s Saddam Hussein was simply paranoid by nature; Iranian leaders feared that the military still housed loyalists to the shah, whom they had only recently overthrown. Both countries’ armies performed better when political leaders put aside such concerns and concentrated on the war."

At various points in U.S. history, military leaders and civilian defense officials have relied on that fact to resist the integration of African Americans, gays, and women into the infantry, arguing that their presence would disrupt the bonding process. In each case, the demands of maintaining an all-volunteer army, along with rapid changes in social mores, rendered that resistance futile: all three groups are now part of the American fighting force. MacKenzie confronts the main arguments offered by opponents of allowing women to fight, including women’s supposed physical weakness and emotionalism and the concern that sexual tension between male and female fighters would lead to problems. She does not deny that the presence of women will change the character of the infantry but argues that it might be a net benefit. This is a vigorous contribution to the debate on women in the armed forces, although there is some tension between MacKenzie’s demonstration that women can cope perfectly well with the demands of combat and her distaste for the militarism and nationalism that she associates with preparations for combat."

In this capacity, he befriended a number of young reporters struggling under increasing pressure from the government of President Paul Kagame. By the end of the book, they are all either in jail, in hiding, exiled—or working for Kagame’s government. Sundaram’s heartfelt chronicle closely observes the mechanisms by which the Kagame regime has curtailed freedom of the press by co-opting, intimidating, arresting, and even committing violence against independent journalists. Sundaram complains bitterly about the heroic reputation that Kagame has earned in the West for his efforts to rebuild the country after the 1994 genocide; in Sundaram’s view, Kagame actually runs a police state intent on limiting even the most timid forms of opposition to its rule at the same time as it receives substantial foreign aid. Despite an appendix detailing the government’s harsh treatment of several dozen Rwandan journalists over the last two decades, the book relies too heavily on a mood of brutality and doom rather than a careful analysis of the regime and its methods. Still, Sundaram has written an unsettling account of journalists under fire."

The United States is involved in two major ones: the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which involves 12 countries in the Asia-Pacific region that agreed to terms late last year but have yet to ratify the deal, and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, which Washington is hashing out with the 28 members of the EU and hopes to complete later this year. This book provides a reasoned analysis of the TTIP in mid-negotiation, critically examining arguments made by its advocates and its critics, most of whom are in Europe. The authors’ sympathies lie mainly with the detractors, although they find the claims of both sides exaggerated. They are especially doubtful that the deal will add 0.5 percent to Europe’s GDP by 2027, as its proponents predict, or that it will establish new “gold standard” trading rules for the rest of the world. They are troubled by the way that international trade has taken priority over other worthy objectives and allege that a successful TTIP negotiation will actually impinge on democratic decision-making in the future."

Its central message is that the concept of the competitive market as a socially optimal arrangement, as conveyed by the typical college-level economics textbook, is not merely too reductive but actually fundamentally wrong. The profit motives that usefully lead businesses to compete in pricing and innovation also lead them to appeal to their customers’ baser instincts and even to deceive people into making purchases; the snake oil salesmen of a century ago are still around today, just in different forms. The authors argue that the risk comes from the fact that misleading tactics often work and that they can become systematic. Economists and others need to be aware of this as they frame policy goals."

But in the current era, these activities have become increasingly global in character and scope, significantly eroding the taxation of income and capital gains in a race to the bottom accelerated by the rise of tax havens and by countries that arrange their tax rules to make themselves attractive to internationally mobile capital, a phenomenon known as tax competition.

Radelet challenges this perception, at least as far as economic development and democratization are concerned. He reckons that the past quarter century has seen the greatest advances in material well-being in the history of mankind, whether measured in terms of real income, infant mortality, devastation from disease, or a host of other indicators. During the same period, democratic governance has made significant advances all over the world, and Radelet believes the two trends are related. Between 1993 and 2011, some 955 million people rose out of extreme poverty, as defined by the World Bank. Admittedly, China’s tremendous economic boom accounted for 60 percent of those. Still, that means that close to 400 million people escaped destitution elsewhere. Radelet does not want anyone to become complacent; there is still much poverty to be eliminated. But he wants to acknowledge, build on, and learn from the substantial successes that have been achieved. Challenges lie ahead, especially in the form of civil conflicts over scarce resources and risks posed by climate change. Radelet, however, believes that good political leadership and international cooperation can overcome such obstacles to further prosperity."
52,"The Global Village Myth: Distance, War, and the Limits of Power",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2015-12-14/global-village-myth-distance-war-and-limits-power,"The Global Village Myth: Distance, War, and the Limits of Power","This challenging book takes aim at “globalist” thinking. Porter argues that Western security elites increasingly believe that globalization and technological changes have made the world smaller but also more threatening. Porter thinks that phenomenon is more imagined than real, and much of his book is an effort to show that territoriality, geography, and state power still matter. He reminds readers that even in the age of drones and cyberwarfare, it is still difficult for most countries or nonstate groups to project power across great distances. Porter is eager to puncture the “myth” of globalism because he sees it as the core idea behind U.S. military activism and hegemonic ambitions. After all, if threats to the homeland can come from anywhere, the entire world must become the United States’ zone of operation. For Porter, such thinking opens the door to what the historian Charles Beard called “perpetual war for perpetual peace.” Porter may be right, but even if the world is not a tightly integrated village, hiding behind borders no longer seems to be an option."
53,Theorizing the Responsibility to Protect,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2015-12-14/theorizing-responsibility-protect,Theorizing the Responsibility to Protect,"In 2005, the UN General Assembly unanimously adopted the doctrine of “the responsibility to protect” (R2P), requiring governments to safeguard their citizens against mass atrocities and authorizing the international community to act if they do not. In theory, R2P redefines long-standing norms of sovereignty and nonintervention. In practice, however, R2P remains an elusive goal, as revealed by this collection of essays, the best account yet of the philosophical and practical difficulties that bedevil R2P. Gareth Evans, one of the doctrine’s intellectual architects, contributes an incisive account of the origins and rise of the R2P idea and argues that despite setbacks, it is slowly emerging as a guiding principle. Edward Newman contends that the legitimacy of R2P ultimately hinges on the procedures used to authorize international action. Jean-Marc Coicaud looks at R2P through the lens of the recent crises in Gaza, Syria, and Ukraine, showing how the norm can be hijacked for cynical purposes. And Jonathan Graubart offers the most far-reaching critique, arguing that R2P merely provides great powers with a new justification for pursuing traditional military interventions."
54,Emotional Diplomacy: Official Emotion on the International Stage,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2015-12-10/emotional-diplomacy-official-emotion-international-stage,Emotional Diplomacy: Official Emotion on the International Stage,"In this pathbreaking study, Hall argues that emotionalism in diplomacy often serves a strategic purpose. Emotional outbursts can be useful for states seeking to reframe issues and project a new image to foreign audiences. In the 1995–96 crisis in the Taiwan Strait, China employed what Hall calls “the diplomacy of anger,” seeking to signal through provocative missile tests that Washington had crossed a boundary by allowing Taiwan’s president to visit the United States. Following the 9/11 attacks, China and Russia engaged in “the diplomacy of sympathy,” signaling tacit acceptance of the United States’ security predicament and suggesting new possibilities for great-power accommodation. Germany’s postwar “diplomacy of guilt” toward Israel has entailed not just statements of remorse but also costly reparations, through which Germany has rehabilitated its international image. Hall paints a fascinating picture of emotionalism as both diplomatic theater and rational calculation, but his book is inconclusive on its efficacy. Hall thinks that the “sincerity” of emotional gestures matters. Yet in politics, it’s often difficult to know exactly what to consider sincere."
55,"War, States, and Contention: A Comparative Historical Study",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2015-12-14/war-states-and-contention-comparative-historical-study,"War, States, and Contention: A Comparative Historical Study","Tarrow has spent most of his distinguished career exploring social movements and political conflict in western Europe. In this wide-ranging historical survey, he examines how “contentious politics”—draft riots, worker strikes, ethnic conflicts, civil rights movements, antiwar protests, and nationalist campaigns—have affected state building and war making in France, the United States, and Italy. During the French Revolution, domestic upheaval and war turned a “movement state” that proclaimed “the rights of man” into a military regime; French citizens regained their political rights only decades later, under the auspices of a centralized state. In the U.S. case, the Civil War strengthened the federal government and provided a catalyst for the abolitionist movement and the expansion of suffrage and citizenship rights. Italy entered World War I as a fragile liberal state, but faced with food shortages, labor strife, and antiwar protests, it succumbed to repressive military rule. In general, Tarrow sees the twentieth century as an era when foreign wars and geopolitical conflict tended to have a damaging impact on civil rights and citizenship, even in liberal democracies; the twenty-first century has seen a similar pattern, he argues, pointing to the consolidation of the “national-security state” and a semi-permanent war on terrorism. But his book is better at lamenting this development than explaining it."
56,The Guardians: The League of Nations and the Crisis of Empire,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/guardians-league-nations-and-crisis-empire,The Guardians: The League of Nations and the Crisis of Empire,"Since its founding at the end of World War I, the League of Nations has stood at the center of clashing narratives about the twentieth century. For liberals, the League embodies the noble yet unfulfilled vision of Wilsonian internationalism. Realists see its failure as a testament to the durability of power politics. Revisionist historians interpret the League as an institutional tool used by European powers to reconstruct and legitimate their empires. In this major new study, Pedersen portrays the League as an awkward and conflicted undertaking that nonetheless put in motion the decline of imperialism and the spread of national self-determination. Pedersen focuses on the League’s Permanent Mandates Commission, the system established in 1921 to manage the territories in Africa, the Middle East, and the Pacific that Germany, Austria-Hungary, and the Ottoman Empire lost in the war. Many saw the mandate system as a ploy to strengthen British imperial rule. But, as Pedersen writes, the League machinery unexpectedly provided a “platform” for internationalists, humanitarians, nationalists, and others who sought to expose the brutality of imperial rule. It would take decades and another world war to bring about a global system of sovereign independent states. But the League pointed the way."
57,Latin Americans Stand Up To Corruption,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/central-america-caribbean/2015-12-14/latin-americans-stand-corruption,Latin Americans Stand Up To Corruption,"Just a few years ago, Latin America was on a roll. Its economies, riding on the back of the Chinese juggernaut, were flourishing. A boom in commodity prices and huge volumes of foreign direct investment in agriculture and natural resources generated a golden decade. Ambitious government programs began to reduce inequality. And relations with the United States, long a source of friction, were improving—even as they became less important to the region’s success."
58,Getting to Democracy,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/world/getting-democracy,Getting to Democracy,"Almost five years ago, mass protests swept the Egyptian autocrat Hosni Mubarak from power. Most local and foreign observers believed that Egypt was on the path to a democratic future; some even proclaimed that democracy had arrived. But the election of Mohamed Morsi and the Muslim Brotherhood’s Freedom and Justice Party led to polarization and violence, and in 2013, after more mass protests, General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi seized power in a military coup. Since then, Sisi’s regime has killed more than 1,000 civilians, imprisoned tens of thousands more, and cracked down on media and civil society."
59,The Transatlantic Data War,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2015-12-14/transatlantic-data-war,The Transatlantic Data War,"Last October, the European Court of Justice struck down the Safe Harbor agreement, a 15-year-old transatlantic arrangement that permitted U.S. companies to transfer data, such as people’s Google-search histories, outside the EU. In invalidating the agreement, the ECJ found that the blurry relationship between private-sector data collection and national security in the United States violates the privacy rights of EU citizens whose data travel overseas. The decision leaves U.S. technology companies with extensive international operations on shaky legal ground."
60,Not-So-Smart Sanctions,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/russian-federation/not-so-smart-sanctions,Not-So-Smart Sanctions,"After Russia seized Crimea from Ukraine in March 2014, the Obama administration responded with what has become the go-to foreign policy tool these days: targeted sanctions. The United States placed asset freezes and travel bans on more than one hundred people, mostly cronies of Russian President Vladimir Putin, and the EU targeted almost a hundred more. The amounts involved have been massive: Bank Rossiya, the Kremlin’s preferred bank, had $572 million frozen in the months after the sanctions were rolled out. Then, in July 2014, when Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 was shot down over eastern Ukraine allegedly by Russian-backed forces, Washington responded with more severe sanctions aimed at key sectors of the Russian economy, including arms manufacturers, banks, and state firms. In an effort to hit the Kremlin where it hurts, the measures inhibit financing and technology transfers to Russian oil and gas companies, which supply over half of state revenues."
61,Putin’s Power Play in Syria,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2015-12-14/putins-power-play-syria,Putin’s Power Play in Syria,"At the end of September, Russia began conducting air strikes in Syria, ostensibly to combat terrorist groups. The strikes constitute Russia’s biggest intervention in the Middle East in decades. Its unanticipated military foray into Syria has transformed the civil war there into a proxy U.S.-Russian conflict and has raised the stakes in the ongoing standoff between Moscow and Washington. It has also succeeded in diverting attention away from Russia’s destabilization of Ukraine, making it impossible for the West to continue to isolate the Kremlin. Russia is now a player in the Syrian crisis, and the United States will have to find a way to deal with it."
62,How China Sees Russia,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2015-12-14/how-china-sees-russia,How China Sees Russia,"At a time when Russian relations with the United States and western European countries are growing cold, the relatively warm ties between China and Russia have attracted renewed interest. Scholars and journalists in the West find themselves debating the nature of the Chinese-Russian partnership and wondering whether it will evolve into an alliance."
63,Prosperity Rising,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/united-states/prosperity-rising,Prosperity Rising,"Since the early 1990s, daily life in poor countries has been changing profoundly for the better: one billion people have escaped extreme poverty, average incomes have doubled, infant death rates have plummeted, millions more girls have enrolled in school, chronic hunger has been cut almost in half, deaths from malaria and other diseases have declined dramatically, democracy has spread far and wide, and the incidence of war—even with Syria and other conflicts—has fallen by half. This unprecedented progress goes way beyond China and India and has touched hundreds of millions of people in dozens of developing countries across the globe, from Mongolia to Mozambique, Bangladesh to Brazil."
64,When Congress Gets Mad,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/united-states/when-congress-gets-mad,When Congress Gets Mad,"The scholar Edward Corwin famously described the separation of powers between the executive and the legislative branches set out in the U.S. Constitution as “an invitation to struggle for the privilege of directing American foreign policy.” With different parties controlling different branches of government, partisan politics tends to intensify this struggle, and the consequences can be ugly. These days, for example, hardly a week seems to go by without vicious sniping between the Obama administration and Republicans in Congress over one issue or another—from China to Russia, Iran to Syria, Cuba to Israel. And on most issues, process as well as discourse has broken down, with each side openly trying to thwart or bypass the other."
65,Time to Get Tough on Tehran,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/iran/2015-12-14/time-get-tough-tehran,Time to Get Tough on Tehran,"The nuclear deal that the United States and five other great powers signed with Iran in July 2015 is the final product of a decadelong effort at arms control. That effort included sanctions in an attempt to impede Iran’s quest for a nuclear weapons capability. The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA, ranks as one of the most deficient arms control agreements in history. But U.S. President Barack Obama has pledged to spend the remainder of his tenure fending off congressional pressures to adjust its terms."
66,Brazil’s Antipoverty Breakthrough,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/brazil/brazils-antipoverty-breakthrough,Brazil’s Antipoverty Breakthrough,"In recent years, as public anxiety over growing inequality has intensified, policymakers and academics have started scrambling for some increasingly extreme solutions. India, for example, has launched massive programs to provide the poor with food and jobs, and the French economist Thomas Piketty has famously proposed a redistributive global wealth tax."
67,Big Ben,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/2015-12-14/big-ben,Big Ben,"The biggest revelation offered by Ben Bernanke’s memoir of his time as chair of the U.S. Federal Reserve is just how much the public, the media, and especially elected officials have misunderstood the real lessons of the 2008 financial crisis and the subsequent Great Recession—events that defined Bernanke’s tenure, which began in 2006 and ended in 2014. Bernanke spends much of the book justifying what should be self-evident: that the risk of a second Great Depression called for precisely the sort of active monetary policy that he and his colleagues at the Fed pursued."
68,The European Disunion,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/european-disunion,The European Disunion,"The EU is under siege. The arrival of hundreds of thousands of refugees from Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria has tested the single-border principle at the core of the union. The ongoing financial crisis in Greece has strained the single currency. The United Kingdom will soon hold a referendum on whether or not to exit the EU. The survival of an EU with a single border, a single currency, and a stable membership appears less likely than ever before."
69,How to Spread the Wealth,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/world/how-spread-wealth,How to Spread the Wealth,"As growth slows in mature economies across the developed world, economic inequality has reached new heights. Defined in terms of the shares of disposable income of households across the economic spectrum, adjusted for varying needs, inequality today in the United States is significantly higher than it was a generation ago. The same is true in the United Kingdom, and even less laissez-faire countries, such as Germany and Sweden, have seen inequality increase dramatically."
70,Equality and American Democracy,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/united-states/equality-and-american-democracy,Equality and American Democracy,"Since the trend toward rising economic inequality in the United States became apparent in the 1990s, scholars and commentators have heatedly debated its causes and consequences. What has been less evident is a vigorous positive discussion about what equality means and how it might be pursued."
71,How to Create a Society of Equals,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/world/how-create-society-equals,How to Create a Society of Equals,"There has been much discussion of rising economic inequality in the developed world recently, along with a generalized sense that the problem has grown to intolerable proportions. But at the same time, there has been little movement to address the situation; instead, there is tacit acceptance of many specific forms of inequality and the processes that produce it. The result is widespread discontent together with practical passivity."
72,Inequality and Globalization,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/world/inequality-and-globalization,Inequality and Globalization,"When it comes to wealth and income, people tend to compare themselves to the people they see around them rather than to those who live on the other side of the world. The average Frenchman, for example, probably does not care how many Chinese exceed his own standard of living, but that Frenchman surely would pay attention if he started lagging behind his fellow citizens. Yet when thinking about inequality, it also makes sense to approach the world as a single community: accounting, for example, not only for the differences in living standards within France but also for those between rich French people and poor Chinese (and poor French and rich Chinese)."
73,Inequality and Modernization,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/world/inequality-and-modernization,Inequality and Modernization,"During the past century, economic inequality in the developed world has traced a massive U-shaped curve—starting high, curving downward, then curving sharply back up again. In 1915, the richest one percent of Americans earned roughly 18 percent of all national income. Their share plummeted in the 1930s and remained below ten percent through the 1970s, but by 2007, it had risen to 24 percent. Looking at household wealth rather than income, the rise of inequality has been even greater, with the share owned by the top 0.1 percent increasing to 22 percent from nine percent three decades ago. In 2011, the top one percent of U.S. households controlled 40 percent of the nation’s entire wealth. And while the U.S. case may be extreme, it is far from unique: all but a few of the countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development for which data are available experienced rising income inequality (before taxes and transfers) during the period from 1980 to 2009."
74,Obama’s Way,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/united-states/obamas-way,Obama’s Way,"On January 28, 2009, barely a week into his presidency, Barack Obama met with the U.S. military’s top generals and admirals on their own turf, inside “the tank,” the Joint Chiefs of Staff’s conference room on the second floor of the Pentagon. A senior official recalled the new president as “remarkably confident—composed, relaxed, but also deferential, not trying to act too much the commander in chief.” Obama walked around the room, introducing himself to everyone; he thanked them and the entire armed forces for their service and sacrifice; then he sat down for a freewheeling discussion of the world’s challenges, region by region, crisis by crisis. He was “the man in full,” the official said, fluent on every issue, but more than that—a surprise to the officers, who had been leery of this young, inexperienced Democrat—he displayed a deep streak of realism."

The Democrats won overwhelming majorities in the House and the Senate, which they used to pass Johnson’s Great Society legislation. Republicans, meanwhile, were at one another’s throats, having endured the most divisive campaign in modern political history. Goldwater had managed to win the Republican presidential nomination over the impassioned opposition of moderate and progressive Republicans, who at the time may well have constituted a majority of the party’s members. Moderates blamed Goldwater’s right-wing views for the defection of millions of Republican voters."
1,Clear and Present Safety,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/north-america/clear-and-present-safety,Clear and Present Safety,"Last August, the Republican presidential contender Mitt Romney performed what has become a quadrennial rite of passage in American presidential politics: he delivered a speech to the annual convention of the Veterans of Foreign Wars. His message was rooted in another grand American tradition: hyping foreign threats to the United States. It is “wishful thinking,” Romney declared, “that the world is becoming a safer place. The opposite is true. Consider simply the jihadists, a near-nuclear Iran, a turbulent Middle East, an unstable Pakistan, a delusional North Korea, an assertive Russia, and an emerging global power called China. No, the world is not becoming safer.”"
2,The Case for Space,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/space/2012-02-15/case-space,The Case for Space,"In 2010, U.S. President Barack Obama articulated his vision for the future of American space exploration, which included an eventual manned mission to Mars. Such an endeavor would surely cost hundreds of billions of dollars -- maybe even $1 trillion. Whatever the amount, it would be an expensive undertaking. In the past, only three motivations have led societies to spend that kind of capital on ambitious, speculative projects: the celebration of a divine or royal power, the search for profit, and war. Examples of praising power at great expense include the pyramids in Egypt, the vast terra-cotta army buried along with the first emperor of China, and the Taj Mahal in India. Seeking riches in the New World, the monarchs of Iberia funded the great voyages of Christopher Columbus and Ferdinand Magellan. And military incentives spurred the building of the Great Wall of China, which helped keep the Mongols at bay, and the Manhattan Project, whose scientists conceived, designed, and built the first atomic bomb."
3,Debating Europe,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/europe/2012-03-01/debating-europe,Debating Europe,"Andrew Moravcsik’s review of David Marquand’s book The End of the West (“Recent Books on International Relations,” September/October 2011) characterized Marquand as both a political turncoat and a weak-kneed, inconsistent thinker who has reversed his position on European integration. These are damaging accusations, and both are manifestly untrue. Marquand has always been a pillar of the United Kingdom’s democratic left; he stuck with the Social Democratic Party from start to finish, and he has never wavered in his advocacy of European integration."
4,Reports Of The Bear’s Death Are Greatly Exaggerated,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/russian-federation/reports-bears-death-are-greatly-exaggerated,Reports Of The Bear’s Death Are Greatly Exaggerated,"Nicholas Eberstadt (“The Dying Bear,” November/December 2011) is surely correct that a rapidly depopulating Russia would be confronted with a number of essentially irresolvable economic, military, and political problems. However, data from Russia’s Federal State Statistics Service suggest that over the last decade, Russia’s demographic indicators have in fact been getting better. Moreover, this improvement has intensified since the onset of the 2008 global financial crisis, confounding a number of Western experts who predicted that the downturn would have a similar eªect within Russia to that of the country’s debt default in 1998, when fertility plummeted and mortality skyrocketed."

Following the transition to majority rule in the 1990s, official policy was to forget that experience, now viewed as a regrettable consequence of the apartheid regime’s deplorable policies. This remarkable collection of essays by members of the South African security establishment has the objective of legitimating anew their expertise in counterinsurgency, in order to draw lessons for the contemporary mission of the South African army. It turns out that the strategies and techniques that the apartheid-era army developed in, say, Namibia in the late 1970s remain highly instructive for peacekeeping in places such as the contemporary Democratic Republic of the Congo. The authors also cannot help but remark that the counterinsurgency doctrines developed by the American and British militaries in Afghanistan and Iraq bear no small resemblance to the South African army’s earlier efforts.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."
8,An Inconvenient Youth: Julius Malema and the ‘New’ ANC,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2012-03-01/inconvenient-youth-julius-malema-and-new-anc,An Inconvenient Youth: Julius Malema and the ‘New’ ANC,"Close to two decades of majority rule in South Africa have improved the welfare of its black citizens. But the country’s level of economic inequality remains among the highest in the world; worse, wealth correlates uncomfortably with race, with whites controlling a hugely disproportionate share of assets and income. Forde’s biography of Julius Malema, a rising populist firebrand, demonstrates that resentment of this racial inequality has long festered among the black population, providing ambitious politicians with a temptingly easy path to political notoriety. Forde portrays Malema as the most skillful of these politicians and documents his rapid rise to power, from a childhood of poverty through the ranks of the African National Congress, where he served as president of the Youth League -- until the party suspended him from that post last year after he was convicted of hate speech against whites. Forde portrays the ANC as an increasingly flabby organization that is losing the legitimacy necessary to prevent the racialist demagoguery in which Malema dabbles. At the same time, her finely grained portrait of Malema makes clear that he is more interested in power than in redressing historical inequities.

9,From Protest to Parties: Party-Building and Democratization in Africa,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2012-03-01/protest-parties-party-building-and-democratization-africa,From Protest to Parties: Party-Building and Democratization in Africa,"This book examines contemporary politics in Kenya, Zambia, and Zimbabwe to understand why some opposition parties manage to wrest power away from long-standing autocratic rulers, as in Zambia in 1991, and others do not, as in Kenya in 1992. LeBas’ ingenious answer is that autocratic regimes establish the instruments of their own demise by creating relatively strong corporate actors, such as trade unions, to buttress their own rule. Indeed, trade unions created by African regimes have sometimes turned against their patrons and become the core of effective opposition parties. LeBas shows how a highly contentious transition to democracy can help strengthen political parties but also tends to increase the possibility of political violence -- as it has in both Kenya and Zimbabwe. The book’s analysis of party competition in these three countries is astute and rings true. But additional evidence from other political transitions is needed to determine whether LeBas’ findings are applicable to other low-income countries.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

But Rwanda’s present circumstances have been largely neglected. This edited volume is perhaps the first serious attempt to assess contemporary politics in Rwanda over the course of the last decade. The portrait that emerges is decidedly mixed. The country boasts what is perhaps the least corrupt civil service in Africa, a disciplined and sometimes visionary instrument of economic and social development. On the other hand, the book argues, the government of President Paul Kagame displays some dogmatically authoritarian tendencies, which might ultimately hamper economic and political development. The book’s best chapters show the extent to which the government has instrumentalized the memory of the genocide to stifle dissent and international criticism, sometimes with considerable cynicism. One theme that emerges from the book is that the regime’s judicial system for dealing with the crimes of the 1990s, although innovative and sometimes genuinely participatory, has been manipulated to intimidate Kagame’s political opponents, while the regime still refuses to address the considerable human rights violations its own agents committed during that era.

11,Africa’s Odious Debts: How Foreign Loans and Capital Flight Bled a Continent,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2012-03-01/africas-odious-debts-how-foreign-loans-and-capital-flight-bled,Africa’s Odious Debts: How Foreign Loans and Capital Flight Bled a Continent,"The numbers are startling. From 1970 to 2008, the combined foreign debt of African countries rose from less than $50 billion to more than $200 billion in constant dollars. During the same time, capital flight from the 33 sub-Saharan African countries for which decent data exists totaled $735 billion. In this arresting analysis, two economists show that those numbers are closely related. A large proportion of the publicly contracted debt was siphoned off by individuals, often in key policymaking roles, and then expatriated for private gain. Ndikumana and Boyce estimate that as a result, Africa, the world’s poorest region, is actually a net creditor to the rest of the world. Much of this lively and readable book is concerned with the combination of sheer incompetence, delusion, corruption, and regulatory failure that led Western banks and financial institutions to lend money to the region, even though it would obviously never be repaid. The book makes a compelling case that because of the way it was created, this “odious” debt should not be repaid today. Of course, the more important practical issue for Africa is how to bring about the repatriation of all that squandered capital. Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."
12,Social Networks and Japanese Democracy: The Beneficial Impact of Interpersonal Communication,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2012-03-01/social-networks-and-japanese-democracy-beneficial-impact,Social Networks and Japanese Democracy: The Beneficial Impact of Interpersonal Communication,"Ikeda and Richey aim to determine whether Confucian values in Japan -- such as obedience to hierarchy and a preference for social harmony over debate -- dampen the positive effects of civic engagement on Japanese democracy. Analyzing data from surveys of Japanese voters conducted between 2001 and 2005, they find that the legacy of Confucianism generally does not prevent civic engagement (defined as participation in informal networks) from producing positive democratic effects in Japan. However, they also concede that Japan is less influenced by Confucian values than other Asian countries, where those values might interfere more with democratic governance. The book contains ten short chapters, many of which present regression tables using the same or similar independent variables. The authors, however, have chosen to write a new chapter for every new set of dependent variables -- political engagement, political knowledge, policy preferences, and political tolerance, among others. And each chapter reviews the existing scholarly literature, methods, variables, and regression results. As a consequence, the book is short but nonetheless repetitive.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."
13,Eclipse: Living in the Shadow of China’s Economic Dominance,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2012-03-01/eclipse-living-shadow-chinas-economic-dominance,Eclipse: Living in the Shadow of China’s Economic Dominance,"Subramanian, an economist, argues that if China grows at roughly the same rate as other countries that managed to narrow the gap with richer competitors in the past, and if China’s foreign trade increases at the rate some theories predict for countries of its economic size, then China will soon become the world’s largest economy and its currency will become an international reserve currency. Those are two big ifs, but the author does not seem particularly concerned with establishing their likelihood. He is more interested in applying formulas derived from economic history to quantify the size and fix the date of the economic power transition that will happen -- as soon as this decade, he says -- if current trends continue. Words such as “eclipse,” “shadow,” and “dominance” lend a bracing urgency to that prediction, as do some nightmare scenarios scattered throughout the discussion. Yet such rhetoric contradicts the non-zero-sum principles of economics, as well as Subramanian’s own advice that the United States should continue to cooperate with China. It remains unclear how the growth of China’s prosperity and the convertibility of its currency -- both longtime U.S. policy goals -- will threaten American interests.

14,Diplomacy: A Singapore Experience,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2012-03-01/diplomacy-singapore-experience,Diplomacy: A Singapore Experience,"Jayakumar, a former UN ambassador and former foreign minister for Singapore, originally prepared this series of case studies to help train his country’s young foreign service officers. The language is prim by American standards, and the explicit lessons are fairly obvious: know your brief; be prepared. But the honest, meaty narratives offer insights into the strategic goals and diplomatic means of one of the world’s most skillful foreign ministries. Singaporean diplomats use energy, charm, and expertise to magnify their influence in the UN and steer regional organizations in preferred directions. Singapore often stands up to bigger powers -- China, the United Kingdom, the United States -- to make sure no one takes it for granted. But Singapore takes care to manage its relations and avoid permanent damage. In dealing with prickly neighbors, such as Indonesia and Malaysia, the latter of which controls much of Singapore’s water supply, Singapore relies on both international law and personal relationships. Jayakumar argues that other countries’ nationalist media often pose obstacles to the rational settlement of issues. Nevertheless, Singapore’s diplomats seem able to defend their country’s interests all over the world without further inflaming opposition at home or abroad.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."
15,China’s Thought Management,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2012-03-01/chinas-thought-management,China’s Thought Management,"Looking beneath the superficial diversity of Chinese media, Brady and her contributors expose the continuing role of the Chinese Communist Party’s Propaganda Department, officially renamed in English the Publicity Department in 1998. A softer style -- “market-friendly, scientific, high tech, and politics lite” -- has replaced Maoist indoctrination. But the news is still controlled: scandals are spun and quickly buried, and feel-good symbols of progress are eagerly promoted. Officials in government and the military memorize carefully crafted formulas that help them stay in line with party policy, and the general public imbibes a steady flow of happy talk that keeps it disengaged from politics. Case studies show how modern persuasion techniques maintain the high level of public support for the government, the ruling party’s firm grip on the military, and the popularity of the current system even among Chinese émigrés. But the party has enjoyed less success in rebranding China internationally as modern and even democratic. Focusing on top-down propaganda strategies, the book does not assess the possible threats posed to thought management by the growing Chinese blogosphere or the emerging cadre of intrepid, truth-seeking Chinese journalists.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

This survey by a network of local-studies scholars is an indispensable guide to the administrative system below the central level. China’s constitution provides for three subnational tiers: province, county, and township. But the authors identify nine distinct governmental units, divided into five levels. Today, much of the action in economic development and social policy takes place in municipalities (shi), of which there are about 600, positioned at three different bureaucratic ranks, depending on their size. The key driver of the municipalities’ emergence has been urbanization, which created the need for city centers to administer their increasingly interdependent rural surroundings. A great deal of power and responsibility have been delegated to the shi level, along with substantial fiscal independence and the right to experiment with new policies. Still, the center retains ultimate control through its power over officials’ careers. Ambitious local officials provide much of China’s dynamism but also contribute to environmental problems, corruption, local protectionism, and economic overheating.

Pirates in these waters range from opportunistic amateurs to criminal syndicates. Cargo boats are the most frequently attacked, usually to be stripped of their cargoes but sometimes to be reused or sold. Local fishermen are robbed of their nets, engines, and catches, chiefly by other fishermen who are impoverished because overfishing has depleted fish populations. Local navies and coast guards are underequipped and sometimes corrupt. A lack of international coordination across complex maritime borders makes the job of securing the straits and intricate coastlines even more difficult. Private security companies have filled the gap to some extent, but they are virtually unregulated. Liss’ wide-ranging and detailed fieldwork validates her argument that piracy is an expression of deeper issues, ranging from coastal poverty to inadequate maritime regulatory regimes to the devastation of the ocean environment.

The country’s pliant news media have fostered an image of the king as a loving national father and a Buddhist quasi deity while building a cult of personality around members of the royal family. A network of conservative elites enforces a “magic circle of silence” around the court with a lese-majesty law that punishes offenders with prison sentences of up to 15 years. While popular religion venerates the king’s image as a source of prosperity, the monarch’s policy of village self-sufficiency and his sponsored development programs have only served to legitimate growing economic inequality. The monarchy positions itself as a defender of democracy, but the king allowed himself to be used as an alternative source of legitimacy by those who opposed a freely elected leader during the 2006 coup. Instead of helping consolidate national unity, the contributors argue, the royal cult increasingly polarizes Thai politics.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

Subjects usually given separate chapters in books about Turkey -- for example, Greek-Turkish relations and Turkey’s relationship with the EU and the United States -- are here woven into larger themes. Buttressed by many tables and figures and thus a bit ponderous at times, the book nevertheless offers many aperçus, including this one from Tocci and Walker: “Oddly, Turkey has quickly become more European, more democratic, more Islamic, and increasingly more nationalist simultaneously.” The book covers developments only prior to mid-2010, but it provides a useful background for taking the measure of issues that emerged later, such as Turkey’s changing relations with Israel and Syria.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

Individual chapters are devoted to the Iraq-related diplomacy of the Gulf states, Iran, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Syria, and Turkey. Concluding essays address Iraq in the context of Arab political reform and consider the U.S. role in Iraq. This book bears out the dictum, expressed some decades ago by an Arab diplomat but still valid, that in the Middle East, everything is linked to everything else. According to the editors, the United States should pursue “increased engagement with Iraq’s neighbors” and avoid heavy-handed involvement in the region, which could “undermine steps Iraqis and the neighbors need to take to reconcile.”Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

Bush to invade Iraq and overthrow Saddam Hussein in 2003. It is, equally, the story of the domestic American roots of the war. Bonin reconstructs the relationships between Chalabi and his now-famous (or infamous) neoconservative allies in the Bush White House and also examines the roles played by members of Congress (Democratic and Republican), academics, and journalists eager for a scoop. The dwindling few within the Beltway who maintained that Chalabi and his opposition movement enjoyed more support along the Potomac than the Euphrates proved to be correct, but only after the fact. Arrows of the Night is a first-rate case study of both Middle Eastern émigré politics and the American way of dealing with the Middle East."

Mohamed Bouazizi’s self-immolation ignited a chain reaction of challenges by hitherto seemingly acquiescent Arab societies to their authoritarian states. Some dominoes have fallen, others are atilt, and all have been shaken. This well-integrated account of a regionwide revolutionary year -- matching, if not exceeding, in importance Europe in 1848 or 1989 -- includes chapters on all but two Arab states (Lebanon and Sudan) and one on the Palestinians. Other chapters treat the reactions of the non-Arab Middle Eastern states -- Iran, Israel, and Turkey -- and those of China, the European Union, Russia, and, most of all, the United States. The contributors examine a wide range of factors that influenced the revolts: new media technologies, economic development, powerful militaries, democratization efforts, and ascendant Islamist parties. This volume weaves together those disparate elements, justifying its claim to constitute not just a string of separate entries but a genuine “collaborative work.” Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

Both were ill conceived and should have been avoided, Steele argues, but the Soviets showed a better ability to cut their losses than have the Americans (and their NATO allies) thus far. Steele sets out to debunk “thirteen myths about Afghanistan,” including the false notions that the Afghans have always defeated foreign armies, that the Soviet invasion was an unprovoked attack, that the Taliban are much more oppressive than previous regimes (an admittedly low bar), and that the Taliban do not have any popular support. Steele views the forces of Ahmad Shah Massoud, the anti-Taliban commander assassinated two days before 9/11, as no better than their opponents and offers a relatively positive appraisal of the period (1978–92) when Afghanistan was ruled by Afghan Communists, who, after all, did represent urban modernity. This eminently readable book is surely the most compelling revisionist history available of Afghanistan in the modern era."

Some saw conflicts over its leadership. Others blamed the institution itself. When the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the cornerstone of what became the World Bank Group, was founded in 1944, poor and war-torn countries had little access to private capital. Sixty years later, however, private-sector financial flows dwarfed public development assistance. “The time when middle-income countries depended on official assistance is thus past,” Jessica Einhorn, a former managing director of the World Bank wrote in these pages in 2006, “and the IBRD seems to be a dying institution.” In roundtable discussions and op-ed pages, the question was the same: Do we still need the World Bank?"

Roxburgh paints a more compelling portrait. He is sympathetic to what motivates Putin but critical of what Putin has become during his years in power. Roxburgh sees Putin’s obsession with restoring Russian strength and his prickly sensitivity to affronts as understandable but details with obvious distaste Putin’s cynical manipulation of power, his crass image management, and the unimaginable venality of the political elite on which he relies. What distinguishes this account and makes it engrossing, however, are not such familiar characterizations. Roxburgh, a journalist and public relations specialist, worked on a splendid BBC documentary about the Putin era, and he uses interviews with many of the key figures around Putin and with senior Western policymakers to recount in detail what was said and done as Russia lurched in one direction and the U.S.-Russian relationship lurched in another.

He also blames the administration of U.S. President George H. W. Bush for washing its hands of the crisis as it escalated from tension to widespread bloodletting in 1991–92. The Americans had initially embraced Slobodan Milosevic as a nasty but potentially Western-oriented economic reformer, largely out of an overarching dread of instability as communism collapsed across Eastern Europe. Glaurdic’s heavy emphasis on Serbian culpability for the tragedy that followed will not sit well with those who point their fingers in other directions. Nor will his exculpation of Germany’s policy of pushing for recognition of the defecting republics of Croatia and Slovenia, seen by many at the time as speeding Yugoslavia’s bloody demise. But Glaurdic’s critics will have to argue against a case built from a wider range of primary sources than anyone before him has used.

Robertson calls these “hybrid regimes,” environments where political competition exists but in unfair conditions. Robertson, after long and detailed study, focuses on the dynamics surrounding protest efforts in Russia, both on the street and in the factory. Vladimir Putin’s Russia is a model hybrid regime that sees contestation -- provided it is controlled by the state -- as functional and therefore desirable. The durability of such a regime depends on three factors: the coherence of opposition protests, the regime’s willingness to mobilize against opposition, and the level of unity among the political elite."
31,Leon Trotsky: A Revolutionary’s Life,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2012-03-01/leon-trotsky-revolutionarys-life,Leon Trotsky: A Revolutionary’s Life,"Not much new can be added to the story of a man who has been wondered over, lionized, and demonized many times before. The merit of this trim book is that it pulls together all the essentials of the life of Leon Trotsky and the revolution he so significantly shaped into a seamless, intelligent, and wonderfully accessible synopsis. This book is part of Yale’s series of biographies about noteworthy Jews, and its particular angle is to understand Trotsky as a Jew. On the one hand, he scorned the faith of his fathers: “I’m not a Jew; I’m a Marxist internationalist.” On the other hand, he showed a special sensitivity to Jewish suffering in a dying Russian empire and gravitated toward Jewish communities abroad. Such dichotomies defined the man. He was brilliant, compelling, even admirable as a young revolutionary, but brutal, arrogant, and obtuse once in power -- a contrast Rubenstein draws well. In many ways, his life was a metaphor for the Soviet revolution. “The tragedy at the heart of Leon Trotsky’s life,” Rubenstein writes, was that “it had begun with contagious idealism and ended entangled in a murderous dream.”Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."
32,Belarus: The Last European Dictatorship,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2012-03-01/belarus-last-european-dictatorship,Belarus: The Last European Dictatorship,"Belarus sits like a large ellipsis at the center of Europe, an authoritarian puzzle to much of the outside world, worrying to its immediate neighbors, and a vexatious ally to Russia. But is it, Wilson asks, even “a proper country?” To answer that question, he takes the reader through a compressed mass of history, from the tenth-century principality of Polatsk, through the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, to the late-nineteenth-century stirrings of a national Belarusian movement. A clear yes-or-no answer does not quite materialize from the maze of claims and counterclaims by historians. But the search leads Wilson to a second question: Why today’s authoritarianism? What explains the endurance of a throwback dictator like Aleksandr Lukashenko? As Wilson reveals in unvarnished detail, Europe’s last dictatorship did not emerge and then entrench itself by accident, nor does it represent a break from all the history that came before. Today’s repressive state might have been abetted by clumsy, miscalculating leaders in the wake of the Soviet Union’s collapse, and later by the weakness and feuding of the political opposition. But Lukashenko knew the soil he tilled.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."
33,Reaching Out: Cuba’s New Economy and the International Response,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2012-03-01/reaching-out-cubas-new-economy-and-international-response,Reaching Out: Cuba’s New Economy and the International Response,"Cuba has turned. It is recharting its future. Feinberg’s lucid, succinct report describes the Cuban economy’s self-defeating distortions and President Raúl Castro’s economic reforms, which are vague and short on speciﬁcs but authorize a market economy that many other Cuban leaders still distrust. Last April, the Cuban Communist Party adopted the reforms, and their signiﬁcance and reach have since become clear, as new markets for real estate and cars have emerged. Feinberg analyzes Cuba’s receptiveness to assistance from Canada and Europe and its “emerging-market strategy’’ of making economic deals with Brazil, China, Russia, and Venezuela. He also provides apt comparisons between Cuba and two developing countries, Nicaragua and Vietnam, that have engaged with the world market and the United States while still retaining a marked measure of independence. In a thought-provoking chapter, he argues that international ﬁnancial institutions should engage with Cuba, as should the U.S. government, thereby “nudging history forward in Cuba.” Ultimately, though, only Cubans can make their own history, even if they cannot make it just as they please -- as Karl Marx would have told those Cubans who still claim to rule according to his vision.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

But is this success sustainable in a volatile global economy? And can Latin American countries accelerate their growth to East Asian levels? Those are the key questions tackled in these two complimentary, timely World Bank publications. Latin America and the Caribbean’s Long-Term Growth is unequivocal in its judgment: surging trade and investment ﬂows from China will not be enough to lift Latin America onto a sustainable high-growth path. The World Bank economists who authored the report ﬁnd little evidence that the China connection is fostering signiﬁcantly higher productivity -- the key to higher output and, hence, to better living standards. China can deliver a positive external shock, but only if Latin America progresses more rapidly with fundamental internal reforms: increased domestic savings, better education, more robust infrastructure, lower costs of doing business, and enhanced innovation capacity. The report does uncover some heartening news: growing evidence of technological modernization in agriculture in some countries and proﬁtable improvements in the processes used to transform raw materials into metals."
35,Guantánamo: An American History,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2012-03-01/guantanamo-american-history,Guantánamo: An American History,"With a broad, ambitious sweep, Hansen takes the reader through Cuban history from the Spanish conquest to the present day, highlighting the role of Guantánamo Bay, a large natural harbor on the island’s eastern tip, where the United States has maintained a naval base since 1903. Much of the book retreads well-worn ground on Cuban history and U.S.-Cuban relations. Hansen seeks to elevate the strategic and symbolic importance of the bay, but the evidence often undermines him. As Hansen concedes, the bay’s remote location reduced the U.S. Navy’s inﬂuence in political intrigues, compared with the role played by the American embassy in Havana, and during the Castro era, both the Cuban government and the U.S. military have cautiously avoided embroiling “Gitmo” in otherwise tense bilateral relations. Expounding at length, Hansen bitterly denounces the opportunistic use of the facility to hold Haitian migrants and, after 9/11, suspected terrorists. The book’s analysis of U.S. policies toward Cuba is ﬁltered through Hansen’s reductive view of the United States as a nation expansionist to its materialistic, racist core, where narrow self-interest regularly trumps professed idealism. But Hansen collects interesting anecdotes that, if separated from the book’s ideological riffs, would make for a colorful monograph.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."
36,International Mediation in Venezuela,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2012-03-01/international-mediation-venezuela,International Mediation in Venezuela,"Between 2002 and 2004, a period of dangerous political polarization in Venezuela, McCoy and Diez were members of a team from the Carter Center that negotiated between President Hugo Chávez and the Venezuelan opposition. The international mediation successfully channeled political energies away from potential violence and toward peaceful constitutional voting, although tensions remained after Chávez defeated a recall referendum and reaffirmed his executive powers in 2004. The book is smartly analytic, full of valuable lessons learned, and often self-critical; it is also a spirited defense of the Carter Center’s role in the standoff. Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter is lauded for his personal capacity to build trust with all parties, including Chávez. In contrast, the then secretary-general of the Organization of American States, César Gaviria, is portrayed as inﬂexible and distant. To justify the Carter Center’s endorsement of the recall vote, the authors detail the postelection scrutiny of the balloting procedures. They concede that as mediators, they should not have taken on the additional, delicate task of election monitoring. But their generally favorable commentary on Chávez’s leadership and social-transformation agenda and their repeated criticisms of his opponents will conﬁrm in some minds the oft-alleged pro-Chávez tilt of the center’s mission.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

As a tenacious leader of that opposition, Lagos built a strategy that eschewed violence, forged unity among quarreling factions, and lent courage to a fear-stricken population -- timeless lessons for pro-democracy movements ﬁghting authoritarian regimes everywhere. As minister of education and minister of public works, and later as president, from 2000 to 2006, Lagos improved social services for the poor -- while the lifelong socialist also discovered the virtues of free-trade agreements and public-private partnerships. Still, the right remains powerful in Chile, and a conservative businessman was elected president in 2010. Lagos applauds the student protesters now demanding better access to quality education as “the children of Chile’s democracy.” As president of a small, remote country, Lagos advocated a rules-based world order to protect weaker states living in the shadows of more powerful neighbors. Overall, Lagos emerges as a judicious and compassionate leader, a worthy torchbearer for the best of Chile’s political traditions.

39,Reagan and Thatcher: The Difficult Relationship,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2012-02-14/reagan-and-thatcher-difficult-relationship,Reagan and Thatcher: The Difficult Relationship,"Great historical figures generate their own myths, often deliberately. One task of the historian is to recapture, as much as possible, things as they actually were. Few modern politicians have generated more fictions than -- and few so deliberately as -- the American and British conservative revolutionaries of the 1980s, Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher. According to their overlapping myths, they were idealists who stood together for freedom, robust militaries, and a firm hand against terrorism. Yet looking back, the truth seems more complex and subtle. Thatcher’s inimitable Churchillian persona was the result of careful coaching by political professionals, and Reagan was far more pragmatic than most who invoke his name would have one believe. Aldous’ startling conclusion is that Reagan and Thatcher clashed repeatedly over issues such as the Falklands, Grenada, sanctions against the Soviets, the Strategic Defense Initiative, nuclear arms control and missile policy, the Middle East (especially Lebanon and Libya), and the West’s relationship with Mikhail Gorbachev -- all the while crafting an image of conservative unity for the media. In reality, the Anglo-American relationship during the 1980s was weaker in many ways than U.S. relations with France or Germany. This brilliant book reminds readers of the simple lesson that in diplomacy, interests often trump ideology -- and spin trumps both.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

On the plus side, as a widely published scholar of twentieth-century history, now retired from Georgetown and London’s Institute of Contemporary History, he brings formidable intelligence and historical erudition to the task of putting Europe’s current predicament into perspective. In contrast to commonplace conservative critics of Europe, Laqueur, when he cites Brooks Adams or Raymond Aron, Prince Klemens von Metternich or Jean Monnet, sounds as though he knows what he is talking about. On the negative side, this book repeats a set of one-sided criticisms about continental Europe typical of the Anglo-American right: it is militarily weak, demographically feeble, economically incompetent, fixated on human rights, overly critical of the United States, morally relativistic -- and, above all, too Muslim. Laqueur searches in vain for the causes of these alleged problems, obsessing about demographics and non-Christian immigration even while admitting they are not the primary factors. When Laqueur advances such arguments, the subtlety and factual basis so evident in his more general analysis desert him. Still, this jeremiad will surely be discussed widely.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

After a scholarly lifetime explaining French attitudes toward liberal values, free markets, and foreigners, the political scientist Kuisel is uniquely suited to the task. Many French find the Unites States’ inequality, materialism, populism, and global militarism deeply distasteful. Like so many things French, this response remains paradoxical: Americanization and anti-Americanization coexist together. The French flirt with transatlantic fashions and ideas, from free-market economics to California Cabernet. Some of it sticks, as Euro Disney, 1,000 McDonald’s, and many successful American TV shows attest. The French are more willing to use military force, support high technology, and oppose both communist and Islamist extremism than most other Europeans. Yet in the end, the French remain firmly wedded to views of democracy, family, work, and lifestyle that diverge from those  of Americans, and there is little sign of change. These views are particularly pronounced on the left, but even French business is ambivalent about the United States, seeking more freedom from regulation but remaining suspicious  of moving toward what is perceived as  an underregulated U.S. model. Kuisel unpacks all this, making this book required reading for anyone interested in relations between the world’s two oldest republics.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."
42,Thinking the Twentieth Century,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2012-03-01/thinking-twentieth-century,Thinking the Twentieth Century,"The late Judt was among the West’s leading public intellectuals and among the greatest intellectual historians of the West. His gift was to meld the two: his history captured the excitement of past intellectual debates, and his commentary was infused with the perspective of a master historian. The magnum opus he never wrote would have been a grand intellectual history placing in historical context the modern ideologies he studied -- socialism, nationalism, conservatism, liberalism, Marxism, Zionism, European federalism, religious fundamentalism -- and maintaining their relevance for future generations. The closest he came are the series of testimonial conversations contained in this book, conducted with the Yale historian Snyder during the final months of Judt’s battle with Lou Gehrig’s disease. The book highlights his status as a perpetual insider-outsider in France, the United Kingdom, and the United States, which seems to have afforded him a keen appreciation of the peculiar cultural and historical circumstances of each. Yet most moving for the reader are Judt’s fierce commitment to history as an indispensable key to understanding the present and his ability, even when speaking his final thoughts through a breathing tube, to express himself in clear, forthright language. Despite a sometimes meandering conversational form, the result is a volume filled with memorable insights that any educated person will enjoy."

Parmar’s most valuable insight is that although foundations have often failed in their stated objectives of promoting democracy and reducing poverty in developing countries, they have succeeded in creating networks of scholars and activists who have helped recast global intellectual life in the pragmatic American mold. These networks, along with the globalization of the American university and nongovernmental organization models, are among the most striking and important aspects of the post–World War II world, and Parmar does well to highlight their rise. But his book is too polemic to provide a full account of the phenomena it investigates; worse, Parmar seems to think that Americans could have easily reduced poverty and made the world a utopia had they only been less interested in their nefarious networking agenda.

It is also a demonstration of the continuing vitality of American culture. Jobs -- a vegan, antiestablishment, LSD-taking college dropout -- ultimately created a series of products that helped reshape American industry. Like many great entrepreneurs, Jobs had a personality and views that were quirky, eccentric, and sometimes off-putting. But American society proved flexible and hungry enough to enable Jobs and his insurgent band of obsessives and dreamers to find the financing and make the deals needed to put Macs, iPods, iPhones, and iPads into the hands of eager customers all over the world. The ability of Isaacson to write books that capture an age as well as a man makes him one of our best and most important biographers. Steve Jobs shows Isaacson at his best.

The two men were smiling; the caption read, “We had a frank and cordial conversation and then I bombed him.” Holbrooke’s untimely death in 2010 deprived the country of one of its finest, most inspiring, and at times most infuriating diplomats and public servants. It also motivated a group of his former colleagues, associates, and employees to write a spectacular series of essays retracing his life and career through the eyes of those who knew him best. Power’s essay alone is worth the price of the book; reflecting on her mentor, Power is affectionate, exasperated, and eloquent, catching Holbrooke at his most intense, most personal, and most effective. One of Holbrooke’s youngest protégés, E. Benjamin Skinner, writes about Holbrooke’s experiences in college journalism and as an intern at The New York Times and also considers the ways Holbrooke quietly integrated humanitarian concerns into his diplomatic missions. Aided by Holbrooke’s widow, Kati Marton, Chollet and Power have pulled together a collection of writings that reminds those who knew Holbrooke what they have lost and allows others to learn something about one of the great men of  our time.

Bush administration, first as national security adviser and then as secretary of state. In both form and substance, Acheson’s memoir of the Truman administration, Present at the Creation, serves as a model for Rice’s. Both Acheson and Rice served as secretary of state in administrations that were criticized for going to war as a result of policy errors (in Korea for Truman and in Iraq for Bush), and both turned the White House over to the opposing party after failures and difficulties abroad and at home. Acheson’s skillful memoir helped revise the historical verdict; today, the errors and misjudgments of the Truman years are largely forgotten, and such achievements as the Marshall Plan and the establishment of NATO dominate the historical memory. The Bush administration is unlikely to achieve so full a rehabilitation. Nevertheless, Rice’s rigorous and fair-minded accounting will likely help soften the historical verdict. Rice was one of the few principals of the Bush administration whose reputation stood higher in 2008 than in 2000; the crisp professionalism, love of country, and ability to see clearly and speak candidly on display in this memoir help explain why.

Sparrow is not the first scholar to argue that it was World War II, rather than the New Deal, that shaped the postwar consensus in support of a stronger, more active federal government. But this clearly written, concise, and yet comprehensive book makes the argument more forcefully and fully than others. The generation that fought World War II -- or that worked for victory on the home front -- lived under a more powerful and more intrusive federal government than any Americans before or since. With enormous force, the war imprinted on the “greatest generation” the importance of the subordination of individual interests to group well-being, of coordinating individual and corporate action under national authority, and of a common national purpose that overrode antagonisms of class and, to an extent, race. As members of that generation fade, so do the assumptions and habits -- good and bad -- they acquired in the war. The multifaceted consequences of this passing include everything from the rise of the Tea Party to the corrosion of ethics on Wall Street. Warfare State is a book that historians and students of contemporary American politics need to master; this is scholarship at its best."

He resigned in disgust at the bribes paid by arms manufacturers to senior party figures as the country modernized its military. Arms acquisition by governments is a reliable recipe for corruption: massive contracts for equipment that might never be used, all surrounded by the secretive, protective aura of national security. “Merchants of death” have long been blamed for feeding war frenzies and profiting from misery. But in Feinstein’s telling, the entire trade is a conspiracy between greedy businesses and kleptocratic elites, counterproductive for the selling nations (because the weapons often fall into the wrong hands) and for the buyers (because arms contracts use up scarce funds without doing much for security). One might argue that there are genuine defense needs that cannot be met any other way and that the trade is not always as distorted as Feinstein contends. But the book is not trying  to be balanced, and Feinstein makes his case with an impressive amount of detailed research and a gift for narrative that makes his findings hard to dismiss.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

But the East is now catching up. The end of the Cold War gave researchers access to Soviet archives and survivors and has made it possible to consider this epic struggle free from the ideological distortions of the communist years and also to describe some of the human stories behind the staggering statistics, as these two books do. Reid begins on the first day of the 1941 German siege of Leningrad (now Saint Petersburg), in which some 750,000 people died as Hitler sought to starve the population out of existence. During the first winter, in particular, the search for nutrition became desperate, descending even into cannibalism, which Reid describes in grisly detail. Meanwhile, the Communist Party and the secret police continued to manage the city in the spirit of prewar purges and propaganda, ready to blame defeatists and traitors for the people’s privations and never their own incompetence. Quoting from diaries, memoirs, and interviews, Reid brilliantly explodes Soviet-era myths and constructs a harrowing, unrelenting account that demonstrates how extreme human behavior can become in a struggle for survival."

The Germans went first. With Russia out of the war, extra German divisions were available. But they had little time and were anxious to strike before the Americans applied the full weight of their power. Germany’s spring offensive made rapid gains, pushing the Allies back, leading to British Field Marshal Douglas Haig’s famous order to his troops to continue fighting “with our backs to the wall,” from which Stevenson draws his title. But Germany and its army were exhausted. The offensive petered out, and the Germans were soon in retreat. Stevenson’s book is a masterful, lucid analysis that does not simply tell the tale. It also considers in detail the factors of technology, morale, supply, economics, and politics that contributed to Germany’s defeat. The tactics of the Allies were more imaginative, the blockade they imposed made life miserable for their enemies, and their leaders were more astute and attentive to the need for stability at home."

His thesis was a reworking of the ""end of ideology"" argument propounded in the 1950s by Daniel Bell and others, with an even more emphatic twist. ""What we may be witnessing,"" Fukuyama declared, ""is not just the end of the Cold War, or the passing of a particular period of postwar history, but the end of history as such: that is, the endpoint of mankind's ideological evolution and the universalization of Western liberal democracy as the final form of human government.""

It played an important role in modernizing Mexican agriculture and in the World Health Organization’s campaign against malaria in Asia and Latin America in the 1950s. But in the early 1960s, the biologist Rachel Carson and others revealed that DDT accumulated harmfully in birds and ﬁsh and could in fact pose risks to human health. The United States banned the domestic use of DDT in 1972, but it is still used in a number of poor countries. Kinkela emphasizes DDT’s part in the larger Cold War project of using American technology to improve the lives of poor people around the world, including the role of fertilizers and pesticides in making possible the “green revolution.” He presents DDT as a useful product with undesirable long-term ecological effects, requiring careful judgment about when to use it.

That is changing, slowly. Because global warming affects high latitudes more than low ones, melting sea ice (and improved technology) will increase access to the Arctic, both for transportation and for the exploitation of natural resources, which many experts believe are abundant in the region. Sea-travel distance from western Europe to Japan, the Korean Peninsula, and northeast China could be cut nearly in half if ships traveled through the Arctic Ocean north of Russia instead of via the Suez Canal and the Indian Ocean. In 2009, two German cargo ships traveled the Arctic route without relying on icebreaking escort vessels, which Russian ships normally use. This collection surveys the evolving possibilities of increased Arctic access and its implications for the ﬁve Arctic states: Canada, Denmark (which borders the Arctic by way of Greenland), Norway, Russia, and the United States.

Successes and Failures in Natural Resource Extraction,"In the 1980s and 1990s, a number of economists put forward the notion of a “resource curse.” According to this idea, a country rich in natural resources was condemned, at best, to lack development in tradable nonresource goods (due to having a too strong currency) and to possibly become a nonproductive rent-seeking society. At worse, the curse would lead to endemic corruption or even violent conﬂict over control of the dominant resource. Of the eight countries this book examines, only two -- Chile (copper) and Malaysia (rubber, then oil) -- have managed to convert their resource bases successfully into more diversiﬁed economies with sustainably rising standards of living. The only clear failure is Cameroon (oil), where the well-being of its citizens fell following the resource boom. The others -- Iran, Kazakhstan, Nigeria (all oil), Russia (mainly oil and gas), and Zambia (copper) -- have experienced mixed results. The editors provide an excellent analytic overview and suggest guidelines more likely to assure success, such as the creation and maintenance of overseas funds into which some of the proceeds from the exhaustible resource could be channeled. But the book also emphasizes the fact that there is no single way to manage resources and that for a country to be successful, its resource policies must take into account its particular circumstances.

Yet agriculture and manufacturing still receive disproportionate political attention. Jensen turns the spotlight on the more than 80 percent of U.S. workers employed in services, a diverse category that includes legal, accounting, architectural, educational, and medical services, as well as transportation and retail. He argues that many services are becoming increasingly tradable, meaning that some service jobs might move overseas. But tradable services typically require high levels of education and skill, so increased international trade in services should favor the American work force, which is relatively well educated and skilled. Jensen concludes that U.S. policy should aim to further liberalize trade in services to help American workers take advantage of the vast increase in infrastructure expenditures likely to occur in developing countries in the coming decades, which will create jobs that require advanced design and engineering skills. He also urges more attention to education at all ages to maintain American workers’ high level of skills.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."
56,Boomerang: Travels in the New Third World,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2012-03-01/boomerang-travels-new-third-world,Boomerang: Travels in the New Third World,"Lewis, the bestselling author of Liar’s Poker and The Big Short, has written a breezy, bottom-up account of the ongoing ﬁnancial crises in Iceland, Ireland, Greece, and two cities in debt-ridden California: ﬁnancially strapped San Jose and bankrupt Vallejo. The book is fun to read but also scary. Through his reporting and interviews, Lewis relates many amusing anecdotes about the roles of particular individuals and institutions and illuminates the social attitudes behind the naiveté and lack of discipline that laid the bases for the crises. Different cultures produced distinct responses to ﬁnancial adversity: Irish acceptance and passivity, Greek anger and hostility, and an Icelandic decision to elect female politicians who were less macho and more sensible than the men who had damaged the country’s economy. Californians, Lewis reports, have not yet reconciled their desire for public spending with their aversion to taxes. He also explores how traditionally staid German banks came to lend so much to overborrowers, such as the Greeks, not only producing large losses but also rendering themselves vulnerable to future crises. The irony is that the German government now must decide how much ﬁnancial assistance to give other members of the eurozone to help save Europe from a borrowing binge ﬁnanced by those very German banks."
57,Taking Liberties: The War on Terror and the Erosion of American Democracy; Power and Constraint: The Accountable Presidency After 9/11,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2012-03-01/taking-liberties-war-terror-and-erosion-american-democracy-power,Taking Liberties: The War on Terror and the Erosion of American Democracy; Power and Constraint: The Accountable Presidency After 9/11,"The unwinding of the Iraq war and the killing of Osama bin Laden have marked a symbolic end to the post-9/11 “war on terror.” What has not ended is the public debate over how the United States and other democracies can best square their commitment to civil liberties and the rule of law with protection against terrorism. Herman, the president of the American Civil Liberties Union, passionately calls for a rethinking of the costs and beneﬁts of the emergency presidential powers that were put in place after the 2001 terrorist attacks. She notes that Congress passed the Patriot Act with little or no meaningful deliberation. And to the surprise of some, the surveillance programs that the Obama administration has justified and pursued are not substantially different from those of its predecessor. Much of the book is a catalog of episodes in which Americans have been “blacklisted, watchlisted, . . . spied on, and gagged.” Post-9/11 measures relating to the “material support” of terrorism have infringed on First Amendment rights. New surveillance techniques have threatened the privacy rights protected by the Fourth Amendment. Herman believes that although it might be understandable that fear and uncertainty led authorities to privilege security over liberty, they overreacted in the wake of the attacks. In defending the United States, the government must also defend the Constitution."
58,Governance Without a State? Policies and Politics in Areas of Limited Statehood,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2012-03-01/governance-without-state-policies-and-politics-areas-limited,Governance Without a State? Policies and Politics in Areas of Limited Statehood,"Sovereign nation-states that can uphold the rule of law, enforce order at home, and abide by international rules and institutions are frequently touted as the building blocks of effective global governance. If fragile and failed states are the problem, nation-state building is the solution. But this important study led by Risse, a German political scientist, demonstrates that many parts of the world will not soon or easily be transformed into capable modern states. Starting with the assumption that “limited sovereignty” is here to stay, at least in many developing and postcolonial societies, the authors explore ways in which the international community can help such places develop effective and legitimate governance. Several authors explore the various ways in which “multilevel governance” has been organized, ranging from colonial administration to modern protectorates, such as Afghanistan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Kosovo. For readers who think the world is steadily moving toward the Westphalian ideal of a universal system of sovereign states, this book will be a revelation. For readers who despair at the chronic problem  of weak and failing states, this book contains intriguing ideas about alternative forms of stable governance.

59,Uniting States: Voluntary Union in World Politics,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2012-03-01/uniting-states-voluntary-union-world-politics,Uniting States: Voluntary Union in World Politics,"Scholars do not have good explanations for what causes states to voluntarily form political unions -- a rare but important phenomenon. The United States did so in 1789, and today’s European Union has come close. Realists expect states to tenaciously hold on to their sovereignty and are puzzled that states would ever try to unify. Liberals believe states are driven by the search for economic gains and democratic solidarity and are puzzled that political unions are so uncommon. In this provocative but carefully argued study, Parent makes the case that states create political unions only when they are imperiled by security threats. Unification is actually a type of “extreme alliance,” in which states of roughly equal power bind together for mutual protection. Parent finds only two instances of successful political unification -- the United States and Switzerland -- which he contrasts with the failed efforts of Sweden and Norway and with Simón Bolívar’s attempt to unite South America. The book succeeds in building a realist explanation of unification. But with so few cases of voluntary political union, it is not clear whether Parent’s theory is all that illuminating. Still, the book does generate a clear prediction in regard to Europe: without an intense, enduring, and widely shared threat, the core European states will fail to merge into a true union.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."
60,Humanity’s Law,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2012-03-01/humanitys-law,Humanity’s Law,"The human rights revolution of the last half century has begun to redefine the world’s understanding of the relationships among individuals, the state, and violence. This masterful treatise by Teitel, a law professor at New York Law School, offers one of the best explanations yet of the complex, shifting normative foundations of international law. Whereas the old international legal order emphasized “state security,” defined by borders, statehood, and territory, the emerging focus is on “human security”: the protection of persons and peoples. The result is what Teitel calls “humanity’s law,” a new discourse on violence and world politics that brings together and crystallizes a multitude of small but important shifts in international human rights law, the law of war, and international criminal justice. She chronicles the way these ideas have changed as courts, tribunals, advocacy groups, and international organizations have interpreted and extended the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the Geneva Conventions, and other enshrinements of principles about rights and responsibilities relating to war and justice. This book is an indispensable guide to understanding these intellectual transformations and their complicated implications for policymakers and the international community.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."
61,The Globalization of Animal Welfare,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2012-02-13/globalization-animal-welfare,The Globalization of Animal Welfare,"The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted in 1948, articulates the idea that it is wrong to exclude any member of the human species from the circle of moral concern. This enlightened vision was a tremendous advance over earlier, more restricted views about who matters morally; yet it still excludes a far larger number of beings who can both enjoy life and suffer: nonhuman animals. They, or at least those capable of feeling pain, which at a minimum includes all vertebrates, are also entitled to concern. Pain is pain, irrespective of the species of the being that experiences it."

More and more policymakers, congressional representatives, and members of the public are calling for the majority of U.S. forces to pull out as quickly as possible and for Washington to shift from an expensive counterinsurgency strategy, in which tens of thousands of U.S. and NATO troops protect the Afghan population, to a cheaper counterterrorism strategy, in which special operations forces strike at terrorist leaders in Afghanistan and Pakistan and the Afghans are left largely on their own."
63,The Iraq We Left Behind,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/iraq/2012-02-12/iraq-we-left-behind,The Iraq We Left Behind,"Nine years after U.S. troops toppled Saddam Hussein and just a few months after the last U.S. soldier left Iraq, the country has become something close to a failed state. Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki presides over a system rife with corruption and brutality, in which political leaders use security forces and militias to repress enemies and intimidate the general population. The law exists as a weapon to be wielded against rivals and to hide the misdeeds of allies. The dream of an Iraq governed by elected leaders answerable to the people is rapidly fading away."

These issues were not only given a higher priority in policy toward Latin America than they were for other regions, but they were also issues largely beyond Washington's ability to control."
65,God and Caesar in America,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2012-02-12/god-and-caesar-america,God and Caesar in America,"A Feb. 29 update to the print story from the March/April issue: In the wake of the Great Recession it would seem natural that the 2012 election would be fought over economic issues. Yet so far in the Republican primaries, we have seen social issues, and religion especially, move to the forefront. Rick Santorum is only the latest in a series of Republicans who have infused their campaigns with talk about God. Even Mitt Romney, a Mormon who has generally tried to avoid discussing religion, has recently pledged to defend ""religious liberty"" against the Obama administration. Increasingly, the rhetoric of the leading Republican contenders echoes the Republican fringe of twenty years ago. Then, we heard Pat Buchanan -- the quintessential protest candidate -- bombastically declare that America was in the midst of a culture war. Today, the frontrunners all play to the Republican base by describing the White House's ""war on religion."""

The alliance responded rapidly to a deteriorating situation that threatened hundreds of thousands of civilians rebelling against an oppressive regime. It succeeded in protecting those civilians and, ultimately, in providing the time and space necessary for local forces to overthrow Muammar al-Qaddafi. And it did so by involving partners in the region and sharing the burden among the alliance's members."
67,The Arab Spring at One,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/syria/2012-01-24/arab-spring-one,The Arab Spring at One,"Throughout 2011, a rhythmic chant echoed across the Arab lands: ""The people want to topple the regime."" It skipped borders with ease, carried in newspapers and magazines, on Twitter and Facebook, on the airwaves of al Jazeera and al Arabiya. Arab nationalism had been written off, but here, in full bloom, was what certainly looked like a pan-Arab awakening. Young people in search of political freedom and economic opportunity, weary of waking up to the same tedium day after day, rose up against their sclerotic masters."
68,Not Time to Attack Iran,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/not-time-attack-iran,Not Time to Attack Iran,"In ""Time to Attack Iran"" (January/February 2012), Matthew Kroenig takes a page out of the decade-old playbook used by advocates of the Iraq war. He portrays the threat of a nuclear-armed Iran as both grave and imminent, arguing that the United States has little choice but to attack Iran now before it is too late. Then, after offering the caveat that ""attacking Iran is hardly an attractive prospect,"" he goes on to portray military action as preferable to other available alternatives and concludes that the United States can manage all the associated risks. Preventive war, according to Kroenig, is ""the least bad option."""

0,There Will Be a One-State Solution,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/israel/2019-10-15/there-will-be-one-state-solution,There Will Be a One-State Solution,"For nearly three decades, the so-called two-state solution has dominated discussions of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. But the idea of two states for two peoples in the territory both occupy was always an illusion, and in recent years, reality has set in. The two-state solution is dead. And good riddance: it never offered a realistic path forward. The time has come for all interested parties to instead consider the only alternative with any chance of delivering lasting peace: equal rights for Israelis and Palestinians in a single shared state."
1,The Tunisia Model,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/tunisia/2019-10-15/tunisia-model,The Tunisia Model,"The story of how the Tunisian revolution began is well known. On December 17, 2010, a 26-year-old fruit vendor named Mohamed Bouazizi from the town of Sidi Bouzid set himself on fire outside a local government building. The man’s self-immolation—an act of protest against repeated mistreatment by police and local officials—sparked protests that quickly spread across the country. Within a few weeks, President Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali had stepped down and fled the country after 23 years in power, offering Tunisia an unprecedented opportunity for a democratic opening. A massive wave of uprisings soon swept the country’s neighbors, reaching all the way to the Levant and the Persian Gulf."
2,The Virtue of Monopoly,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/virtue-monopoly,The Virtue of Monopoly,"You’ve heard the story many times. The stock market is rigged. A highly secretive group of opaque financial institutions is making billions of dollars from socially useless high-frequency trading—placing and withdrawing stock orders hundreds of thousands of times per second—with all those profits coming, in one way or another, from the rest of us. The biggest losers of all? Small, mom-and-pop, or retail, investors, who cannot hope to compete."
3,War Is Not Over,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/world/war-not-over,War Is Not Over,"The political turmoil of recent years has largely disabused us of the notion that the world has reached some sort of utopian “end of history.” And yet it can still seem that ours is an unprecedented era of peace and progress. On the whole, humans today are living safer and more prosperous lives than their ancestors did. They suffer less cruelty and arbitrary violence. Above all, they seem far less likely to go to war. The incidence of war has been decreasing steadily, a growing consensus holds, with war between great powers becoming all but unthinkable and all types of war becoming more and more rare."
4,Rojo,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2019-10-15/rojo,Rojo,"This thoughtful, disturbing melodrama is set in a nondescript provincial town in Argentina in 1975. The film’s action occurs just prior to the 1976 military coup that launched the “Dirty War,” a period of repression that would end up killing thousands of Argentines. Naishtat focuses on the silence and complicity of average citizens more interested in safeguarding their own modest, quiet lives than in resisting the atrocities visited on their neighbors and peers by right-wing death squads, which were already “disappearing” opponents even before the coup. The film is dedicated to a recently deceased legal defender of political prisoners. The protagonist is Claudio, an aloof, rather haughty lawyer, well respected in his community. He gradually becomes aware of the horrors occurring all around him, but he does not get involved. Claudio’s moral center collapses utterly when he decides to make quick profits from the empty properties of victims of state terrorism. Naishtat skillfully mixes mundane scenes of daily life (birthday parties, tennis matches) with noir atmospherics and absurdist comedy. Could it happen here? The film reminds viewers everywhere that, indeed, it did happen in Argentina and that it was all too easy for many Argentines to avert their gaze from the state-sponsored violence of the Dirty War."
5,The Caribbean Policy of the Ulysses S. Grant Administration: Foreshadowing an Informal Empire,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2019-10-14/caribbean-policy-ulysses-s-grant-administration-foreshadowing,The Caribbean Policy of the Ulysses S. Grant Administration: Foreshadowing an Informal Empire,"After the Civil War, the United States embraced its “manifest destiny” to expand not only westward to the Pacific Ocean but also southward into the Caribbean. U.S. leaders actively considered the annexation of Cuba and the Dominican Republic, spurred by the lobbying of wealthy pro-annexation elites from both nations, who found a ready audience in corrupt, Gilded Age Washington. The case for annexation fell apart after wrangling between Congress and the Grant administration; however, a consensus emerged in Washington that the United States should replace Spain and the United Kingdom as the dominant foreign power in the Caribbean and that it was necessary to set up naval bases and coaling stations across the basin to protect an eventual transoceanic canal in Central America. U.S. officials differed on how to achieve these goals. Some argued for direct military intervention; others preached patience in allowing U.S. commercial power to organically secure greater influence in the Caribbean. These opposing visions of how the United States should project its power in the world still lie at the heart of foreign policy debates today."
6,Lost Children Archive: A Novel,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2019-10-15/lost-children-archive-novel,Lost Children Archive: A Novel,"The daring fiction and nonfiction of Luiselli, a New York–based, Mexican-born writer, combine literary brilliance, empathetic politics, and a dazzling imagination. She has the intellectual firepower to be her generation’s Susan Sontag (whose interest in collection, documentation, and memory Luiselli references) but possesses an even wider, more global sensibility. In her novel Lost Children Archive, Luiselli conjures a couple with two young children, aged ten and five, on a long road trip from New York to the southwestern United States in search of the grave of the Apache leader Geronimo. The novel’s “lost children” include the last Apaches as well as today’s desperate young migrants from Central America. Eventually (spoiler alert), the couple’s two children go missing. Luiselli envisions the Southwest as desolate and haunted by genocide, a xenophobic wasteland occupied by a brutal border patrol. The loving interplay between the two children lightens the brooding atmosphere. Miraculously, the children never quarrel during long hours of driving, instead amusing themselves with songs, word games, and fantasies. In Luiselli’s deft hands, children are our shame and our redemption."
7,Two Books on Latin American History,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2019-10-15/two-books-latin-american-history,Two Books on Latin American History,"In trying to weave a coherent narrative of centuries of Latin American history, Arana too often relies on a handful of thin sources and simplifies complicated events. In her telling, venal, self-interested elites (“silver”), violent rulers and rebels (“sword”), and cynical, compromised religious institutions (“stone”) have perennially plagued the region. The Aztecs, the Incas, and the Spanish were all bloody-minded peoples tamed only by brutal despots; homegrown revolutionaries inevitably became “tinpot dictators, insatiable caesars.” Arana’s bleak vision sees no enduring success stories, no emerging middle-class democracies, no meaningful social progress. Latin America is defined only by “the essential exploitation at its core, the racial divisions, the extreme poverty . . . the corrosive culture of corruption.” By perpetuating such profoundly negative (and poorly substantiated) stereotypes, Arana inadvertently provides ammunition for U.S. President Donald Trump’s disparaging comments about the region."
8,The Future of British Foreign Policy: Security and Diplomacy in a World After Brexit,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2019-10-15/future-british-foreign-policy-security-and-diplomacy-world-after,The Future of British Foreign Policy: Security and Diplomacy in a World After Brexit,"This book by a respected Cambridge professor seeks to predict how Brexit will affect the United Kingdom’s diplomacy and geopolitical standing. A classic academic policy book, it proceeds at a leisurely pace. It takes a hundred pages to reach the central question: Will Brexit actually make any difference to British foreign policy? Or can London and its partners simply replicate their current levels of cooperation by other, perhaps more informal means? Here, Hill seems unsure. On the one hand, he persuasively dismisses as nonsense the rhetoric of Brexiteers about renewing special relationships with English-speaking peoples and forging bilateral agreements with China, India, Russia, and others. On the other hand, he recognizes that EU foreign policy is still decentralized, with member states allowed to set their own agendas, and that the United Kingdom has always played a “semi-detached” role in the making of EU foreign policy. How much will actually change? This fine overview concludes with more questions than answers."
9,Hitler: A Global Biography,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2019-10-15/hitler-global-biography,Hitler: A Global Biography,"Too many books are written about Hitler. Many are amateur efforts, and even those that aren’t rarely add anything new. Yet this vivid and painstakingly researched volume revises fundamentally how historians ought to view the geopolitical motivations of the Nazi leader. Simms argues that Hitler did not see the Soviet Union as the primary obstacle to his expansionist ambitions. From the start, his real enemies were the United Kingdom and the United States, the victors of World War I, the conflict that had decisively shaped his worldview. These countries were (from Hitler’s perspective) racially pure “Anglo-Saxon” superpowers that possessed significant air and naval power, lorded over colonies, and molded the “plutocratic” system of international finance. Hitler’s supposedly controversial strategic choices—such as diverting military resources to the Balkans, declaring an apparently needless war on the United States, launching a brutal attack on the Soviet Union, and even attempting to exterminate the Jews—were far more rational than most critics allow, given his often idiosyncratic assumptions. All these actions were part of a larger mobilization of resources and popular support for an inevitable war of attrition against the Anglo-Saxons. Some will dispute this thesis. Nevertheless, the book is engaging and essential reading for anyone interested in Hitler’s policymaking."
10,The Silk Road Trap: How China’s Trade Ambitions Challenge Europe,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2019-10-15/silk-road-trap-how-chinas-trade-ambitions-challenge-europe,The Silk Road Trap: How China’s Trade Ambitions Challenge Europe,"Holslag claims that China poses a mortal economic threat to Europe and the West. The topic is timely, since the EU is currently considering following the United States in tightening controls on Chinese trade and investment. Of course, this book is hardly the first to list Beijing’s sins: bilateral trade surpluses, unfair treatment of foreign investors and firms, and forced technology transfers. Nor does it contain original data or rigorous analysis. For example, nowhere does Holslag explain why bilateral deficits and debt should matter to a region that runs a net external surplus or specify exactly what political threats a competitive China poses to Europe. The author argues, however, that what is needed is less theory and more policy analysis: in the introduction, he suggests that European countries need to band together and act decisively in order to maximize their economic growth. It is surprising, therefore, that the conclusion proposes no specific policies except, in just one sentence, the adoption of stronger but fewer European standards."
11,Protest and Power: The Battle for the Labour Party,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2019-10-15/protest-and-power-battle-labour-party,Protest and Power: The Battle for the Labour Party,"Two decades after the triumph of “New Labour” under Tony Blair, why is the British Labour Party run by a left-wing radical who favors nationalization, coddles autocrats, flirts with anti-Semitism, and lacks either the will or the ability to oppose Brexit outright? Based on detailed interviews and crammed with juicy anecdotes, this book is in many ways the definitive chronicle of Jeremy Corbyn’s unlikely march from backbench obscurity to party leadership. Like many accounts by insider journalists, however, its underlying explanation rests almost entirely on personalities, accidents, errors, and dumb luck. From this perspective, the reemergence of the Labour left resulted from a backlash against Blair’s involvement in the Iraq war, changes that “democratized” Labour party rules and boosted radicals over moderates, and New Labour’s mismanaged privatization policies. Kogan neglects to trace the larger forces—including globalization, inequality, deindustrialization, and nationalism—that have undermined the political order in every Western democracy, not just in the United Kingdom."
12,Eric Hobsbawm: A Life in History,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2019-10-15/eric-hobsbawm-life-history,Eric Hobsbawm: A Life in History,"This biography traces the life of Eric Hobsbawm, one of the greatest historians of the twentieth century and an unrepentant communist. His story, with all its contradictions, parallels that of many radical leftist intellectuals in Europe during the middle of the century. A lower-class Jewish orphan who grew up in Vienna and Berlin during the 1930s, Hobsbawm took to the streets to fight fascists and reasonably concluded that strict solidarity with a radical party was the only way to make political change. He never renounced communism, as so many other leftists ultimately did. But he did come to place greater value on intellectual diversity, tolerant leadership, and grassroots organization within left-wing politics. Hobsbawm’s writings helped revolutionize the historical profession. He wrote omnivorously, on banditry, Luddism, local anarchism, rural uprisings, agricultural collectives, and other forms of working-class and peasant resistance to the march of industrialization. In later life, as a respected university professor and BBC lecturer, he penned a series of revisionist Marxist histories of Europe’s industrialization, revolutions, and empires that became bestsellers—not least in the developing world, which was then undergoing similar upheavals."
13,The Unsettling of Europe: How Migration Reshaped a Continent,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2019-11-01/unsettling-europe-how-migration-reshaped-continent,The Unsettling of Europe: How Migration Reshaped a Continent,"This important book puts today’s levels of migration to Europe in historical perspective. Far from being unprecedented, large population movements have been the norm since World War II, after which over 12 million people fled Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. From the 1950s on, Eastern Europeans steadily left the Soviet bloc. In the 1960s, decolonization led millions to head for metropoles in the West, and guest workers came northward to Germany from countries such as Turkey (although the great majority of these Gastarbeiter returned home). The end of the century saw further displacement caused by wars in the former Yugoslavia and waves of economic immigration. The author, a demographic historian, concludes with a dose of idealism: Europe should embrace immigration and diversity, which have made the continent what it is. Yet this seems to ignore political reality. Recent migration rates are the highest Europe has seen since the postwar movement of Germans. The percentage of foreign-born people in France, Germany, Italy, Sweden, and the United Kingdom is substantially higher than it was decades ago. In a period of low economic growth, European societies are grappling with tricky questions of cultural integration and difference. This book does surprisingly little to illuminate how many governments today face the political pressure to restrict immigration."

Yet Atkinson is best known as the author of acclaimed volumes on World War II. Like those books, his new one is mostly a military history, and less an account of the broader revolution. Still, Atkinson displays a remarkable ability to bring leaders and unnamed soldiers alike into three-dimensional clarity. Wonderful maps enrich the narrative and capture the reader’s imagination, distinguishing taverns from churches and rail fences from stone walls. Although the narrative at times wallows in the sheer physical misery of fighting and dying in a brutal war, few who read the prologue will want to put the book down until they’ve finished the whole thing."
15,Two Books on Democracy,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2019-10-15/two-books-democracy,Two Books on Democracy,"Diamond and Tomasky, both longtime students of democracy, have produced similarly impassioned works on the current democratic crisis. Diamond’s view is global, describing the worldwide slide toward authoritarianism over the past two decades. Tomasky focuses on what is happening in the United States, tracing the country’s current woes back almost to its founding. The global trends Diamond chronicles predate the election of U.S. President Donald Trump, but his analysis rests heavily on his “anguished knowledge” of what the Trump presidency means for governance around the world. By contrast, Tomasky writes that “most of this book could have appeared just as it now stands” no matter who won the 2016 election. Notwithstanding such differences, both authors identify the same ultimate saviors: not politicians or legal or constitutional changes but, in Diamond’s words, “the last line of defense: ‘We the People.’”"
16,"Leap of Faith: Hubris, Negligence, and America’s Greatest Foreign Policy Tragedy",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2019-10-15/leap-faith-hubris-negligence-and-americas-greatest-foreign-policy,"Leap of Faith: Hubris, Negligence, and America’s Greatest Foreign Policy Tragedy","Mazarr begins with the pundit George Will’s assessment that the decision to invade Iraq in 2003 was “worse than Vietnam, and the worst in American history.” Yet, he notes, we still don’t know when or how the decision to go to war was made: our understanding of why this catastrophe took place is “radically incomplete.” His attempt to close the gaps puts a great deal of the story into one thoroughly researched and eminently readable volume. Mazarr attributes the decision to invade to a characteristically American “missionary impulse” combined with “intuitive, value-driven judgment.” That’s a polite way of saying that the war was conceived by men and women who, although not evil, were so sure in their convictions regarding a country about which they knew hardly anything that they excused themselves from rigorous thought about what they were doing and why they were doing it and indulged in egregious distortions of the facts regarding Iraq’s weapons programs. It’s not obvious that there are lessons in this sorry tale that will help avoid a repetition of those blunders and misdeeds. Ironically, Mazarr himself is unable to pinpoint when and how the decision to go to war was made. But his story is an important one, and well told."
17,"Kissinger on Kissinger: Reflections on Diplomacy, Grand Strategy, and Leadership",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2019-10-15/kissinger-kissinger-reflections-diplomacy-grand-strategy-and,"Kissinger on Kissinger: Reflections on Diplomacy, Grand Strategy, and Leadership","Henry Kissinger has written about his time in government in lengthy books that often go into excruciating detail. This little volume, his only foray into oral history, does the opposite: it distills—and therein lies its attraction. As one man’s view of events, it does not pretend to be a balanced history. But Kissinger’s accounts of the strategies that he and U.S. President Richard Nixon pursued in a series of crucial events—the opening to China, the 1972 summit with Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev, the first arms control negotiations with the Soviets—make for fascinating reading and serve as a timely reminder of what serious, farsighted diplomacy looks like. Participants must from the outset be able to answer the question, “What are we trying to do here?” They must be deeply versed in the other side’s history and present interests, demonstrate steely patience, and know that the precondition for a successful negotiation is “victory for both sides.” Kissinger’s insightful conversations with Lord, a veteran diplomat who worked as a close aide to Kissinger, are refreshingly stripped of the formal language of a published memoir, allowing his insights to shine through."
18,Presidential Misconduct: From George Washington to Today,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2019-10-15/presidential-misconduct-george-washington-today,Presidential Misconduct: From George Washington to Today,"In 1974, John Doar, special counsel to the House committee handling impeachment proceedings against U.S. President Richard Nixon, decided that the committee’s work would benefit from expert analysis that would compare Nixon’s wrongdoing to that of past presidents. In an astonishing eight weeks, a team of 15 scholars, recruited and led by the historian C. Vann Woodward, produced a volume of brief, factual reviews of misconduct by every administration from George Washington’s through Lyndon Johnson’s, excluding purely private behavior or actions that the authors judged to be merely partisan or ideological. Their work has now been reissued with added reviews of eight more administrations (Nixon’s through Barack Obama’s). The new volume was spearheaded by Banner, a member of the original team, who describes it as an exercise of “historians’ civic office.” The result is a fascinating glimpse into a largely unstudied aspect of U.S. political history and a look at the disappointing, if not depressing, weaknesses of the political, legal, and constitutional remedies available to deter or punish presidential malfeasance. Particularly rewarding are overviews written by Woodward and Banner, which include the sort of judgments that the authors of the individual reviews were directed to avoid."
19,Two Books on Piracy,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2019-10-15/two-books-piracy,Two Books on Piracy,"In his lively, vivid history of pirates, Lehr finds some striking continuities from ancient to modern times. Although pirates are motivated above all by greed, creed and religion have often influenced their choice of targets. The lure of large rewards from little effort has always attracted the impoverished. Careers tend to be short, as much because of the hazards of the sea as the threat of legal sanction and punishment. Most pirates have preferred to ambush their prey, frightening the crew into surrender and only fighting their way onboard if necessary. The best defense against pirates is having a vessel faster than theirs. Regions plagued by weak governance and local corruption enable piracy. Certain coastlines have long been favorable hunting grounds: in the 1990s, Somali pirates “loitered in the approaches of the Bab el-Mandeb in the Gulf of Aden,” just as John “Long Ben” Avery did in the seventeenth century."

A young sergeant named Mikhail Kalashnikov figured out how to improve the standard assault rifle used by the Soviet army in World War II. The gun that still bears his name is easy to use, reliable, and durable—and became the weapon of choice for terrorists and militias around the world. In this meticulously researched book, Cronin shows how groups such as the Islamic State (or ISIS) exploit new technologies such as the Internet, smartphones, autonomous vehicles, and artificial intelligence. Cronin hardly wants innovation to stop just because of potentially malign applications. Instead, she argues that governments must develop countermeasures to preempt militants from co-opting innovations to catastrophic effect."
21,The Nuclear Spies: America’s Atomic Intelligence Operation Against Hitler and Stalin,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2019-10-15/nuclear-spies-americas-atomic-intelligence-operation-against,The Nuclear Spies: America’s Atomic Intelligence Operation Against Hitler and Stalin,"The atom bomb was never a high priority for the Nazis, at least when compared with their development of long-range cruise and ballistic missiles. A major U.S. intelligence operation during World War II confirmed that the German nuclear threat was not as great as had been feared. Specialist teams followed the Allied armies into Italy and Germany, gathering information on the German atomic project but also trying to secure the relevant scientists, materials, and papers before they could fall into Soviet hands. Intriguingly, U.S. intelligence officials also hoped to keep the French at a distance because of the feared communist sympathies of France’s leading nuclear scientists. In this neat, enthralling study, Houghton wonders why this successful intelligence operation was followed by the failure to anticipate the first Soviet nuclear test in August 1949. He points to the incoherence of the U.S. intelligence system after the war and the complacent underestimation of the capacities of a communist government."

Bush’s Decision to Surge in Iraq,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2019-10-15/last-card-inside-george-w-bushs-decision-surge-iraq,The Last Card: Inside George W. Bush’s Decision to Surge in Iraq,"In early 2007, as U.S. troops struggled to contain a raging civil war in Iraq, President George W. Bush announced a “surge” of five additional brigades to the country. Based on interviews with many of the key participants, including the president, the first part of this book describes how the decision was made. For Bush, the alternative to the surge was defeat. He met with considerable opposition at high levels of his own administration but skillfully managed the process of winning broad support for his view. The book features some dissenting voices, but most of the interviewees approved of both the handling and the outcome of the surge. Conspicuous in their absence are Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and General George Casey, commander of U.S. forces in Iraq. They stayed committed to their established strategy even though it was widely judged to be failing. Indeed, the book leaves one wishing that the original decision to invade Iraq had been taken with as much care as the decision to change course. Although repetitive at times, this is a fascinating contribution to the history of the war."

Preserving access to energy is not simply an economic matter but a question of grand strategy. This informative book focuses on how China and the United States, both large importers of oil, secured their energy supplies between 1992 and 2013. It compares the evolution of both countries’ strategies for guaranteeing oil security through shifts in policy and advances in technology. Opsal claims that the United States is well ahead of China in oil security on many fronts, but China is rapidly catching up."
25,Digital Transformation: Survive and Thrive in an Era of Mass Extinction,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2019-10-15/digital-transformation-survive-and-thrive-era-mass-extinction,Digital Transformation: Survive and Thrive in an Era of Mass Extinction,"The “mass extinction” of the subtitle refers to business firms that fail to digitize their operations. Successful digitization, according to Siebel, involves mastering four key technologies: flexible cloud computing, big data, artificial intelligence, and the Internet of Things. In the public sector, digitization will allow governments to reduce costs and improve services. Siebel details useful case studies of U.S. and European firms that have benefited from digitization, such as John Deere, 3M, and Italy’s Enel. He also examines the U.S. Air Force’s use of artificial intelligence to anticipate maintenance requirements for airplanes. The book sounds a note of warning in tracing the ambitious pace of digitization in China, which is virtually at war with the United States and other Western countries in developing and exploiting new technologies."

This unusual book highlights “four horsemen of the optimist”: effective capitalism, technological progress, public awareness, and effective government. Free markets and advancing technologies provide the basis for material well-being; a free press and strong governance check uncontrolled greed and protect against social and environmental harms. McAfee favors social democracy over socialism, insisting on a sharp distinction between the two. His most surprising finding concerns the U.S. economy. Over the past two decades, the material standard of living of Americans has continued to rise even as Americans consume fewer physical resources, such as water, metals, and building materials. McAfee sees these trends spreading to the rest of the world."

Bateman seeks to widen the discipline’s focus on marketable goods and services to include other social and personal activities that affect economies. The most striking thesis of the book is that the “rise of the West” during and after the Industrial Revolution—a development that still puzzles many economic historians because Europe had long lagged behind China, India, and the Islamic Middle East—was due to the way women were treated differently in western European societies. Although women are subordinate to men in most societies, women enjoyed relatively greater freedom in western Europe (particularly in Protestant northwestern Europe) than in other parts of the world at the time. Women married later, had fewer children, and were better educated. This greater freedom led to more saving and more productive investment."
28,The Antitrust Paradigm: Restoring a Competitive Economy,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2019-10-15/antitrust-paradigm-restoring-competitive-economy,The Antitrust Paradigm: Restoring a Competitive Economy,"Baker, a former director of the Federal Trade Commission, believes that the U.S. government has gone much too far in relaxing the enforcement of its century-old antitrust laws. He places a substantial measure of blame on the so-called Chicago school of economics, whose free-market theories have wielded substantial influence over agencies entrusted with the enforcement of financial regulations and over the courts, particularly the Supreme Court. The results of lax enforcement include an increased concentration of market share in both new and old industries, the growth of corporate profits as a percentage of total income, and a decline in overall productivity. In Baker’s view, contrary to what others claim, these outcomes are not justified by any resulting innovation: indeed, many acquisitions by large firms are intended to suppress upstarts. The book’s detailed analysis draws almost entirely on U.S. laws, institutions, and court decisions, albeit with a favorable nod to competition policy in the eu. But Baker’s arguments apply to all modern economies, which must establish and maintain competition in order to thrive."

Scholars have typically pointed to the shared democratic values of its members, which many believe forge a unique bond. In his carefully researched history, Sayle inverts this conventional understanding. In NATO's early decades, government elites maintained the pact as a buffer against the whims of fickle democratic electorates that might too quickly succumb to Soviet peace overtures and undermine the balance of power in the Cold War. Drawing on extensive archival records, Sayle rehearses in detail the founding of NATO and its early operations, highlighting the importance of intergovernmental elites—ministers, diplomats, commanders—working outside public view to manage and protect the alliance’s integrity. NATO’s resiliency is rooted in the day-to-day efforts of this multinational corps of officials, dedicated to keeping the alliance afloat. What is NATO's future? Sayle argues that the underlying rationale for the alliance still holds, although updated slightly for today: keeping the Russians out, the Americans in, and the Europeans together."

He explores the worlds of hackers, trolls, and purveyors of fake news, making stops in the Philippines, Russia, Serbia, Turkey, Ukraine, and a number of countries in Latin America. The dark arts are evolving as authoritarian regimes learn to speak in the vernacular of the digital age, spreading fake news through social media, talk shows, and reality TV shows. “Digital vigilantes” employed by hostile governments flood Western societies with conspiracy theories and “alternative facts” to sow confusion and erode faith in democratic institutions. Through many anecdotes and colorful stories, Pomerantsev tells a depressing morality tale of the age: it was thought that technology and information would strengthen democratic, liberal, and open societies; make public debate more informed; and generate cooperation across borders—but the opposite has happened. Information is now weaponized, and one country can come close to destroying another “almost without touching it.”"
31,Rethinking Global Governance,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2019-10-15/rethinking-global-governance,Rethinking Global Governance,"Coined in the 1990s, the term “global governance” tried to capture the multifaceted ways in which governments, companies, transnational groups, and international organizations worked in concert in a time of growing interdependence. Today, talk of global governance is out of fashion. Many people hear the phrase and think it is some sort of elite form of “globalism.” This short, pithy book makes the case for a new scholarly focus on international cooperation. Weiss and Wilkinson argue that although resurgent populism and nationalism have prompted attacks on globalization, the fact remains that the world is more intensely interconnected than ever before. From financial markets to refugee flows to production networks, there is no escaping the ways in which modern societies are vulnerable to one another. Weiss and Wilkinson argue that scholars must urgently make the case that international cooperation strengthens rather than weakens people’s ability to take control of and improve their own lives."

He argues that a series of small changes in economic, social, and political life across the Western world conspired to erode the consensus-oriented model of democracy that had emerged after World War II. The Bretton Woods regime collapsed, triggering shifts in how governments cooperated and managed their economies. The OPEC oil shocks ushered in stagflation and an end to the early postwar commitments to full employment. New forms of identity politics followed the cultural upheavals of the 1960s. Crucially, centrist forces and institutions across the Western system began to break up in this era as the old compromises between labor and capital frayed. In the battle of ideas, the postwar Keynesian consensus gave way to conservative theories about monetarism and the deregulation of markets. Many of these stories are familiar, but Reid-Henry is particularly good at revealing the subtle social and cultural transformations that unfolded in dozens of countries, including some often overlooked places."

The Past, Present, and Promise of a Noble Idea",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2019-10-15/what-was-liberalism-past-present-and-promise-noble-idea,"What Was Liberalism? The Past, Present, and Promise of a Noble Idea","As liberals grapple with rising populism and authoritarianism, Traub turns to history and theory to reclaim liberalism’s principles. His book mounts one of the best efforts of this kind yet, tracing liberalism’s core ideas from the age of democratic revolutions to the grand ideological struggles of the twentieth century to the convulsions of the current vexed moment. Traub shows that liberalism is an amalgam of often conflicting ideas: classical republican principles, Lockean individualism, the commitment to popular sovereignty, and evolving notions of rights and progressive social ideals. Various settings and figures populate the narrative, but Traub sees John Stuart Mill as the pivotal thinker linking the classical and modern strains of liberalism. Mill insisted that political institutions had to manage the tradeoffs between liberty and equality and foster the social conditions for individuals to flourish. In the United States, the reformist ideas of Theodore Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, and other progressives in the early twentieth century brought these impulses into the industrial age, but only through President Franklin Roosevelt and the New Deal did modern liberalism find a way to bridge a Jeffersonian appeal to citizenship and a Hamiltonian commitment to an activist state. Traub argues that liberalism lost its way in the 1990s, aligning itself with globalization and losing its deeper commitment to a progressive vision of nationalism and the common man."
34,America’s Great Satan,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/middle-east/2019-10-15/americas-great-satan,America’s Great Satan,"Imagine historians a century from now trying to decide which foreign power the United States feared most in the decades from the late Cold War through 2020. Sifting through the national security strategies of successive administrations, they would see Russia first as an arch-enemy of the United States, then as a friend, and finally as a challenging nuisance. They would see China transform from a sometime partner to a great-power rival. North Korea would appear as a sideshow."
35,Disaster in the Desert,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/middle-east/2019-10-15/disaster-desert,Disaster in the Desert,"In July 2019, Jason Greenblatt, then U.S. President Donald Trump’s envoy for Israeli-Palestinian negotiations, attended a routine quarterly UN Security Council meeting about the Middle East. Providing an update on the Trump administration’s thinking about the peace process, he pointedly told the surprised audience that the United States no longer respected the “fiction” of an international consensus on the Israeli-Palestinian issue."
36,Let Russia Be Russia,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/russia-fsu/2019-10-15/let-russia-be-russia,Let Russia Be Russia,"Since the end of the Cold War, every U.S. president has come into office promising to build better relations with Russia—and each one has watched that vision evaporate. The first three—Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama—set out to integrate Russia into the Euro-Atlantic community and make it a partner in building a global liberal order. Each left office with relations in worse shape than he found them, and with Russia growing ever more distant."
37,The Unwinnable Trade War,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/asia/2019-10-08/unwinnable-trade-war,The Unwinnable Trade War,"In late June, the leaders of China and the United States announced at the G-20 meeting in Osaka, Japan, that they had reached a détente in their trade war. U.S. President Donald Trump claimed that the two sides had set negotiations “back on track.” He put on hold new tariffs on Chinese goods and lifted restrictions preventing U.S. companies from selling to Huawei, the blacklisted Chinese telecommunications giant. Markets rallied, and media reports hailed the move as a “cease-fire.”"
38,How a Caliphate Ends,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/review-essay/2019-10-15/how-caliphate-ends,How a Caliphate Ends,"The origin story that James Verini tells about his new book, They Will Have to Die Now, is about guilt—his guilt for not having gone to Iraq earlier. On 9/11, in his first newspaper job, he covered the collapse of the Twin Towers. He writes that a couple of years later, he “could have, should have, gone to Iraq but didn’t.” He was, he says, “too scared.”"
39,The New Masters of the Universe,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/review-essay/2019-10-10/new-masters-universe,The New Masters of the Universe,"In his 1944 classic, The Great Transformation, the economic historian Karl Polanyi told the story of modern capitalism as a “double movement” that led to both the expansion of the market and its restriction. During the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, old feudal restraints on commerce were abolished, and land, labor, and money came to be treated as commodities. But unrestrained capitalism ravaged the environment, damaged public health, and led to economic panics and depressions, and by the time Polanyi was writing, societies had reintroduced limits on the market."
40,What Is White America?,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/review-essay/2019-10-15/what-white-america,What Is White America?,"The U.S. presidential election of 2016 altered the prevailing American ideology of race. Donald Trump’s coy, borderline white nationalism helped turn people who previously happened to be white into “white people”—coded as white in an essential way, just as, for instance, black people are coded as black in an essential way. Many observers were slow to grasp the political ramifications of citizens who happen to be white voting first and foremost as white people. In the immediate aftermath of the election, commentators rushed to ascribe Trump’s victory to economic disarray in the heartland and to a subset of voters lamenting their loss of jobs and stability. It took a couple of years for journalists, pollsters, and scholars to find a sounder explanation: by and large, most white Trump supporters were not voting out of economic self-interest; rather, they were resentful of social changes that threatened their taken-for-granted position atop a social hierarchy—despite the fact that the vast majority of those who held political power were white (and male), white families’ wealth was still six and a half times as great as black families’ wealth, and black families headed by college graduates had about 33 percent less wealth than white families headed by high school dropouts."
41,Nowhere to Go,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/americas/2019-10-15/nowhere-go,Nowhere to Go,"In 2015, over 1.2 million asylum seekers arrived in the European Union. They were fleeing war zones in Afghanistan, South Sudan, and Syria; economic deprivation in Nigeria and Pakistan; and political instability in Somalia. The largest group came across the Aegean Sea; many of them reached European territory in Greece and then made their way to Germany. Others crossed the Mediterranean on rickety, overloaded boats or traversed the Bosporus, the Dardanelles, or the Gibraltar strait. Politicians and journalists labeled the situation a “crisis” to reflect its unprecedented scale. But this was not a crisis of numbers. It was a crisis of politics. European leaders initially resorted to unilateral, quick-fix solutions. German Chancellor Angela Merkel implemented a short-lived open-border policy. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban built a razor-wire fence. Other countries sought to accommodate, sequester, or cast out the migrants—mostly to no avail. The human consequences were devastating: over 10,000 people have drowned while crossing the Mediterranean since 2015. Those who made it were greeted not as survivors but as usurpers, free riders, or covert extremists; they soon became scapegoats for the radical right. The political consequences changed Europe forever."
42,The Progressive Case Against Protectionism,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/united-states/progressive-case-against-protectionism,The Progressive Case Against Protectionism,"It has almost become the new Washington consensus: decades of growing economic openness have hurt American workers, increased inequality, and gutted the middle class, and new restrictions on trade and immigration can work to reverse the damage. This view is a near reversal of the bipartisan consensus in favor of openness to the world that defined U.S. economic policy for decades. From the end of World War II on, under both Democratic and Republican control, Congress and the White House consistently favored free trade and relatively unrestrictive immigration policies. Candidates would make protectionist noises to appease various constituencies from time to time, but by and large, such rhetoric was confined to the margins. Almost never did it translate into actual policy."
43,The Middle East’s Lost Decades,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/middle-east/middle-easts-lost-decades,The Middle East’s Lost Decades,"Since the 9/11 attacks, the Arab world’s relative economic, social, and political underdevelopment has been a topic of near-constant international concern. In a landmark 2002 report, the UN Development Program (UNDP) concluded that Arab countries lagged behind much of the world in development indicators such as political freedom, scientific progress, and the rights of women. Under U.S. President George W. Bush, this analysis helped drive the “freedom agenda,” which aimed to democratize the Middle East—by force if necessary—in order to eradicate the underdevelopment and authoritarianism that some officials in Washington believed were the root causes of terrorism. Bush’s successor, Barack Obama, criticized one of the cornerstones of the freedom agenda—the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003—but he shared Bush’s diagnosis. In his first major foreign policy speech as president, delivered in Cairo in 2009, Obama called on Middle Eastern governments to make progress in democracy, religious freedom, gender equality, and “economic development and opportunity.” Implicit in his remarks was a widely shared view among Western observers of the Middle East: that the Arab world’s dysfunction was a product of social and political arrangements that thwarted human potential, furthered inequality, and favored a small elite to the detriment of the broader population."
44,The Dream Palace of the Americans,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/israel/2019-10-15/dream-palace-americans,The Dream Palace of the Americans,"The Trump administration’s Middle East policies have been roundly attacked by the U.S. foreign policy establishment. There are various lines of criticism, including ones concerning its approaches to Egypt, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and Syria, but the administration’s gravest sin is generally held to be its support for Israel. By moving the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem, blessing Israel’s annexation of the Golan Heights, and other gestures, the Trump team is said to have overturned half a century of settled U.S. policy, abandoned the Palestinians, and killed the two-state solution."
45,The Unwanted Wars,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/middle-east/2019-10-02/unwanted-wars,The Unwanted Wars,"The war that now looms largest is a war nobody apparently wants. During his presidential campaign, Donald Trump railed against the United States’ entanglement in Middle Eastern wars, and since assuming office, he has not changed his tune. Iran has no interest in a wide-ranging conflict that it knows it could not win. Israel is satisfied with calibrated operations in Iraq, Lebanon, Syria, and Gaza but fears a larger confrontation that could expose it to thousands of rockets. Saudi Arabia is determined to push back against Iran, but without confronting it militarily. Yet the conditions for an all-out war in the Middle East are riper than at any time in recent memory."

47,Adventures in Zambian Politics: A Story in Black and White,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2019-10-15/adventures-zambian-politics-story-black-and-white,Adventures in Zambian Politics: A Story in Black and White,"Born in what was then Northern Rhodesia to British parents, Scott renounced his British citizenship and chose to remain in Zambia after the country won its independence in 1964. He has been a government economist, a farmer, a leader of a farmers’ union, a democracy activist, one of the founders of the Patriotic Front (the party currently in power), and a vice president under the presidency of Michael Sata. Scott briefly became acting president, for three months, in late 2014, after Sata’s death. In this engaging and often witty memoir surveying his career, Scott revels in the fact that this last credential makes him the only white person to have served as president in an African electoral democracy. His memoir is particularly entertaining concerning recent Zambian politics, with its nasty personal rivalries and underhanded conspiracies. Scott recounts with great insight the rise of the Patriotic Front through two national elections. He is a modest narrator, and the real hero of his story is Sata, his political patron and mentor. Although observers of Zambia often criticize Sata as an unscrupulous populist whose election in 2011 began the current democratic backsliding, he emerges from this book as an eccentric but brilliant political entrepreneur who cared deeply about Zambia and its people."

Mendy often draws such grandiose comparisons but fails to substantiate them. But he does succeed in following the fascinating arc of Cabral’s life. Cabral went from an impoverished youth in the Portuguese colonies of Cape Verde and Guinea-Bissau to a university scholarship in Lisbon. He had a brief but illustrious career as an agricultural engineer for the Portuguese colonial government before he became a revolutionary advocate of independence and the leader of an armed guerrilla movement in Guinea-Bissau. He was gunned down in mysterious circumstances by a disgruntled lieutenant a year before the country won its independence, in 1974. Cabral tirelessly sought international support for his movement, and Mendy ably describes the pace and spirit of the international anticolonial circuit of the 1960s and early 1970s, with Cabral jetting to endless rounds of consultations in capitals such as Havana and Bucharest and addressing the UN’s Special Committee on Decolonization, all while trying to outwit Portuguese intelligence services."
49,The Scramble for Europe: Young Africa on Its Way to the Old Continent,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2019-10-15/scramble-europe-young-africa-its-way-old-continent,The Scramble for Europe: Young Africa on Its Way to the Old Continent,"In this sometimes rambling but always interesting long essay, Smith directly tackles the issue of African immigration to Europe only in the last couple of chapters. The preceding sections focus on recent socioeconomic trends in Africa, with a particular emphasis on the continent’s demographics. Smith makes the familiar idea of an African “youth bulge” (in which high fertility results in a very young population) more compelling by documenting a new dividing line when it comes to inequality in the region: age. Today, in countries across the continent, a minority of older people is trying to retain its political and economic privileges at the expense of a younger cohort. Smith argues that inequality is one of the motivations for young Africans to undertake the very dangerous trip to Europe but suggests that a “sense of adventure” spurs their journeys, as well. Although he laments the region’s poverty, he views sharp increases in the number of African immigrants to Europe as inevitable, even if African economies continue their recent acceleration. Greater access to funds and closer links with Europe will strengthen both the ability and the desire of would-be immigrants to make the trip. The book ends on a sour note, arguing that this scramble for Europe will only sap Africa of the energy it needs to confront its own challenges and will increase unemployment and undermine welfare states in Europe."
50,African Americans and Africa: A New History,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2019-10-15/african-americans-and-africa-new-history,African Americans and Africa: A New History,"Blyden has produced a fascinating book on the relationship between African Americans and the African continent from the era of slavery, to the late-nineteenth-century movements to return African Americans to West Africa, to the twentieth-century civil rights movement, to the eventual presidency of Barack Obama in the twenty-first century. She skillfully reveals the emergence and evolution of a distinctly African American identity through the writings and lives of black intellectuals, ranging from the eighteenth-century ex-slave and poet Phillis Wheatley to later figures such as the historian and activist W. E. B. Du Bois and the author Richard Wright. A recurring theme of the book is that African Americans have looked to Africa when their prospects in the United States have seemed particularly bleak and unpromising. Blyden also notes the ambiguity of that longing for Africa; for many African Americans, engagement with the continent has sparked a recognition of their distinctly American identity as much as it has engendered a sense of solidarity with Africans. Over a million Africans have immigrated to the United States in the last 30 years, a trend that may again remake black America."
51,Chairman Xi Remakes the PLA: Assessing Chinese Military Reforms,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2019-10-15/chairman-xi-remakes-pla-assessing-chinese-military-reforms,Chairman Xi Remakes the PLA: Assessing Chinese Military Reforms,"This terrific book definitively assesses the ongoing reforms to China’s armed forces that General Secretary Xi Jinping announced in late 2015. The reforms seek to strengthen the People’s Liberation Army’s operational effectiveness and ability to conduct joint operations in what Chinese strategists call “informationized local wars,” recognizing the importance of information and data to modern warfare. The authors of this edited volume are leading observers and analysts of the pla and Chinese defense affairs. Eighteen meticulously researched chapters examine all aspects of the reforms, including their motivations, the changes to command structures they have brought about, and their effect on civil-military relations. The reforms are unprecedented in their scale and scope, abolishing the old general-staff system, strengthening the party’s Central Military Commission, and creating new theater commands to make the armed forces more agile in war."

But Yellen shows that it was an authentic vision—however murky and evolving—for a new kind of regional order. Drawing on what were then widely accepted ideas about racial hierarchies, regional economic blocs, and economic planning, the sphere’s advocates envisioned Asia as a “familial community” that would free itself from European exploitation under the leadership of an advanced Japan. Each nation would perform its economic role according to its natural abilities, coordinated by a planning system that would ensure a share in common prosperity for everyone. Nationalist elites in Burma and the Philippines—two case studies Yellen uses to illustrate Asian responses to this vision—thought they would be freer in an empire run according to those principles than in the British and American empires, to which their countries belonged, respectively, at the time. This study suggests that Japanese thinking during the war was not so different from that of other ambitious powers throughout history, which believed they were helping other peoples by dominating them."

Whatever the state of Mongolia’s domestic politics, the enduring geostrategic reality is the presence of two large, intrusive neighbors, China and Russia. Mongolia’s “third neighbor” policy offsets their influence by pursuing relations with as many other countries and institutions as possible, including the United States, the EU, and Asian democracies—and also North Korea, which Mongolian officials see as a potential transit route to the Pacific, and Iran and Turkey, two countries seeking to diversify their own foreign relations. Mongolia has been less successful in avoiding economic dependence on China. The collapse of the Soviet Union led to the “renomadization” of much of the Mongolian workforce when trade and aid from Moscow ended, leaving the economy increasingly reliant on Chinese investments in and purchases from the country’s coal, copper, and iron mines and oil fields. The only way out of this dependency would be to strengthen links with other economies, which ironically would depend on persuading Beijing to include Mongolia in its Belt and Road Initiative."
54,Nightmarch: Among India’s Revolutionary Guerrillas,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2019-10-15/nightmarch-among-indias-revolutionary-guerrillas,Nightmarch: Among India’s Revolutionary Guerrillas,"Over years of fieldwork, the anthropologist Shah gained unusual access to the leftist Naxalite insurgency that has persisted in the hills and forests of central and eastern India for over 50 years. She builds her analysis around a dramatic narrative of a seven-night, 155-mile march she took with a platoon of guerillas. The Maoist movement is rooted in disadvantaged Adivasi, or tribal, communities and led by educated, middle-class cadres from elsewhere in the country. Shah dismisses theories that peasants join insurgencies for economic benefits or for protection, emphasizing instead the emotional bonds the guerillas form with young Adivasis by treating them as equals. She balances her mostly favorable picture of the insurgency with accounts of how movement leaders insinuate themselves alongside bureaucrats and politicians into the informal economy of protection payoffs and illegal logging, how some guerillas join mercenary gangs that cooperate with the police, and how the movement’s Maoist doctrine on gender repression blinds it to the relatively egalitarian reality of Adivasi gender relations. Her recurring theme is the unending cycle of violence among exploitative landlords, the oppressed tribal people, and the military, whose frontline soldiers are also young Adivasis."
55,Special Duty: A History of the Japanese Intelligence Community,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2019-10-15/special-duty-history-japanese-intelligence-community,Special Duty: A History of the Japanese Intelligence Community,"In the early twentieth century, adventurous Japanese businessmen, diplomats, and military officers produced on-the-ground information that helped Japan defeat Russia and invade China. But Japanese intelligence gathering went into decline thereafter. Military domination of intelligence work fostered groupthink, which led to spectacular mistakes, such as underestimating the U.S. response to the attack on Pearl Harbor. After World War II, Japan’s intelligence agencies suffered from weak public support, turf battles, a failure to share information, and constant leaking. With the end of the Cold War, the rise of China, the growing threat from North Korea, and the relative decline of U.S. power, a series of Japanese prime ministers started strengthening the system. They tightened classification rules, invested in cybersecurity, and established the Defense Intelligence Headquarters and, later, the National Security Council to improve communication among agencies. This engrossing history of Japanese intelligence demonstrates how such changes have made Japan a better security partner for the United States while preparing the country to stand on its own if the U.S. security guarantee loses its credibility."
56,Two Books on China,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2019-10-15/two-books-china,Two Books on China,"A contentious struggle between reformers and conservatives marked Chinese politics in the first decade of Deng Xiaoping’s reforms. That battle seemed to have disappeared after the 1989 Tiananmen crackdown, but in fact it had migrated from politics to intellectual life. As the post-Deng leadership was busy shrinking the role of state-owned enterprises and pushing China deeper into the global trading economy, intellectuals on the left used academic conferences and the Internet to mount critiques of neoliberalism and globalization, arguing that these policies coddled capitalists, hurt workers, and sold out China’s sovereignty. Although some leftists called for a “second Cultural Revolution,” they did not use violence, as the Red Guards had done in an earlier era. But they shared with the Red Guards the same veneration of Mao Zedong as the avatar of an egalitarian, anti-Western development model. With his rich description of personalities and issues, Blanchette brings these sometimes windy debates to life, revealing a little-known inner script of Chinese politics."

Chan, the founding dean of the University of London’s School of Oriental and African Studies, dismisses the notion that violent jihadism feeds off poverty and marginalization. Rather, jihadism draws from a line of reasoning that is “modernist” and poses a stark alternative to liberal globalization. Chan dips in and out of brief sketches of influential thinkers (including the medieval Sunni theologian Ibn Taymiyyah and the twentieth-century writer and activist Sayyid Qutb); he selects them based on the number of clicks each figure gets in Internet searches. He undermines some of his argument by conceding that contemporary jihadis don’t always read these thinkers. The author outlines the 12 steps that lead to the online recruitment of jihadis, but he offers no evidence that this method is especially prevalent or important. Chan’s argument can be a bit hard to follow, but it has at least two major implications: only those capable of speaking within the ideological terms of jihadis can counter their appeal, and counterterrorism strategists must consider using the Internet in ways they have not yet tried."

The author is a British Iranian journalist who writes with the style of an insider. He riffs on the regime’s internal politics and traces the roles and decision-making of key players. Much of the book is devoted to Iran’s foreign policy, particularly in the Middle East. Abedin stresses that Iran’s relationship with Syria is no mere tactical alliance. To force Iran out of Syria is “an impossible task.” Syria is Iran’s only formal ally and the linchpin of Iran’s “axis of resistance,” an anti-U.S. and anti-Israeli alliance spanning Iran, Syria, Hezbollah in Lebanon, Iraqi militias, and the Houthis in Yemen. With or without nuclear weapons, Iran can project power through much of the Arab world. What it lacks in advanced weaponry it makes up for in granular knowledge of the region, experience fighting various kinds of wars, and superior intelligence gathering. Although Iranians are weary of sanctions, the government remains strong, and in the absence of an invasion by an outside power, regime change seems unlikely."
59,Hezbollah: Mobilization and Power,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2019-10-15/hezbollah-mobilization-and-power,Hezbollah: Mobilization and Power,"Daher considers how the Shiite militant group Hezbollah gained legitimacy through its resistance to Israeli incursions in Lebanon. Hezbollah went from strength to strength after Israel withdrew from southern Lebanon in 2000 and after its partial victory against an Israeli incursion in the summer of 2006. Her book was first published in French in 2014 and does not investigate how Hezbollah decided to go to war in Syria on behalf of Bashar al-Assad in 2011. It takes some mental gymnastics to see how Hezbollah’s role in Syria either mounts resistance to Israel or defends the territory of Lebanon. Daher has spent years in the Bekaa Valley close to Hezbollah strongholds. Her portrayal of the organization is rather sympathetic. The book’s strongest feature is its analysis of the charismatic appeal of Hezbollah’s secretary-general, Hassan Nasrallah. Daher’s superficial treatment of the organization’s finances—and the group’s consequent ability to eschew corruption and rent seeking—is less satisfying. The author refutes accusations of terrorism leveled at Hezbollah, particularly the findings of the international tribunal that investigated the 2005 assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri. She challenges the evidence that Hezbollah was behind this killing and other violent incidents."
60,Two Books on the Syrian Civil War,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2019-10-15/two-books-syrian-civil-war,Two Books on the Syrian Civil War,"These two books offer wildly contrasting portrayals of the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and the hugely destructive civil war that has raged in Syria since 2011. Dagher started reporting from Damascus for The Wall Street Journal in 2012. He interviewed key actors and dissidents, among them Manaf Tlass, once a close friend of the ruling Assad family. Manaf’s father was a regime stalwart, a longtime defense minister, and a key liaison between the Alawite Assads and the majority Sunni population of Syria. Manaf eventually defected from the regime after Assad brutally suppressed the largely Sunni opposition. Dagher tells a story of paranoia and unbridled violence. He is unequivocal in his condemnation of the Assad regime and catalogs the world’s acquiescence in the regime’s brutality, enabled in part by the focus on battling the Islamic State (or ISIS). Dagher interviewed some survivors of Assad’s torture centers, who afford hope for a better future, but otherwise, this book chronicles the triumph of evil."
61,Understanding Russia: The Challenges of Transformation,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2019-10-15/understanding-russia-challenges-transformation,Understanding Russia: The Challenges of Transformation,"Instead of rekindling Western powers’ historical fears of Russia, Laruelle and Radvanyi present the country as an “ambivalent” nation—part of a continuum of Western politics rather than an outlier. The authors skillfully place Russia’s 30-year transformation since the Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev’s perestroika reforms in the context of broader developments in Europe, North America, and elsewhere. This slim but wide-ranging volume comes at a crucial time, as growing domestic unrest tests Russian President Vladimir Putin’s 20-year rule and as opposition mounts to his repression of dissenting voices. At the same time, the book is also a forceful reminder that “Russia is much more than its president” and that understanding the country requires nuanced consideration that goes beyond merely analyzing Putin. The authors explain, for instance, how the Kremlin has channeled both nationalism and globalism in addressing a slew of Russia’s problems, including the disparities between urban and rural life and a persistent brain drain. Laruelle and Radvanyi argue that although Russia wants to advance an alternative to the current world order, its motivations are more complicated and less sinister than many Western pundits assert."
62,Vasily Grossman and the Soviet Century,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2019-10-15/vasily-grossman-and-soviet-century,Vasily Grossman and the Soviet Century,"Vasily Grossman was a humanist bearing witness to an inhuman age. The Russian writer’s dispatches from the Battle of Stalingrad described Red Army soldiers as freedom fighters facing down the fascist menace, and they cemented his literary fame. In 1944, Grossman was among the first to report on the Nazis’ Treblinka death camp. After the war, Grossman extended his lens to depict Stalin’s regime as a foe of humanity, as well. He went further still, taking aim at all the parties to the Cold War that were amassing weapons of mass destruction. Unfortunately, Grossman’s universal concerns take a back seat in Popoff’s biography, which presents the writer as a Western-style dissident in conflict with the Soviet state. Her account flattens Grossman’s complex humanism, in which progressive nineteenth-century traditions mixed with the pathos of the Soviet revolution and—later in his life—westernizing impulses. Drawing a straight line from the Stalinist past to the present, Popoff claims that Russia under Vladimir Putin is once more sidelining Grossman. But she makes no mention of a serialized production of his novel Life and Fate that aired on official Russian television in 2012 and garnered prizes and rave reviews. This book is a missed opportunity to more fully engage with a writer whose abiding moral concerns reached far beyond the Soviet Union and remain vital after the passing of the communist state."
63,The Russian Job: The Forgotten Story of How America Saved the Soviet Union From Ruin,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2019-10-15/russian-job-forgotten-story-how-america-saved-soviet-union-ruin,The Russian Job: The Forgotten Story of How America Saved the Soviet Union From Ruin,"By the early 1920s, the Bolsheviks had won an outright victory over their class enemies within Russia. But the devastation caused by the four years of civil war eventually forced them to turn for help to their class enemies abroad. Smith tells the story of how the American Relief Administration rescued Soviet Russia when it was struck by the worst famine Europe had ever known. Based on rich archival materials, his book focuses on a group of young Americans who set off for Russia, lured by the exotic and the unknown, and found themselves in the middle of a horrific tragedy. ARA members and the Soviets they hired operated in a vast territory where whole villages were dying of hunger, corpses were being left unburied along the roads, and reports of cannibalism were not uncommon. Rare photos included in the book lend Smith’s account an eerie vividness. During the two years the ARA spent there, it saved millions of lives in some 28,000 towns and villages by providing food, medical supplies, and disinfectants, as well as restoring hospitals, purifying water, and organizing mass inoculations. The ARA’s head, Herbert Hoover, believed that by rescuing Soviet Russia from hunger, the U.S. government could also rescue it from communism. He left deeply disappointed. But to the young Americans who staffed the ARA, the experience delivered an existential intensity that, once back home, they longed for but could never quite find again."
64,"An Impeccable Spy: Richard Sorge, Stalin’s Master Agent",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2019-10-15/impeccable-spy-richard-sorge-stalins-master-agent,"An Impeccable Spy: Richard Sorge, Stalin’s Master Agent","Richard Sorge was a German enraptured with communism. In 1929, he became a Soviet spy in the Far East. Operating in Japan from 1933 until his arrest in late 1941, Sorge became a close adviser to the German ambassador in Tokyo and built a formidable espionage machine at a time when all foreigners were under close scrutiny from Japanese authorities. Sorge’s main mission was to find out whether Japan was planning to attack the Soviet Union. But his most famous report was one that warned of Germany’s imminent invasion in 1941—a warning that was dismissed by his bosses, who were fearful of contradicting Stalin’s belief that Hitler would not breach the Nazi-Soviet Nonaggression Pact. Matthews’ meticulously researched book draws in particular on materials from Soviet intelligence archives that have never before been accessed by a Western historian. These documents show that, despite the vital intelligence he provided, the Soviets always regarded Sorge as a potential traitor. Matthews’ book is a spy thriller that doubles as an enthralling history of revolutionary Germany in the 1920s, Tokyo during the country’s prewar militarization, and Moscow in the 1930s, where Stalin’s mass terror consumed, among others, seven of Sorge’s military intelligence bosses."

Hence, his short and entertaining book tells readers more about Denis Diderot than about the Russian empress who invited the leading Enlightenment philosopher to St. Petersburg. When the 60-year-old Diderot arrived in Russia in 1773, it was the first time he had ventured far from home. He shared with other French philosophers of his time a view of Catherine the Great as the embodiment of enlightened despotism, a leader driven by a faith in reason and progress and dedicated to ensuring the happiness of her subjects. As the book makes clear, the philosopher initially seemed poised to realize his dream of playing mentor to the monarch. Catherine eagerly engaged in debates with Diderot. She was enthralled by his audacious thinking, and he respected her devotion to Enlightenment ideals. Mutual disenchantment was, of course, inevitable. Diderot eventually concluded that the concept of enlightened despotism was an oxymoron and that Catherine, alas, was merely a despot. Catherine, meanwhile, gradually came to see philosophers as useless, their writings paving the way to endless calamities. Sill, Zaretsky cannot help but admire Catherine and Diderot’s mutual affection, which their mutual disappointment did not diminish."
66,We Need to Talk About Putin,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2019-10-15/we-need-talk-about-putin,We Need to Talk About Putin,"Galeotti is an established authority on Russia’s criminal underworld and on the country’s formidable security service and other uniformed agencies. His new book, however, follows a trend among studies of Russia by seeking to explain what President Vladimir Putin really stands for. But unlike most such accounts, Galeotti’s manages to completely overturn the conventional wisdom. The result is easily the shrewdest and most insightful analysis yet of Putin’s policymaking. Putin is not a “cool genius,” Galeotti writes; rather, he is an opportunist without a master plan. His system is an “adhocracy,” in which lackeys do not receive direct instructions but instead rely on hints and guesses to determine what will please the boss. Putin is not a champion of conservatism; indeed, he holds no particular philosophy. There is one thing, however, Putin feels strongly about on a gut level: he is a patriot, committed to making outsiders treat Russia as a great power. Putin is not a kleptocrat, says Galeotti: wealth may be important to him, but the thing that drives him is power, not money. Some of Galeotti’s insights may not be new to close observers of Russia. But nonexperts will appreciate his brevity and his reader-friendly style."
67,Beyond Great Forces,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/middle-east/2019-10-15/beyond-great-forces,Beyond Great Forces,"History used to be told as the story of great men. Julius Caesar, Frederick the Great, George Washington, Napoléon Bonaparte, Adolf Hitler, Mao Zedong—individual leaders, both famous and infamous, were thought to drive events. But then it became fashionable to tell the same stories in terms of broader structural forces: raw calculations of national power, economic interdependence, or ideological waves. Leaders came to be seen as just vehicles for other, more important factors, their personalities and predilections essentially irrelevant. What mattered was not great men or women but great forces."
68,The Nonintervention Delusion,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/united-states/nonintervention-delusion,The Nonintervention Delusion,"As the casualties and financial costs of the United States’ Middle Eastern wars have mounted, Americans’ appetite for new interventions—and their commitment to existing ones—has understandably diminished. The conventional wisdom now holds that the next phase in the United States’ global life should be marked by military restraint, allowing Washington to focus on other pressing issues. This position seems to be one of the few principles uniting actors as diverse as foreign policy realists, progressives, nearly all of the presidential candidates in the 2020 Democratic primary, and President Donald Trump."

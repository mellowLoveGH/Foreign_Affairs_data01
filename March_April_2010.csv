It committed the United States to help defend Japan if Japan came under attack, and it provided bases and ports for U.S. armed forces in Japan. The agreement has endured through half a century of dramatic changes in world politics -- the Vietnam War, the collapse of the Soviet Union, the spread of nuclear weapons to North Korea, the rise of China -- and in spite of fierce trade disputes, exchanges of insults, and deep cultural and historical differences between the United States and Japan. This treaty has lasted longer than any other alliance between two great powers since the 1648 Peace of Westphalia."
1,Global Energy After the Crisis,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/world/global-energy-after-crisis,Global Energy After the Crisis,"Commercially traded energy is what classical economists used to call a ""basic good"": directly or indirectly, it enters the production of every other produced commodity or service. Nonrenewable fossil-fuel energy and nuclear energy are produced by first converting and then burning natural resources. Because these resources are finite and unevenly distributed, they seem to become increasingly hard to come by when global economic activity expands. The need to maintain regular access to them is the simple logic behind the concept of energy security. Recently, these traditional concerns have been exacerbated by another threat: the fear that the atmosphere's capacity to absorb carbon emissions caused by humans may be exhausted long before humans' capacity to find hydrocarbons in the earth's crust and burn them for energy is."
2,Becoming Zimbabwe: A History From the Pre-colonial Period to 2008,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2010-03-01/becoming-zimbabwe-history-pre-colonial-period-2008,Becoming Zimbabwe: A History From the Pre-colonial Period to 2008,"As Zimbabwe's political and economic collapse enters its second decade, this book summarizes the historical and structural factors that led to it. Western observers tend to blame Robert Mugabe's regime for the crisis, whereas the Zimbabwean scholars represented in this volume place it in a broader historical context (although they certainly do not exculpate the regime). In particular, the highly unequal distribution of arable land bequeathed by British colonialism, which left several thousand commercial white settler farmers in control of a hugely disproportionate share of the land, was a political and economic time bomb. The contributors could have devoted more space to the 1979 Lancaster House Agreement, which brought about majority rule but did little to defuse the land issue. Nor do they particularly probe the Mugabe regime's disastrous macroeconomic policies, which made impossible a level of economic growth that might have provided the regime with better choices. Still, they have written a balanced and informative introduction to Zimbabwe's troubled history. Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."
3,Overcoming Historical Injustices: Land Reconciliation in South Africa,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2010-03-01/overcoming-historical-injustices-land-reconciliation-south-africa,Overcoming Historical Injustices: Land Reconciliation in South Africa,"As Gibson's book reminds readers, land issues lie at the heart of racial politics in contemporary South Africa. Employing opinion surveys to investigate South African attitudes about land, Gibson finds that for black South Africans, the expropriation of ancestral lands remains the central feature of the hated apartheid state. They view the redistribution of territory as a necessary righting of historical wrongs. Most white South Africans, on the other hand, recognize that some land redistribution is inevitable but are enormously ambivalent about the redistribution process and concerned about how it might affect them and their property in the coming years. Given the powerful political symbolism attached to land ownership, it is perhaps unsurprising that Gibson's opinion surveys find that racial identities often trump individual self-interest when it comes to land; even black and white citizens who would be unaffected by land redistribution tend to take on the beliefs and prejudices of their respective racial groups.

4,The African Diaspora: A History Through Culture,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2010-03-01/african-diaspora-history-through-culture,The African Diaspora: A History Through Culture,"There are one billion Africans and people of African descent in the world. Manning's comprehensive history of the world's black population since the beginning of the fifteenth century focuses much of its attention on the slave trade and its effects on the countries in which slaves ended up. It is particularly informative on the organization of the slave trade and its economic effects in the New World, although it also has much to say about African slavery on the shores of the Indian Ocean and the Red Sea, the impact of the slave trade on Africa itself, and slavery's role in the emergence of a global black identity and culture. The book's thorough and well-documented history of slavery is perhaps more compelling than its more superficial review of the twentieth century, including the U.S. civil rights movement and African decolonization. But readers will be impressed by the book's breadth and the arresting parallels it draws between events and dynamics taking place thousands of miles apart.

Reyntjens has written a perceptive account of a war whose origins lie in the advanced decay of the Congolese state at the end of Mobutu's 32-year reign and in the ethnic conflict in neighboring Burundi and Rwanda. Reyntjens delineates the geopolitical motivations of the different players and the diplomatic and military relations between them. He has also included an excellent chapter on the negotiations, brokered by South Africa, that eventually ended the conflict. Throughout, Reyntjens stresses how the decisions of Paul Kagame's regime in neighboring Rwanda shaped each successive chapter of the conflict. And he sheds light on the support that Kagame received from the U.S. administrations of Bill Clinton and George W. Bush for actions that may have been justifiable in terms of Rwandan security concerns but almost certainly worsened the bloodshed in the Congo.

It is also a deeply perceptive chronicle of Uganda's troubled past that sheds much light on contemporary Africa. Eliphaz Laki, an administrative chief in rural southwestern Uganda, was executed because of his political opposition to the Idi Amin regime. His son's detective work led to the arrest and trial of three of the dictator's now-retired henchmen, although the state eventually dropped all charges against them due to the court's unwillingness to accept key evidence for technical reasons. Rice paints vivid portraits of the characters in this complex story and skillfully analyzes Uganda's dysfunctional ethnic politics, which helped undermine the country's political order in the 1960s -- and which still lurk just under the surface today. More broadly, this book is a wise meditation on memory, forgiveness, and loss in times of conflict.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

Schaffer, a retired U.S. ambassador with decades of experience in South Asia, has written an exemplary account of the United States' efforts over 60 years to settle, or at least manage, this problem. From 1948 to 1989, U.S. diplomacy fluctuated between engagement and quiescence. But in 1989, the outbreak of a serious insurgency in the Kashmir Valley-which has drawn or nearly drawn the nuclear-armed rivals India and Pakistan into open conflict on several occasions-made further U.S. disengagement untenable. Beginning with the presidency of George H. W. Bush, crisis management, rather than conflict resolution, became the chief challenge for U.S. diplomacy. As the title of this book suggests, however, even high-level U.S. engagement has brought only modest results. Nonetheless, Schaffer argues that the time is right for a fresh U.S. initiative to help resolve the Kashmir dispute, especially since the views of India and Pakistan on the terms of a potential settlement have grown closer. U.S. President Barack Obama probably believes he already has a full plate of foreign policy problems. But were he to succeed where 11 predecessors have failed, his Nobel Peace Prize would surely take on added luster.  Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

On the surface, the stories could not be more dissimilar. The government has failed to protect intellectual property rights, causing U.S. copyright, patent, and trademark holders (and Chinese companies, too) to lose billions of dollars a year. China's courts, administrative agencies, and local governments are too weak, corrupt, and inconsistent to stop piracy and counterfeiting. These flaws arise from the Chinese model of government, which concentrates power in the hands of local authorities. Only when outside pressure is brought to bear on central authorities does the signal go down through the hierarchy, leading to real progress. Through an exhaustive study of the many overlapping enforcement agencies, Dimitrov characterizes China's enforcement of intellectual property rights as high in volume but low in quality, because it lacks transparency, consistency, and fairness."
9,China and India: Prospects for Peace,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2010-03-01/china-and-india-prospects-peace,China and India: Prospects for Peace,"Relations between China and India have thawed since the beginning of this century, and there has been a lot of talk about common interests, especially on the Indian side. Holslag analyzes the forces that are drawing the two nations closer, such as growing trade and investment ties, ""road diplomacy"" (tacit cooperation on opening up transportation routes in places such as Myanmar and Nepal), and shared concerns over the unstable buffer states of Myanmar, Nepal, and Pakistan. But he also points out that the relationship remains dominated by long-standing conflicts of interest over borders, Tibet, naval power in the Indian Ocean, influence in Southeast Asia, and the nuclear balance. The public's image in each country of the other is negative, making strategic cooperation harder. Even if a much-discussed bilateral free-trade agreement were signed and the border issues settled, the two powers, Holslag argues, would continue to be opponents-a rivalry that could work to the United States' advantage in the region.

Garnaut's book is chiefly about why, Dobson's is chiefly about how, and the Strategic Asia volume examines the resulting strategic shift toward Asia. But all three works agree that the ensuing power shift need not cause alarm. According to Garnaut, a leading Australian economist and former ambassador to China, the financial crash merely accelerated a movement long under way toward a ""quadripolar"" power structure consisting of the United States, the EU, China, and India. He rejects the theory that a Chinese savings glut is to blame for the crisis, placing primary responsibility on weak U.S. regulation. And he counsels that it will take time to rebalance the Chinese economy toward more domestic consumption, although he acknowledges that both China and the West would have suffered less if Beijing had done more rebalancing before the crash. Nothing can stop future bubbles, he believes. But the consequences could be mitigated if the United States and China were to cooperate on macroeconomic policy next time."
11,Inside Nuclear South Asia,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2010-03-01/inside-nuclear-south-asia,Inside Nuclear South Asia,"In May 1998, India conducted a nuclear test that did little to advance the country's long-standing nuclear weapons program but did advertise its existence to the world. What explains the timing? Contributors to this volume emphasize the domestic political calculations of then Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, who, by ordering the blast and standing up to U.S. sanctions, strengthened his party and stabilized his coalition government. To be sure, the program itself is still best explained by India's desire to counterbalance Chinese and Pakistani capabilities and enhance its own international prestige. But after 1998, New Delhi continued to use bomb and missile tests to gain points domestically. Sagan also believes that the nuclear balance emboldened Pakistani adventurism in Kashmir and led to more confrontational Indian military mobilizations in response. Instead of the strategic stability that characterized U.S.-Soviet relations, he foresees nuclear weapons in South Asia beckoning the Pakistani military toward proactive use on a relatively short trigger and eroding India's policy of no first use. As nuclear weapons proliferate, this pessimistic model of how nuclear states interact, he argues, may become more common than Cold War-style nuclear peace.

12,The Cartoons That Shook the World,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2010-03-01/cartoons-shook-world,The Cartoons That Shook the World,"On September 30, 2005, the Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten, having invited 42 Danish cartoonists to draw the Prophet Muhammad ""as they see him,"" published the 12 cartoons submitted. Danish Muslims (who compose four percent of Denmark's population) protested, Muslim governments intervened diplomatically, Muslims boycotted Danish products, the cartoonists received death threats, and mobs sacked Danish embassies around the Middle East. Seeing this, other voices championed free speech and evoked the threat of an Islamicized Europe. Klausen, a Danish political scientist at Brandeis University, appraises with empathy and irony the characters and issues involved -- Danish officials whose ""tin ears"" prevented them from nipping the crisis in the bud, an Egyptian government that entered the fray for domestic reasons (to score points against the Muslim Brotherhood and fend off pro-democratic pressures), the diverse and changing history of European blasphemy laws, the complex reality of Muslim depictions of Muhammad, and even cameo appearances by such diverse figures as the Islamic scholar Yusuf al-Qaradawi, Pope Benedict XVI, and Salman Rushdie. Readers looking for the cartoons themselves will not find them here: Yale University Press, after consulting experts, obliged the author not to include them."

Pope chronicles his three decades covering the Middle East as a journalist in 18 short chapters (the last five of which concern the war in Iraq). His approach is introspective and autobiographical, linking each story to the people he met and the places he visited. A few themes recur: the West (especially the United States) has been egregiously bad in dealing with the Middle East; the Middle East is neither so good nor so bad as Western stereotypes depict it to be, just more complex; and the Western media is hobbled by ethnocentric ideas of what is newsworthy and by a pro-Israel bias.

Weeks of house arrest and questioning soon turned into months, capped by 105 days of solitary confinement in Tehran's notorious Evin Prison. There she faced almost daily interrogations intended to elicit a confession that her work at Washington's Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars was part of a diabolical U.S. plot to bring about a ""velvet revolution"" in Iran. Esfandiari was finally released in August 2007, after persistent public and private pressure from the outside world (including an appeal by her former Persian-language students at Princeton University) presumably convinced the Iranian regime that her continued imprisonment was a diplomatic liability. Her account of these trying eight months make for a powerful addition to the prisoner-as-pawn literature that, alas, remains all too common. Framing this prison story is a well-wrought and poignant memoir: Esfandiari tells of her parents, the Iran of her youth, and her journalistic and scholarly career.

15,The International Relations of the Persian Gulf,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2010-03-01/international-relations-persian-gulf,The International Relations of the Persian Gulf,"Gause sees the three big states of Iran, Iraq, and Saudi Arabia, together with the small states of Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates, as forming a distinct system of international relations in which the foreign policy of each country is shaped largely by its relations with the others (plus its relationship with a dominant outside actor). He demonstrates the workings of this distinctive system from the early 1970s to the present. Given that these four decades witnessed the British withdrawal from the Persian Gulf, the United States' ever-increasing involvement, the rise of Iran, and three wars, simply producing a clear and coherent account of the system at work would be an achievement. Gause accomplishes this and more. His organizing theme is the concern of all Persian Gulf states, great and small, for regime security, but he also treats other matters, from the role of oil to transnational issues. A long chapter that examines why the United States invaded Iraq in 2003 shows the strength of this book: with his deep knowledge of the region, careful scholarship, and judicious attitude, Gause offers consistently sound interpretations.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

Like its predecessor, this book is a heartwarming story of good deeds accomplished and in the works, told with an intimacy that makes the people and places presented come alive. As for the implications for U.S. foreign policy, these books may be seen as proposing a distinctive form of liberal interventionism: the United States should not get out of Afghanistan and Pakistan but get involved more effectively. Mortenson pounds the theme of small-scale nongovernmental organizations like his working closely with local leadership but also praises the U.S. military (which has consulted him) for being more responsive to his ideas than others in the U.S. government. Even if this may lead to greater U.S. involvement in Afghanistan -- ""books and bombs"" rather than ""books, not bombs"" -- this dedicated dreamer's story inspires hope that his brand of liberal interventionism is right for Afghanistan."

Indeed, this anthology does cover a lot of ground -- from traces of proto-Slavic civilization before recorded history to Vladimir Putin's recent innovations. The chapters heaviest on historiography will appeal to professional historians, one of the most impressive being Nancy Kollmann's synthesis of the work on the political culture of fifteenth- and sixteenth-century Muscovy. For others, the richness of Ilia Dorontchenkov's essay on Russian art (from the Middle Ages to modernism) and Richard Hellie's on the scope and nature of ""unfreedom"" in Russian history will be more rewarding. Elizabeth Wood's contribution on ""the woman question"" in the late imperial period reflects the innovative range of the collection.

One was the Soviet Union. The other was Czechoslovakia. Heimann offers a no-punches-pulled political history of Czechoslovakia's whole trajectory, from its concoction in 1918, through its interwar democratic years, to its partition and acceptance of fascism, its Nazi occupation, its turn to communism, and, ultimately, its partition once again. As Heimann says, over the course of an average person's lifetime, the country ""went through every kind of political regime, from military dictatorship to parliamentary democracy, and from Nazi colony to Soviet satellite."" For all the misery inflicted on Czechoslovakia by the outside world, she argues, its own political elites, particularly Czech and Slovak ones, made things worse with their disregard and, at times, abuse of other ethnic groups.

Engerman's chronicle of Sovietology in the United States focuses on the ties between the government and the academy -- the tension, as he says, between serving ""both Mars and Minerva."" The chapters on the field's formative postwar years and its tight links with the U.S. government are particularly valuable. The middle of the book is more a history of the development of the central disciplines that made up Soviet area studies (history, literature, economics, sociology, and political science) in the 1960s and early 1970s. The last part of the book -- on the Soviet Union's final decade -- largely abandons scholarly developments and shifts the focus to a handful of figures active in the public debates convulsing the U.S. political scene in the the 1980s. The more entertaining portion of the book for some will be its concluding survey of the intellectual food fight that erupted after the collapse of the Soviet Union over who had been more right all along. Engerman blames the ""fall"" of the experts on the fractious debate over the nature of the Soviet threat that erupted in the late 1970s and 1980s and the failure to predict the Soviet Union's demise -- not a verdict that does great justice to everything else that was happening in the diverse disciplines that make up the field.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

Darden sees the post-Soviet states as an ideal test case, because they began with similar characteristics and histories but nonetheless chose differently: some pursued a liberal course and joined the World Trade Organization; others, more insular integration projects, such as those within the Commonwealth of Independent States; still others, autarky. He finds the answer in the economic ideas of ruling elites. These ideas, he insists, are themselves causal, albeit contingent on complex political processes, and in an exceptionally painstaking theoretical exercise, he strives to show how this is so. International relations theorists will find the effort a genuine contribution to a key debate.

Ruud builds what is essentially a combined political biography of Ford and study of Leonid Brezhnev's Soviet Union around Ford's reporting and personal notes, interviews with Ford after his retirement, and his wife's unpublished memoir. So often do readers limit themselves to the memoirs and biographies of the key U.S. players that they overlook figures such as Ford -- however powerful their insights, however more accurate their analyses of Soviet impulses than those of U.S. observers, and however important their stories of the way Soviet leaders strove to maneuver U.S. allies.

Whether they were as high as he thinks or for the reasons he ascribes can be disputed, but there is much merit in his argument that the war laid bare the fundamental weaknesses in Europe's security arrangements. Many would also agree that the tragedy revealed U.S. and European leaders' myopic and reckless inattention to the gathering clouds of war. Fewer, however, would agree with his essentially Georgian view of the war's details, causes, and significance. Although Asmus is right that the Russians later offered fraudulent justifications for their actions, he fails to convince on his core claim -- that Moscow launched a premeditated war to thwart Georgia's NATO aspirations. This reads vastly too much into a story whose facts, as he acknowledges, are contested at almost every critical turn. Still, the reader will gain greatly from Asmus' many conversations with people on the Georgian side and from his detailed reconstruction of the events.

The answer, of course, is Cuba, and the answers to over 120 questions about the country are in this splendid primer. Answering each question in, on average, two pages, Sweig displays a talent for succinctness and clarity, as well as a subtle, deep knowledge of Cuban affairs. Her book covers Cuba before the 1959 revolution, during the Cold War, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, and from 2006, when Fidel Castro was rushed to the hospital and transferred power to his brother Raúl, onward. The post-1959 questions cover Cuban domestic affairs, U.S.-Cuban relations, and Cuba's role in the world. There are, thankfully, more questions about Cuba's domestic matters than about U.S.-Cuban relations: How did Cuban schools come to outperform those of every other Latin American country? How did a country best known in the 1950s for song and dance create the most combat-effective military of any communist regime? Did Cuban leaders really think that they could turn homosexuals into heterosexuals by sending them to all-male labor camps? How could the transfer of power from Fidel to Raúl occur uneventfully despite Washington's and Miami's implacable hostility? As promised, Sweig tells readers what, indeed, everyone needs to know.

Hemispheric Politics Meets Globalization,"Here is an accessible compilation of 17 lively essays by senior international relations theorists that describe how Latin American nations-ever more democratic, divided, and assertive-are interacting with one another and with the fast-changing global system. The scholars generally welcome the relative decline of U.S. influence in the region; some of them pin their hopes on ""U.S.-free"" subregional institutions and on an emerging Brazilian diplomacy that ostensibly fosters South American solidarity. Strong chapters on the Organization of American States assess its innovative democracy promotion and election monitoring, as well as its recent paralysis (but would not have predicted the OAS's unified, if unsuccessful, efforts to restore Manuel Zelaya to the presidency of Honduras). Thomas Legler offers a compelling description of the powerful and polarizing ""Chavez effect"" on the region's multilateral institutions and ideological discourse. Absent from this book is an informed, sympathetic assessment of U.S. policies, but various contributors are probably correct that the future of inter-American diplomacy lies in issue-specific clusters of interested parties.

Global surveys now shed light on age-old questions about ""the good life,"" even if, as Graham and Lora are careful to point out, there are many methodological imperfections. Chapter authors are similarly careful to qualify their findings as inputs that should inform policy debates but not necessarily drive policy choices. The book gives fascinating explanations for the oft-observed ""reform fatigue"" in Latin America and for the enduring pull of populism.

It also finds that the poor are sometimes happier than their low incomes would suggest, perhaps because of their low expectations and lack of information -- paradoxical perceptions that these social scientists would not want policymakers to abuse.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."
26,Accountability in Public Expenditures in Latin America and the Caribbean: Revitalizing Reforms in Financial Management and Procurement; Participatory Innovation and Representative Democracy in Latin America,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2010-03-01/accountability-public-expenditures-latin-america-and-caribbean,Accountability in Public Expenditures in Latin America and the Caribbean: Revitalizing Reforms in Financial Management and Procurement; Participatory Innovation and Representative Democracy in Latin America,"Now that democracy is the only legitimate game in town, how can Latin American societies fashion public institutions that are at once representative, participatory, and capable of delivering the goods? Here are two compact, smart books that address these critical challenges. Accountability in Public Expenditures in Latin America and the Caribbean begins with the credible premise that the nitty-gritty of public finance can enhance countries' democratic legitimacy and make them more competitive internationally. Drawing on World Bank surveys of ten countries, the authors find that the areas in which governments have made the most progress are achieving fiscal discipline and introducing computerized information-sharing systems. But the list of remaining challenges is long and includes a lack of trained professionals, mazes of incoherent regulations, and an excessive focus on legal procedures as opposed to outcomes. Fortunately, answers are readily available: countries can adopt global standards (as advanced, for example, by international professional associations and multilateral institutions) and follow the best practices of regional leaders (notably, Chile). The authors also call for independent oversight of the budgetary process -- whether through external audits, civil-society watchdogs, or capable legislative bodies."
27,Ugly Stories of the Peruvian Agrarian Reform,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2010-03-01/ugly-stories-peruvian-agrarian-reform,Ugly Stories of the Peruvian Agrarian Reform,"For centuries, in Peru, as elsewhere in Latin America, wealthy hacendados ruled with iron authority from their large estates while humble indigenous peasants kept their gazes fixed on the ground beneath their feet. This all changed in 1968, when the Peruvian military seized power, swiftly expropriated these estates, and converted them into agrarian cooperatives. Mayer, a Yale anthropologist of Peruvian ancestry, witnessed the agrarian reform firsthand and returned in the 1990s to plumb the memories of the participants: displaced landowners and their offspring, aging revolutionary peasants, and former union leaders. Their heart-wrenching stories express the shocks and thrills of mass social change -- and the inevitable disillusionments that set in as utopian dreams run into hard realities. Paradoxically, Mayer found that most of his interviewees were materially much better off than before the reform -- not only the peasant beneficiaries but also many of the expropriated landlords, who had become urban businesspeople, and the political activists, who now work for nongovernmental organizations on sustainable development.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

Shapiro and Witney argue that Europe's treatment of the United States is characterized by bad habits: knee-jerk solidarity, excessive deference, and instinctive submissiveness. They claim that the pushback should start in Afghanistan, where the EU countries matched the United States when it came to foreign aid and provided nearly 40 percent of the military forces through 2008 but let Washington call the shots. To be sure, the authors' argument reflects a U.S. perspective; military operations in Afghanistan and the Middle East are primarily for the United States, not Europe. When Europe's own interests are at stake -- on the issues of EU enlargement, Russia, and climate change, to name a few -- the continent has been remarkably united. Thus, one might read Shapiro and Witney's critique as a plea not for Europe to stand up to the United States but for Europe to rescue the United States from itself -- particularly when the sole superpower is irresolute (in Afghanistan), indifferent (toward Russia), or internally gridlocked (on the Israeli-Palestinian question).Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."
29,The Politics of Citizenship in Europe,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2010-03-01/politics-citizenship-europe,The Politics of Citizenship in Europe,"Right-wing rhetoric and unruly referendums in Europe can give the impression that Brussels is imposing common standards on the EU countries' citizenship policies. Nothing could be further from the truth. Rules concerning citizenship, particularly for immigrants from countries outside Europe, vary extraordinarily -- from the relatively liberal rules of France and Sweden to the exclusionary ones of Austria and Italy. (This large divergence is one reason why Brussels has almost no say in this area.) Howard sets out to explain these striking differences, finding that colonialism, despite its manifest cruelty and inequality, had the ironic consequence of spreading egalitarian sentiments in colonial powers. As a result, Belgium, France, and the United Kingdom tend to have liberal citizenship policies. These countries also made relatively early transitions to democracy, which further encouraged open-mindedness. Of those countries that were not colonial powers, those with left-wing or centrist governments (such as Germany and Sweden) have been more welcoming to immigrants, whereas those with powerful extreme right-wing parties (such as Austria, Denmark, and Italy) have remained closed. Of course, treating extreme right-wing activism as a cause of strict immigration policies begs the question of why some countries are subject to this sort of partisan mobilization. Howard's explanation is nonetheless a welcome first step beyond the usual stereotypes about Europe's immigration policies.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

Weisbrode retells the story from the bottom up, focusing on the diplomats in the State Department's European Bureau. Until recently, many of the bureau's members viewed themselves as more politically astute and culturally refined than average diplomats. Yet this carefully documented study reveals that they made their share of mistakes, from questioning EU integration to encouraging the United Kingdom to join the EU a few years later to promoting NATO's nuclear-armed Multilateral Force. Still, none of this mattered, because -- despite Weisbrode's effort to show the contrary -- the presidents, secretaries of state, ambassadors, and ""wise men"" determined policy after all. For over 50 years, they may have complained that Europe lacked unity, military might, and resolve, but they had no choice but to acknowledge Europe as the United States' most important and powerful ally.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

Pluralism and Pragmatism in a Secularist State,"Americans' conception of Islam in France is dominated by the specter of demographic or political apocalypse. Lurid jeremiads regularly ask, ""Will France become Islamic?"" Bowen, an anthropologist, demonstrates that this view is nonsense -- not just because Muslims constitute a tiny minority of the French population but also, and more important, because most Muslims in France seek to assimilate in ways that are secular, moderate, and peaceful. Polls suggest that the French are more optimistic than most Westerners about the assimilation of Muslims and that French Muslims are not especially committed to asserting their religious identity vis-à-vis the state. This book is not for people who think that headscarves, burqas, and the annulment of marriages to nonvirgins mark the beginning of the end for French civilization and Western civilization more generally. But it will be engaging to those who see these matters as complex social issues that pose difficult but ultimately surmountable challenges for Muslims and indigenous French alike. Bowen has prowled French streets, suburbs, and villages to investigate the subtle cultural accommodations that are emerging. In striking contrast to overwrought fear mongering, his scholarly reportage reveals a nation of real French people resolving everyday problems -- where to buy meat, how to get married -- and getting on with their lives."
32,Why NATO Endures,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2010-03-01/why-nato-endures,Why NATO Endures,"Most military alliances have tended to be temporary expedients, aimed at gaining short-term advantage or lulling potential enemies into complacency. NATO is different: it was designed from the start to be permanent and has endured for over 60 years. Thies, a political scientist, argues on the basis of case studies drawn mostly from the Cold War that two factors account for this staying power: the world's bipolar distribution of power in the second half of the twentieth century and the existence of a homogeneous political ideology among NATO's members. One wonders if Thies' explanation can be simplified further, since two decades after the Cold War, NATO lives on, even though bipolarity is gone. Perhaps the organization owes its staying power simply to the shared values and institutions of liberal democracy: Western governments are thus left with little to fight over and much to cooperate on. Why NATO Endures provides a useful reminder of NATO's essential stability in the face of deep fissures over many small issues. What might need to be explained are the policy writings of the 1990s and the first decade of this century that have heralded the collapse of an institution that shows no sign of disappearing."

Holton's biography is not without faults, however. His overeager attempts to burnish Adams' feminist credentials feel patronizing and forced, especially when he tendentiously dwells on her wish to keep and bequeath property in her own name. Fortunately, such lapses are rare enough that Holton's considerable biographical talents shine through: Adams and members of her circle emerge as rounded characters, and Holton is an admirable guide to their intellectual and political concerns. Even though private lives were less thoroughly documented in the eighteenth century than they are now, he gives his readers an unforgettable portrait of an American original.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

Yet U.S. President Barack Obama dominates the world stage as few historical figures have, and the United States appears destined to play a unique role in the international system for many decades to come. Schake, who is distinguished chair in international security studies at West Point, not only explains why this role appears to be so resilient; she also offers advice for extending the United States' run as the leading world power. Even though this collection was originally prepared for that usually forgettable genre -- advice to an incoming administration -- the lively analysis and sensible recommendations make it an important resource for anyone who agrees that U.S. power, not U.S. decline, is the true issue of the day.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

Undergraduates and bright high school students will find it accessible and inviting; lifelong scholars of the period will be challenged and engaged. Integrating intellectual and political history is one of Wood's great strengths, and this work gives ample scope to his distinctive talent. His discussion of the conflict over federal finances and of the Jeffersonians' fear that the Hamiltonians would bring back the British system of executive control (through the expansion of the government and the creation of a large public debt) is as clear and as thorough a treatment of this seminal episode as possible. This period saw some of the strangest and most radical policies ever adopted by the U.S. government -- especially President Thomas Jefferson's 1807 embargo, which cut off U.S. trade with Europe. Wood helps readers understand how such outlandish steps seemed necessary and practical to brilliant and experienced leaders. The book is a tour de force of scholarship and a gripping read."

Collins' account of the progress made on women's rights may be long on anecdote and short on analysis, but it is nevertheless a gripping and eminently readable account of a remarkable story. Younger readers will be astonished as they read Collins' descriptions of the world of the 1950s and 1960s, when both women and men assumed that systematic discrimination based on gender was natural and benign. Older readers will be reminded of how much has changed.

Through careful research and thoughtful analysis, Ninkovich demonstrates the ways in which U.S. leaders, with their country's own civil war behind them, set out to understand a world increasingly affected by their actions. Courageously tackling such volatile subjects as the racial and cultural attitudes of the United States in the nineteenth century and the sometimes alarming similarities to the accepted ideas of today, he repeatedly dismantles cheap stereotypes about U.S. intellectual history and replaces them with more useful and nuanced interpretations. Any student of the United States' international relations will find this book stimulating and helpful as an introduction to the assumptions and debates that governed U.S. foreign policy for 25 years. That democracy is fated to spread around the world, that other countries are rapidly becoming more like the United States (and welcome the process), that others perceive Americans as having a unique moral authority -- these ideas were as prevalent in the United States in the late nineteenth century as they are now.

This book is therefore valuable as a short guide to all activities that could possibly come under this heading-everything from disarming opponents with brute force to the painstakingly negotiated treaties between Russia and the United States. His range of examples is extraordinary: they include ritualistic tribal battles in New Guinea, which would stop at night because of ghosts or rain (lest hair or ornaments got wet). Since the book is both short and comprehensive, however, it is largely descriptive, which makes for a disappointing lack of comparative analysis of the merits and pitfalls of each method of arms control.

In a world of bad people and dangerous weapons, there is no room for complacency, but Mueller has found it anyway. Of course nuclear weapons are awful, but not that awful, he argues; perhaps the bomb has encouraged some caution in political leaders, but if it had never existed the world would be much the same; it would be best if there were no more nuclear proliferation, but what is in store will not necessarily be calamitous; a terrorist's bomb might be everybody's nightmare, but it is very difficult for nonstate actors to actually construct a workable weapon. In the end, Mueller's case for calm is less compelling than his case against willful exaggeration and institutionalized paranoia in nuclear debates, whether on the part of hawks or doves. He points out the waste of resources and scientific talent they involve, as well as the way they encourage unnecessary tensions, counterproductive policies, and pointless disarmament negotiations. As always with Mueller, this book is lively and provocative and a useful corrective to much of the mainstream consensus. There is, however, a tension at its heart: if nuclear weapons are so irrelevant, how can fear of them have had such damaging effects? It is impossible to extract the nuclear factor from the history of the past six decades. Whether or not a third world war would have been avoided without nuclear weapons, the prospect of nuclear war has influenced all aspects of international affairs, for better or worse.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

First to founder was the Office of Reconstruction and Humanitarian Assistance, led by Jay Garner, which lacked staff, resources, and authority. Then, the Coalition Provisional Authority failed. Headed by Paul Bremer, the CPA was far better endowed than ORHA, but it so alienated the Iraqis that after six months it had to work as quickly as possible to hand power back to an Iraqi government. Neither organization got good press. Although they made their own mistakes, ORHA and the CPA were both victims of the Pentagon's cavalier attitude toward postwar responsibilities. There were no coherent plans for establishing governance, providing security, or restoring public services."

Yet this thoroughly researched and always interesting book has earned its subtitle: it not only adds intriguing detail to the interplay between Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev in the 1980s and gives due recognition to the role of Margaret Thatcher and British intelligence; it also breaks new ground by getting inside the dark and obsessive parts of the Soviet military machine. The ""dead hand"" of the title was something akin to the Doomsday Machine dreamt up by the nuclear strategist Herman Kahn, in this case a device that would automatically launch missiles against the United States in the event that the Soviet leadership was taken out by a U.S. attack -- a scenario that was actively feared during the fevered early 1980s. As startling a project, because of its lingering effects, was the Soviet Union's work on biological weapons, which resulted in one catastrophic accident with anthrax in Sverdlovsk in 1979 and risked much worse. Hoffman describes the efforts to close down the program just as the Cold War was ending and implies that they never quite succeeded.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

The book sketches the sources of those gains and analyzes some of the national political factors that militate against realizing them. Trachtman, a professor of law at Tufts University, examines several measures to overcome these barriers. One is to impose a tax on migrants, whose revenue would be shared by both the source and the destination countries. This tax would cover part of the educational investments the source countries had made in the migrants and part of the fiscal demands they were expected to impose on their countries of destination (beyond what would be covered by the taxes they would have to pay there anyway). Another idea involves formal international agreements that would liberalize migration under stipulated conditions. Although the book goes into considerable detail about the treatment of migration under existing multilateral and bilateral agreements, including within the European Union, it does not evaluate the consequences of those agreements. To get the ball toward liberalization rolling, Trachtman sketches what an international agreement on migration might look like. Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

In particular, he recounts the hedge funds' ""play"" against the Hong Kong government's commitment to fix the exchange rate for the Hong Kong dollar to the U.S. dollar: the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's surprising and shrewd move to buy Hong Kong stocks that hedge funds and others had sold short imposed disciplinary losses on them and ultimately made money for the Hong Kong authorities. Sheng draws useful parallels between the financial crisis of 1997-98 and that of 2007-9 and provides mature and levelheaded guidance to financial regulators everywhere.

Each of history's many crises is unique, of course, but the book's central message is that all of them also have remarkably similar features and aftermaths -- and therefore that there is much of contemporary relevance in seemingly dated episodes.

Passenger traffic began to decline in rich countries in the 1920s, as cars provided stiff competition and governments neglected to modernize railroads.

The book addresses what some have argued was the Fed's role in creating the crisis, through both its sins of commission (maintaining an easy monetary policy into 2004) and its sins of omission (not regulating mortgage lending during the housing boom or seriously warning politicians and the public about its risks). Wessel also addresses the bold and unorthodox actions that the Fed took under Chair Ben Bernanke to deal with the crisis as it unfolded. Although In Fed We Trust focuses mainly on the United States, it also covers the cooperation of other central banks and the uncooperative role of the British government in the last-minute attempt to salvage Lehman Brothers -- which many observers regard as a grave fumble that turned an already serious problem into a near catastrophe. All this makes for a gripping tale."

Luttwak, who wrote a well-regarded history of the grand strategy of ancient Rome, thinks this is a mistake. In this exhaustive study, he shows how the rulers of the eastern half of the late Roman Empire were the true masters of the craft. Although the Byzantine Empire occupied a more vulnerable geographic position than its western counterpart, it lasted almost 1,000 years longer. Luttwak argues that the Byzantines survived by relying less on brute military power and more on allies, diplomacy, and the containment of their enemies. They were able, he claims, ""to generate disproportionate power from whatever military strength could be mustered, by combining it with the art of persuasion, guided by superior information."" The book makes this argument through fascinating chapters on religion and statecraft, envoys, dynastic marriages, and the Byzantine art of war, as well as through evocative details about weapons, military tactics, and taxes. Although the Byzantine Empire did not have a foreign minister, intelligence agencies, or theories of ""smart power,"" it certainly acted as if it did.

Understanding Sovereignty Disputes in the North,"Even though it will take years for the melting of the Arctic ice sheets to trigger widespread coastal flooding, other effects have already appeared: warming in the region has ignited a scramble by neighboring states for resources and ownership. Great-power politics has come to the North Pole. Byers, a Canadian scholar of international law, surveys the emerging lines of conflict, focusing on territorial and sovereignty disputes. Since the Arctic is a sea of frozen ice, no country will ""own"" its expanse. But as the ice melts, the neighboring states -- Canada, Denmark (which owns Greenland), Russia, and the United States -- are asserting their respective ""sovereignty rights."" Byers provides a primer on everything at stake: the promise of vast oil and gas deposits in the seabed below, the navigation rights of the Northwest Passage, the protection of endangered species, the preservation of Arctic indigenous communities, and the rising security issues associated with the newly exposed coastlines and seaways. Written with an eye toward Canadian policymakers, the book urges governments to not just settle claims of sovereignty but also articulate a common vision of an open and peaceful Arctic region.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

The volume makes some headway in distinguishing between various forms of empire -- tyrannical, totalitarian, hegemonic, democratic, and republican. Some authors reflect on the steps that Athens and Rome followed: the rise in power, the search for a peaceful order, and the transformation through war and ambition into brutal, overextended empires. Laurie Bagby examines how ancient Greece's direct democracy, by empowering its glory-seeking citizens, encouraged imperialism. Arthur Eckstein shows how the Roman Republic tried to contain militarism through laws and term limits, efforts that eventually broke down with the rise of Caesar. Susan Mattern provides perhaps the most useful lessons for the United States in her account of how Rome built an empire on more than just military might by working with existing institutions and constructing complex networks of alliances.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

Some scholars see a future of ""multiple modernities,"" in which Western liberal democracy will give way to divergent political and economic systems; others see universal forces pushing all societies toward liberalism. In this spirited manifesto, Ferris, a science journalist, argues that science and the rise of ""science societies"" are the fundamental drivers of liberty and democracy. Societies need science to advance, and science requires political openness. This, of course, is an old thesis, rooted in the Enlightenment conviction that knowledge, innovation, freedom, and social advancement go together. In this restatement, Ferris traces the dual scientific and democratic revolutions from their Renaissance, Enlightenment, and early modern origins to the titanic twentieth-century battles between the liberal democracies and their fascist and communist rivals. Ferris also explores the scientific orientation of the United States' founders, such as Thomas Jefferson and Benjamin Franklin, and its relevance to their constitutional thinking and their noble ""experiment"" of a new nation. The Science of Liberty is sweeping and provocative, even if many may still doubt that science can extinguish prejudices, parochialisms, and illiberal impulses."

Instead, it was a manifestation of Victorian-era ""imperial internationalism,"" an organizational and ideological extension of the British Empire. This provocative thesis is pursued through brief sketches of several League of Nations figures who reappeared during the drafting of the UN Charter, most notably Jan Smuts, a South African believer in white racial superiority, and Sir Alfred Zimmern, the leading British voice of liberal internationalism. They both belonged to a wider group of elites who were attempting to ""shore up a liberal world order that would be compatible with empire and Anglo-American hegemony."" As Mazower sees it, Smuts believed that the league would ensure ""white leadership of the world,"" act as an instrument for a ""global civilizing mission,"" and undergird British imperial leadership. That Smut appears again in the 1940s offering a draft preamble for what was to become the UN is evidence for Mazower that the body was shaped by the same imperial mindset. But contrary to Mazower's depiction, most scholars of the UN, starting with Inis Claude, have not glorified its birth and have in fact traced its lineage back to the league. And it is not clear that focusing on Smuts and Zimmern, as opposed to other participants, illuminates the ideas and convictions that fed the UN's founding. The UN Charter did, in the end, affirm racial equality, and similar aspirations were articulated in the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Dwelling on old figures from the era of the League of Nations also means missing the UN's evolution as the colonial rebellions of the 1950s and 1960s transformed the General Assembly into the voice of ""the global South."" Whether the UN functions well enough today is a question that hinges less on the old ideas of bygone British imperialists than on whether the great powers can work together.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."
52,Armistice Now,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/israel/2010-03-01/armistice-now,Armistice Now,"More than 16 years after the euphoria of the Oslo accords, the Israelis and the Palestinians have still not reached a final-status peace agreement. Indeed, the last decade has been dominated by setbacks -- the second intifada, which started in September 2000; Hamas' victory in the January 2006 Palestinian legislative elections; and then its military takeover of the Gaza Strip in June 2007 -- all of which have aggravated the conflict."
53,Empty Promises?,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2010-03-01/empty-promises,Empty Promises?,"After eight years of the Bush administration, with its torture of suspected terrorists and disregard for international law, Barack Obama's victory in the November 2008 U.S. presidential election seemed a breath of fresh air to human rights activists. Obama took office at a moment when the world desperately needed renewed U.S. leadership. In his inaugural address, Obama immediately signaled that, unlike Bush, he would reject as false ""the choice between our safety and our ideals."""
54,Frostbitten,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/review-essay/2010-03-01/frostbitten,Frostbitten,"As the years pass, the Cold War increasingly appears as an undifferentiated chunk of history that stretched across time and space, with a vast cast of characters and occasional moments of drama. It is presented as a curious concatenation of summits and negotiations, alliances and clients, spies and border posts, ideological dogmas and underground resistance, and a combination of arcane theories about deterrence and some nasty actual wars."
55,After Iran Gets the Bomb,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/persian-gulf/2010-02-22/after-iran-gets-bomb,After Iran Gets the Bomb,"The Islamic Republic of Iran is determined to become the world's tenth nuclear power. It is defying its international obligations and resisting concerted diplomatic pressure to stop it from enriching uranium. It has flouted several UN Security Council resolutions directing it to suspend enrichment and has refused to fully explain its nuclear activities to the International Atomic Energy Agency. Even a successful military strike against Iran's nuclear facilities would delay Iran's program by only a few years, and it would almost certainly harden Tehran's determination to go nuclear. The ongoing political unrest in Iran could topple the regime, leading to fundamental changes in Tehran's foreign policy and ending its pursuit of nuclear weapons. But that is an outcome that cannot be assumed. If Iran's nuclear program continues to progress at its current rate, Tehran could have the nuclear material needed to build a bomb before U.S. President Barack Obama's current term in office expires."

The treaty reforms EU institutions, making the organization more accountable to voters and enhancing its ability to address European and global challenges. Over the long term, the treaty may make the EU a more coherent international actor, thereby significantly affecting non-EU countries, including the United States."

India's weak and protected economy gave it little influence in global markets, and its nonaligned foreign policy caused periodic tension with Washington. When the United States did concentrate on India, it too often fixated on India's military rivalry with Pakistan."

Cole was a founder of the Hudson River School and one of the pioneers of nineteenth-century American landscape painting; in The Course of Empire, he beautifully captured a theory of imperial rise and fall to which most people remain in thrall to this day."

He soon backed up his words with deeds, making engagement with U.S. adversaries one of the new administration's priorities. During his first year in office, Obama pursued direct negotiations with Iran and North Korea over their nuclear programs. He sought to ""reset"" relations with Russia by searching for common ground on arms control, missile defense, and Afghanistan. He began scaling back economic sanctions against Cuba. And he put out diplomatic feelers to Myanmar (also called Burma) and Syria."

The troop increases and the proposed withdrawal starting date of July 2011 dominated the headlines, but in the long run the effects of what Obama called a ""civilian surge"" will be even more important."

0,The Dismal Kingdom,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/dismal-kingdom,The Dismal Kingdom,"Over the past 60 years, the United States has run what amounts to a natural experiment designed to answer a simple question: What happens when a government starts conducting its business in the foreign language of economists? After 1960, anyone who wanted to discuss almost any aspect of U.S. public policy—from how to make cars safer to whether to abolish the draft, from how to support the housing market to whether to regulate the financial sector—had to speak economics. Economists, the thinking went, promised expertise and fact-based analysis. They would bring scientific precision and rigor to government interventions."
1,Too Big to Prevail,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/world/too-big-prevail,Too Big to Prevail,"When executives at the biggest U.S. technology companies are confronted with the argument that they have grown too powerful and should be broken up, they have a ready response: breaking up Big Tech would open the way for Chinese dominance and thereby undermine U.S. national security. In a new era of great-power competition, the argument goes, the United States cannot afford to undercut superstar companies such as Amazon, Facebook, and Alphabet (the parent company of Google). Big as these companies are, constraints on them would simply allow Chinese behemoths to gain an edge, and the United States would stand no chance of winning the global artificial intelligence (AI) arms race. That technology executives would proffer these arguments is not surprising, but the position is gaining traction outside Silicon Valley; even Democratic politicians who have been critical of Big Tech, such as Representative Ro Khanna of California and Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, have expressed concerns along these lines."
2,How the Good War Went Bad,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/afghanistan/2020-02-10/how-good-war-went-bad,How the Good War Went Bad,"The United States has been fighting a war in Afghanistan for over 18 years. More than 2,300 U.S. military personnel have lost their lives there; more than 20,000 others have been wounded. At least half a million Afghans—government forces, Taliban fighters, and civilians—have been killed or wounded. Washington has spent close to $1 trillion on the war. Although the al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden is dead and no major attack on the U.S. homeland has been carried out by a terrorist group based in Afghanistan since 9/11, the United States has been unable to end the violence or hand off the war to the Afghan authorities, and the Afghan government cannot survive without U.S. military backing."
3,The Price of Primacy,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/afghanistan/2020-02-10/price-primacy,The Price of Primacy,"The collapse of the Soviet Union revealed the bankruptcy of international communism. In time, the absence of a Cold War foe also exposed the bankruptcy of Washington’s global ambitions. Freed from major challengers, the United States had an unprecedented chance to shape international politics according to its wishes. It could have chosen to live in harmony with the world, pulling back its armed forces and deploying them only for vital purposes. It could have helped build a world of peace, strengthening the laws and institutions that constrain war and that most other states welcome. From this foundation of security and goodwill, the United States could have exercised leadership on the already visible challenges ahead, including climate change and the concentration of ungoverned wealth."
4,Reality Check,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2020-02-10/reality-check,Reality Check,"For the past three decades, as the United States stood at the pinnacle of global power, U.S. leaders framed their foreign policy around a single question: What should the United States seek to achieve in the world? Buoyed by their victory in the Cold War and freed of powerful adversaries abroad, successive U.S. administrations forged an ambitious agenda: spreading liberalism and Western influence around the world, integrating China into the global economy, and transforming the politics of the Middle East."
5,Getting to Less,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/united-states/getting-less,Getting to Less,"On the question of how much to spend on national defense, as with so much else, Americans are divided. A Gallup poll taken in 2019 found that 25 percent of them think the United States spends too little on its military, 29 percent believe it spends too much, and 43 percent think it is spending about the right amount—a remarkable degree of incoherence for politicians trying to interpret the public’s will. President Donald Trump, having campaigned on a promise to “rebuild” the U.S. military, has touted the “billions and billions of dollars more” he has added to the Pentagon’s budget each year of his tenure. On the campaign trail, some Democratic candidates are moving in the opposite direction. To free up money for her health-care plan, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts has said she plans to slash defense spending. Likewise, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont has said that in order to “invest in the working families of this country and protect the most vulnerable,” the United States should put an end to “massive spending on a bloated military budget.”"
6,The Digital Dictators,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2020-02-06/digital-dictators,The Digital Dictators,"The Stasi, East Germany’s state security service, may have been one of the most pervasive secret police agencies that ever existed. It was infamous for its capacity to monitor individuals and control information flows. By 1989, it had almost 100,000 regular employees and, according to some accounts, between 500,000 and two million informants in a country with a population of about 16 million. Its sheer manpower and resources allowed it to permeate society and keep tabs on virtually every aspect of the lives of East German citizens. Thousands of agents worked to tap telephones, infiltrate underground political movements, and report on personal and familial relationships. Officers were even positioned at post offices to open letters and packages entering from or heading to noncommunist countries. For decades, the Stasi was a model for how a highly capable authoritarian regime could use repression to maintain control."
7,The New Spheres of Influence,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2020-02-10/new-spheres-influence,The New Spheres of Influence,"In the heady aftermath of the Cold War, American policymakers pronounced one of the fundamental concepts of geopolitics obsolete. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice described a new world “in which great power is defined not by spheres of influence . . . or the strong imposing their will on the weak.” Secretary of State Hillary Clinton declared that “the United States does not recognize spheres of influence.” Secretary of State John Kerry proclaimed that “the era of the Monroe Doctrine is over,” ending almost two centuries of the United States staking claim to its own sphere of influence in the Western Hemisphere."
8,Saving America’s Alliances,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2020-02-10/saving-americas-alliances,Saving America’s Alliances,"In his three years in office, U.S. President Donald Trump has aimed his trademark vitriol at a wide range of targets, both foreign and domestic. Perhaps the most consequential of these is the United States’ 70-year-old alliance system. The 45th president has balked at upholding the country’s NATO commitments, demanded massive increases in defense spending from such long-standing allies as Japan and South Korea, and suggested that underpaying allies should be left to fight their own wars with shared adversaries. Trump’s ire has been so relentless and damaging that U.S. allies in Asia and Europe now question the United States’ ability to restore itself as a credible security guarantor, even after a different president is in the White House."
9,Mean Streets,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/world/2020-02-10/mean-streets,Mean Streets,"Some causes of death have little trouble catching the public’s attention. Avian flu, Ebola, and Zika have dominated news cycles and prompted international travel advisories. Plane crashes interrupt broadcasts and lead to thorough government investigations. Cancer, heart disease, and HIV/AIDS now attract billions of dollars of research. But one of the biggest killers of all gets little attention from governments, the media, or the general public. Car crashes killed 1.35 million people in 2016—the last year for which World Health Organization data are available—a grisly 3,698 deaths a day. Traffic injuries are now the top killer of people aged five to 29 globally, outpacing any illness and exceeding the combined annual casualties of all of the world’s armed conflicts. And the toll continues to rise: it grew by 100,000 in just three years, from 2013 to 2016. This does not include the up to 50 million people who are hit and injured by motor vehicles each year, some grievously, but who nonetheless survive. The economic losses are estimated at three percent of global GDP."
10,The Epidemic of Despair,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2020-02-03/epidemic-despair,The Epidemic of Despair,"Since the mid-1990s, the United States has been suffering from an epidemic of “deaths of despair”—a term we coined in 2015 to describe fatalities caused by drug overdose, alcoholic liver disease, or suicide. The inexorable increase in these deaths, together with a slowdown and reversal in the long-standing reduction in deaths from heart disease, led to an astonishing development: life expectancy at birth for Americans declined for three consecutive years, from 2015 through 2017, something that had not happened since the influenza pandemic at the end of World War I."
11,Learning to Live With Despots,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/united-states/learning-live-despots,Learning to Live With Despots,"Throughout its history, the United States has oscillated between two foreign policies. One aims to remake other countries in the American image. The other regards the rest of the world as essentially beyond repair. According to the second vision, Washington should demonstrate the benefits of consolidated democracy—free and fair elections, a free press, the rule of law, the separation of powers, and an active civil society—but not seek to impose those things on other countries. The George W. Bush administration took the first approach. The Obama administration took the second, as has the Trump administration, choosing to avoid actively trying to promote freedom and democracy in other countries."
12,"Come Home, America?",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/issue-packages/come-home-america,What’s Inside,"Wealth and power breed ambition, in countries as in people. Nations on the rise dream big, dare greatly, and see failure as a challenge to be overcome. The same process works in reverse: nations on the wane scale back their ambitions, cut losses, and see failure as a portent to be heeded."
13,The Folly of Retrenchment,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/united-states/folly-retrenchment,The Folly of Retrenchment,"For seven decades, U.S. grand strategy was characterized by a bipartisan consensus on the United States’ global role. Although successive administrations had major disagreements over the details, Democrats and Republicans alike backed a system of alliances, the forward positioning of forces, a relatively open international economy, and, albeit imperfectly, the principles of freedom, human rights, and democracy. Today, that consensus has broken down."
14,Unfulfilled Promises: Latin America Today,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2020-02-11/unfulfilled-promises-latin-america-today,Unfulfilled Promises: Latin America Today,"This eclectic collection brings together leading scholars of economics, social policy, public security, and international relations in sketching the progress and frustrations of Latin American development. The contributors generally advocate incremental approaches that build on previous progress, rather than root-and-branch upheaval. The separate chapters advance sound, if at times exacting, policy recommendations: countries should diversify their higher-quality exports, raise their labor productivity, enlarge their fiscal capacity, target pockets of poverty, bolster their social safety nets to safeguard their emerging middle classes, make their governance and regulatory structures more effective and transparent, and adopt comprehensive crime-fighting strategies. The contributors underplay the overwhelming pressures of population growth and rapid urbanization in some parts of Latin America, as well as the growing aspirations of middle classes that current growth rates will not soon satisfy. In highlighting the shortcomings of Latin American development, some essays inadvertently feed the notion, employed by authoritarian demagogues, that the region’s “unfulfilled promises” are reason enough to dismantle open, democratic capitalist systems. Hard-pressed democratic governments will have to judiciously select their priorities, leaving a lot for future generations to accomplish."
15,Paths for Cuba: Reforming Communism in Comparative Perspective,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2020-02-11/paths-cuba-reforming-communism-comparative-perspective,Paths for Cuba: Reforming Communism in Comparative Perspective,"Revolutionary Cuba is ironically among the more static political systems on earth. To imagine what a new Cuba might eventually look like, the contributors to this thoughtful collection examine the factors that have driven change in other one-party authoritarian systems. They paint a rather melancholy picture. Cuba has some advantages: an educated and low-wage workforce, a capable state, and proximity to dynamic economies, nearby democracies, and a prosperous Cuban diaspora in the United States. But Cuba seems unlikely to follow the path of China and Vietnam, communist countries that found prosperity in opening up their closed markets. The economies of China and Vietnam only blossomed once elites agreed to programs of reform; Cuban conservatives have resisted even the most modest market-oriented measures. The relative success stories of formerly communist countries in eastern Europe demonstrate the benefit of having a historical tradition of democracy, an independent civil society, and, most important, the liberalizing influence of the European Union—all conditions largely absent from Cuba. The animosity of Washington doesn’t help: subject to prolonged U.S. hostility, many Cubans view liberal democracy and free-market capitalism with deep mistrust."
16,The Wily Country,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/review-essay/2020-02-11/wily-country,The Wily Country,"Not since the McCarthy era has Russia been so present in the American psyche and so close to the fevered core of American politics. But being present is not the same as being known. Russia’s recent ubiquity in U.S. politics has coincided with a precipitous decline in contact between the two countries: among diplomats (a result of U.S. efforts to isolate Russia for its misdeeds in Ukraine and elsewhere), among heads of state and political elites, among scholars, and among ordinary citizens. U.S. academic work on Russia has been steadily diminishing since the end of the Cold War. Very few Americans now learn the Russian language or study Russian history, and a great deal of U.S. journalism on Russia suffers from hyperbole, paranoia, and clichés."
17,Ghosts of Sheridan Circle: How a Washington Assassination Brought Pinochet’s Terror State to Justice,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2020-02-11/ghosts-sheridan-circle-how-washington-assassination-brought,Ghosts of Sheridan Circle: How a Washington Assassination Brought Pinochet’s Terror State to Justice,"On September 21, 1976, the secret police of the Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet assassinated Orlando Letelier, a former ambassador and a leader of the opposition in exile, and his colleague, Ronni Moffitt, in broad daylight on Embassy Row, in Washington, D.C. Drawing heavily on previously published accounts, McPherson retraces the many twists and turns of the lengthy joint U.S.-Chilean investigation to identify and prosecute the perpetrators. The brazen violation of American national sovereignty, McPherson argues, as much as the violation of human rights, shook the U.S. government. The Letelier case established important precedents in international human rights law. There are many heroes in this account, including tenacious U.S. government attorneys, alert U.S. diplomats, and dogged pro bono lawyers, but Letelier’s widow, Isabel, stands out for her intrepid, relentless activism. Arguably, the strong U.S. response served as a deterrent to other would-be political assassins: the killing of Letelier remains the only state-sponsored assassination of a foreign diplomat on U.S. soil."
18,Del centenario a los chilennials: 100 años de transformaciones y 25 tendencias que cambiaron Chile (From 1910 to the Chilennials: 100 Years of Transformations and 25 Trends That Changed Chile),https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2020-02-11/del-centenario-los-chilennials-100-anos-de-transformaciones-y-25,Del centenario a los chilennials: 100 años de transformaciones y 25 tendencias que cambiaron Chile (From 1910 to the Chilennials: 100 Years of Transformations and 25 Trends That Changed Chile),"A recent wave of antigovernment protests in Chile that called for more affordable public education and health care, greater economic mobility, and a more inclusive democracy was spearheaded by high school and university students—the chilennials (millennial Chileans) of this book’s title. But older generations reminded these young people that their current living standards are far superior to those of their grandparents. This timely, readable study documents Chile’s sweeping transformation over the last 100 years from a dirt poor, semifeudal agricultural society into a modern, educated, and urbanized nation. These days, Chileans compare themselves not to their Latin American neighbors but rather to the developed nations of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, of which Chile is a proud member. Dosque and Valente beseech their fellow Chileans to “feel very proud and thankful” for these achievements and for the century of social struggles that made them possible, even as they warn against complacency. The authors fear that a lack of appreciation for the nation’s history might lead to a misdiagnosis of its current troubles that could jeopardize hard-won progress. This valuable, persuasive text should be required reading in all Chilean high schools."
19,The Second American Revolution: The Civil War–Era Struggle Over Cuba and the Rebirth of the American Republic,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2020-02-11/second-american-revolution-civil-war-era-struggle-over-cuba-and,The Second American Revolution: The Civil War–Era Struggle Over Cuba and the Rebirth of the American Republic,"Drawing on existing scholarship, Downs argues that the era of Reconstruction that followed the U.S. Civil War amounted to a second foundational moment in the history of the United States, when the government in Washington employed military force and other measures to radically transform labor and property relations in the American South and fundamentally revise the U.S. Constitution. With graceful and forceful prose, Downs links the mid-nineteenth-century history of the United States to that of the broader Atlantic world—in particular, to Cuba and Mexico in their struggles against European powers to end slavery and establish anti-imperialist democracies. The U.S. example was powerful, spreading revolutionary impulses and promising, however briefly, to produce a network of “free-trading antislavery republics” on either side of the Atlantic. Extending his historical interpretations to today’s politics, Downs suggests that Americans could benefit from reexamining the bold measures of nineteenth-century Republicans: the carving out of new states, the passing of constitutional amendments, and the introduction of federal oversight of elections."
20,"Braver, Greener, Fairer: Memos to the EU Leadership, 2019–2024",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2020-02-11/braver-greener-fairer-memos-eu-leadership-2019-2024,"Braver, Greener, Fairer: Memos to the EU Leadership, 2019–2024","Every five years, the European Union elects a new parliament, appoints a new commission, and replaces the president of the council and its high representative for foreign policy. Traditionally, this turnover is also a moment for EU officials to establish new priorities and a budgetary framework to pay for them. Just such a transition is occurring now. In this collection, analysts from Bruegel, one of Brussels’s most respected think tanks, review 11 issues and offer concrete policy recommendations for EU leaders. Each chapter constitutes a concise memo to the relevant officials. There are limitations: the chapters focus almost exclusively on industrial regulation, financial and digital services, competition policy, and other economic matters, areas in which Bruegel specializes; foreign policy, migration, Russian subversion, homeland security, and other important issues go neglected. The market-oriented recommendations are too numerous and idealistic, focusing on what would increase aggregate welfare rather than what is politically viable. The writing is jargon laden. Nonetheless, those who seek a succinct overview of the EU's potential course of action over the next five years are unlikely to find a better starting point."
21,"The Tragedy of Property: Private Life, Ownership, and the Russian State",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2020-02-11/tragedy-property-private-life-ownership-and-russian-state,"The Tragedy of Property: Private Life, Ownership, and the Russian State","Trudolyubov traces the roots of what he sees as the tragedy of Russia: its failure to establish democratic institutions that would defend its citizens against the whims of their rulers. With concision and clarity, he blames Russia’s historical lack of robust property rights. Through much of Russian history, the ruler dispensed private property—and especially real estate—as a “privilege” to the upper class. In western Europe, by contrast, property rights emerged in the course of long social battles and were closely associated with the development of common law and the liberal tradition. Anxious to maintain the state’s unchallenged supremacy, Russian rulers at all times were wary of private property. The Bolsheviks outlawed it altogether; for decades, the state was the sole owner and distributor of all land and urban housing. Today’s Russians may own their apartments and have better opportunities for a private life than earlier generations, but the state retains discretionary power over large properties, and the threat of sudden redistribution remains. Although he draws a bleak picture, Trudolyubov finds some solace in the fact that Russia’s top leaders do not seek to reinstate across-the-board state ownership or return to a Soviet-style totalitarian past"
22,European Disintegration? The Politics of Crisis in the European Union,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2020-02-11/european-disintegration-politics-crisis-european-union,European Disintegration? The Politics of Crisis in the European Union,"Over the past decade, many observers have written about the four large crises facing the European Union: the economic instability of countries in the eurozone, Russian aggression toward Ukraine, mass migration, and Brexit. Of course, the EU has surmounted crises in the past, but Webber suggests that the breadth, depth, and length of these recent ones render them more threatening. This approachable textbook-style treatment of the topic summarizes existing research and compares EU responses in each area. It rejects the conventional view that EU policy grows out of managing the tension between the interdependence of member states and the domestic calculus of nationalist politicians. Instead, Webber argues, EU policies today mostly reflect the power of Germany and, in particular, the idiosyncratic beliefs and motivations of German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Although it is hard to deny that the leader of Europe’s most powerful country plays a critical role, one wonders if her actions are as separate from the broader forces shaping the EU as Webber seems to believe."
23,Two Memoirs About the Soviet Union,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2020-02-11/two-memoirs-about-soviet-union,Two Memoirs About the Soviet Union,"These two memoirs are both written by respected left-wing scholars of Russia, but they differ in the extent to which their authors immersed themselves in Russian life. Siegelbaum entered Columbia University in 1966 and chose to study the Soviet Union because of his communist leanings. His memoir reads like a bildungsroman: Siegelbaum describes his early years as a child of “a Red” (his father joined the U.S. Communist Party in 1939), his participation as a young Marxist in the 1967–68 student protests, and his subsequent development into a Russian labor historian schooled in Marxist theory. As labor history receded in importance, his somewhat reluctant shift toward cultural and material history proved fortunate: his history of the Soviet automobile was awarded two prestigious prizes. Siegelbaum’s memoir is also a chronicle of the trends and debates in his field from the 1970s until his retirement in 2018, with a special focus on the new research opportunities that followed the collapse of the Soviet Union, as archives were opened and collaboration with Russian colleagues became possible. Apart from Russian historians, informants, and landlords, however, Siegelbaum mentions almost no encounters with the people of contemporary Russia. A Russia that had “shed its Sovietness and other-worldness” apparently lost its attraction for him."
24,The Stuff of Soldiers: A History of the Red Army in World War II Through Objects,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2020-02-11/stuff-soldiers-history-red-army-world-war-ii-through-objects,The Stuff of Soldiers: A History of the Red Army in World War II Through Objects,"Schechter looks at the Great Patriotic War (as World War II is referred to in Russia) through Soviet soldiers’ everyday objects (spoons, spades, knapsacks, uniforms, weapons, war trophies), with the aid of their letters and diaries, wartime manuals, and postwar fiction and memoirs. With this original approach—in itself an amazing achievement given the immense literature in this historical field—Schechter uses the material culture of the Red Army to trace the makeover of Soviet life and politics brought about by the war. The story of pogony (shoulder boards) is a good example of Schechter’s nimble analysis. This feature of the military uniform was discarded initially as a trapping of the ancien régime, only to be reintroduced during World War II. In Schechter’s view, this shift illustrates the transformation of the Soviet Union from a project of global proletarian revolution into a nation drawing on its history in defending the motherland from a foreign enemy. For the many millions of Red Army soldiers of different cultures and nationalities, the everyday reliance on the same government-issued gear was a unifying experience, one that came to define the Soviet Union until its eventual implosion."
25,"After the Berlin Wall: Memory and the Making of the New Germany, 1989 to the Present",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2020-02-11/after-berlin-wall-memory-and-making-new-germany-1989-present,"After the Berlin Wall: Memory and the Making of the New Germany, 1989 to the Present","How should Germans feel about the Berlin Wall? During the Cold War, East German leaders insisted that it was a defensive and stabilizing barrier, whereas their counterparts in West Germany denounced it as a humanitarian outrage that revealed the bankruptcy of communist ideology. This carefully researched and superbly readable book explores the wall’s place in Germany’s collective memory. After 30 years, the events of 1989, seemingly so clear at the time, have become the subject of heated debate. Who in the East was responsible for the wall’s fall: Protesters on the streets of East Germany? Tens of thousands of their fellow citizens who snuck through the Hungarian border? The guards who opened the gates on their own? The top Communist politicians who refused to order a violent clampdown? Or the Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, who declined to back the government in Berlin? Today, the wall has become a contested political symbol. Critics of continuing economic disparities between eastern and western Germany see commemorations of the fall of the wall as opportunities to criticize the current order. Some in the former East Germany view Berlin’s current policy of blocking Mediterranean migrants, instituted after the Syrian refugee crisis of 2015, as evidence that stern international barriers are normal and legitimate."
26,The Siberian Dilemma,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2020-02-11/siberian-dilemma,The Siberian Dilemma,"Back in 1981, Smith’s mystery novel Gorky Park, set in the contemporary Soviet Union, won him great success: it became a bestseller and was later made into a movie. Gorky Park’s protagonist, the criminal investigator Arkady Renko, has since proceeded to solve crimes in an ongoing series of novels that now take place in modern Russia. The Siberian Dilemma, the latest in this series, unfolds in 2019 and refers to real events, such as Russian President Vladimir Putin’s reelection the previous year. Renko, however, has not aged one bit and remains as astute and battle seasoned as ever. He faces a deadly dilemma as he finds himself personally implicated in the events he happens to be investigating, and he narrowly escapes death in the Siberian taiga. Those drawn to Smith’s mysterious Russian settings will be fully rewarded by the depictions of vast and cold Siberian expanses, monstrous bears, and precious sables (Smith appears to have a special feeling for the last: a sable-smuggling operation was central to the plot of Gorky Park), as well as small-time mobsters, big-time oil tycoons, dirty politics, banyas, and vodka. Russian readers, however, might smile at the book’s small cultural inaccuracies."
27,Learning From the Germans: Race and the Memory of Evil,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2020-02-11/learning-germans-race-and-memory-evil,Learning From the Germans: Race and the Memory of Evil,"Firmly convinced of the exceptional nature of their country, many Americans resist opportunities to learn from the history of others. They interrogate the history and legacy of American slavery, imperialism, genocide, and other mass evils without considering how other countries have dealt with similar misdeeds. Neiman, a Jewish American philosopher who grew up in the American South and now lives in Berlin, has written a corrective. She compares the German response to the Holocaust since World War II to the southern response to slavery and segregation in that same period. Both societies went through decades of denial: for 25 years after World War II, the Germans argued that everyday citizens neither knew about nor supported the Holocaust; American southerners during that same time maintained myths that slavery and segregation were beneficial and that the Civil War was really about states’ rights. Starting in the 1960s, however, Germany officially apologized, paid reparations, banned the glorification of the perpetrators of the Holocaust, and memorialized the victims. By contrast, Neiman argues, many southerners and their conservative defenders elsewhere in the United States continue to suppress the record of the past. They defend monuments and symbols celebrating those who took up arms to defend slavery, label official apologies as treasonous, resist reparations, and applaud politicians who employ coded racist language."
28,"Islam, Authoritarianism, and Underdevelopment: A Global and Historical Comparison",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2020-02-11/islam-authoritarianism-and-underdevelopment-global-and-historical,"Islam, Authoritarianism, and Underdevelopment: A Global and Historical Comparison","Kuru, a political scientist, undertakes an ambitious and, on balance, successful analysis of the ills of the authoritarianism, economic backwardness, and religious violence that plague 49 Muslim-majority states. He rejects the essentialist notion that the fault for the struggles of these states lies in Islamic doctrine, but he also dismisses apologias that point to the lingering effects of European colonial domination. Kuru traces a longer arc of decline. He describes a period of Islamic scientific and cultural efflorescence from roughly the eighth to the eleventh century, in which a dynamic mercantile bourgeoisie allied with a vibrant intelligentsia. That golden age came to an end thanks to the rise of a conservative and anti-intellectual alliance of religious scholars and state officials. Despite covering a vast amount of secondary literature, he does not adequately explain why the clergy failed to see the bourgeoisie as potential partners. He more convincingly makes the case that Muslim societies inherited the model of the powerful military-theocratic state—composed of warrior-rulers, religious authorities, and their subjects—from Persian tradition, not the Koran."
29,For the Record,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2020-02-11/record,For the Record,"Politics is an ugly game, and few who play it are self-reflective. So memoirs by leading politicians almost always disappoint. Even when they avoid outright lies, most mislead by omission, revealing little backroom maneuvering and evading personal responsibility for errors. This book is no exception: the former British prime minister, aware that history will remember him primarily for his disastrous choice to hold the ill-fated Brexit referendum, offers a retrospective self-justification. Throughout, he claims, unconvincingly, that his hands were tied. The referendum was inescapable because the eu had mistreated the United Kingdom and because sincerely Euroskeptical British citizens deserved to have their voices heard. Cameron denies that he was ever pressured by parliamentary backbenchers to hold the Brexit vote. The victory of the Leave campaign, he claims, was at once impossible to predict and inevitable, due to the lack of the EU’s willingness to reform; the perfidy of the then recently departed mayor of London, Boris Johnson; and the dynamics of modern media campaigns. Cameron comes across as a sincere and decent fellow severely lacking in the Machiavellian foresight, ruthlessness, and savvy required for political success."
30,The Brussels Effect: How the European Union Rules the World,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2020-02-11/brussels-effect-how-european-union-rules-world,The Brussels Effect: How the European Union Rules the World,"This may well be the single most important book on Europe’s global influence to appear in a decade. Many believe that Europe’s international standing is declining in a world dominated by China and the United States and in which the forces of globalization are creating a race to the bottom that undermines the European model of high regulation and social protection. Bradford demolishes these myths by showing how the European Union’s stringent regulations raise the standards of producers in China, the United States, and other countries across the globe. The EU manages to wield this influence by conditioning access to its market, the world’s second largest, on compliance with its standards. Bradford illustrates this “Brussels effect”—modeled on a similar “California effect,” which intensifies regulations within the United States—with detailed case studies of EU policies in a range of areas, including food safety, data privacy, and environmental protection. Farmers in Nebraska, for instance, grow pesticide-free products so that they meet EU standards. Globally integrated producers of goods as various as chemicals, automobiles, and banking services find that it often makes more business sense to produce just one product line to the highest standard in the world, which is, almost inevitably, that of Europe. Even big technology firms, such as Google and Microsoft, must toe the line of EU antitrust and cartel policy."

The tentacular reach of the Ministry of Defense into the economy is almost seven decades old, but its growth accelerated under the 30-year rule of Hosni Mubarak and has increased even more under President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, who came to power in 2013. The military may control as much as 20 percent of total public spending. At the same time, it is not subject to external audit or parliamentary oversight. It is a rent-making machine, controlling the commercial use of most of Egypt’s land. It imports and manufactures drugs and food staples, labeling these commodities as strategic. It has a bevy of private-sector allies. It is exempt from taxes and import duties on most of its activities. And it benefits from the silence of the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and the United States. All that can check its hold over the economy is its own drag on Egypt’s potential growth."
32,Crony Capitalism in the Middle East: Business and Politics From Liberalization to the Arab Spring,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2020-02-11/crony-capitalism-middle-east-business-and-politics-liberalization,Crony Capitalism in the Middle East: Business and Politics From Liberalization to the Arab Spring,"The contributors to this important collection parse the variety of crony-capitalist arrangements in the Middle East. They cover Egypt, Iran, Lebanon, Morocco, Tunisia, Turkey, and the Palestinian territories. The book proposes that the structural liberalization programs forced by international financial institutions and private creditors on the autocracies of the region in the 1980s and 1990s produced a grand bargain between political and business elites. Well-connected firms accepted limited market reforms in exchange for special benefits that boosted their profits. The authors contend that today’s autocrats have an inveterate suspicion of their own private sectors and fear that greater market reforms would shift power to assertive business elites. This hypothesis seems to fit the observed facts in the region, but there’s no evidence that the compromise was an explicit state strategy. Moreover, it is not clear why incumbent autocrats should fear their private sectors given how easily business interests were swept aside in the populist era of the 1950s and 1960s."

Bet-Shlimon was born in the United States but hails from an Assyrian family with roots in Kirkuk. The ancient, polyglot city was transformed in 1927 by the discovery of oil nearby. Kirkuk had long been dominated by its Turkish-speaking Turkmen population, but the oil boom drew in a large population of poor, rural Kurds to work in the oil fields. With them came Iraq’s Communist Party, which sought to organize the workers. The Iraq Petroleum Company helped build a middle class in the city but neglected the mostly Kurdish lower class. The 1958 revolution that toppled the Iraqi monarchy exposed the fault lines created during the oil era. Kurds and Turkmens chose opposite sides in Iraq’s national-level struggles. The rise of Saddam Hussein added the force of Arabization and anti-Kurdish animus to the volatile politics of the city. The book criticizes essentialist explanations of ethnicity, but the massacres that rocked Kirkuk in the late 1950s smack of visceral enmities. In this case, essentialist and contingent explanations can both be true."
34,Border Wars: Inside Trump’s Assault on Immigration,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2020-02-11/border-wars-inside-trumps-assault-immigration,Border Wars: Inside Trump’s Assault on Immigration,"Ever since a staffer hit on the idea of “build a fence” as a mnemonic to remind candidate Donald Trump to talk about immigration at his rallies, the groundwork was laid for immigration policy to become the “beating heart” of Trump’s presidency. The Muslim travel ban, the crackdown on undocumented immigrants, the cuts in the number of refugees accepted, the much-invoked wall, the inveighing against caravans of migrants, and the calculated cruelty of the family-separation policy have dominated news cycles for almost three years. Davis and Shear, New York Times reporters who have long covered these subjects, wisely saved much of their best material for this book. They have assembled here a view from within the White House, including through accounts of interactions with the president that verge on the surreal. Trump’s immigration policies stem from impulse, ignorance about substance and legality, deep bigotry, and—their saving grace—bureaucratic chaos and incredible ineptitude. The book reveals much about how Trump thinks, why he instinctively “grasped for the solution that looked toughest,” and, in hair-raising insider detail, how he governs from day to day. If journalism is the first draft of history, this volume is a solid second draft."

She does not tap new sources or make many new interpretations, but she compellingly mingles analysis of Shiite and Sunni doctrine and an examination of the political dynamics between the sects. Neither camp fully accepts the legitimacy of the other—although coexistence and cooperation have occurred, as in Mughal India. A major watershed was the advent of the Safavid dynasty in Persia in the sixteenth century, which wed Shiism to a geopolitical entity wedged between the Ottoman and Mughal empires. Ever since, the rivalry has become as much geopolitical as doctrinal and is more prone to militant and violent forms of confrontation (as exemplified by the evolution of Yemen’s Houthis, a Zaydi Shiite group)."

There, “Confederate ideology took on a new life.” An oligarchic economy emerged in the region, centered on mining, oil extraction, and railroads, which, like the cotton economy of the South, depended on lots of capital and masses of unskilled workers. In the late nineteenth century, the protections of the 14th Amendment (adopted in 1868) did not apply to Native Americans and were also interpreted in the West to exclude Chinese and other immigrants, leading to what effectively amounted to what Richardson terms “the shadow of legal slavery.” Forgetting the federal government’s role in giving land to homesteaders and investing in irrigation, so-called movement conservatives in the West embraced the myth that all a true American needed from the government was to be left alone. As reflected in Barry Goldwater’s Stetson and Ronald Reagan’s broad-brimmed hat, the free-roaming cowboy became the movement’s emblem."
37,Democracy in China: The Coming Crisis,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2020-02-11/democracy-china-coming-crisis,Democracy in China: The Coming Crisis,"There is a Chinese saying about the audacity of negotiating with a tiger for its pelt. In this closely argued book, Ci, a Hong Kong–based philosophy professor, embarks on a similar enterprise. He directs what he calls a “prudential” argument at the Chinese Communist Party: it should give up its dictatorship in order to save China from impending chaos. He argues that authoritarian rule no longer suits a Chinese society that is sophisticated, egalitarian, and dissatisfied with mere material comforts. In reaction to the spread of liberal values, the regime is cracking down harder, but this only accelerates the weakening of what Ci calls its “teleological-revolutionary legitimacy.” By his reckoning, even outstanding economic performance can keep the regime in power no more than another ten or 20 years before a major crisis will trigger its collapse. He says the party should get ahead of events by opening Chinese politics up to dissenting views—something liberals in China have hoped for ever since Mao Zedong’s death, only to be disappointed by each new leader. Ci offers shrewd insights into the contradictions in the party’s ideology, the mentality of China’s middle class, and the various ways the party sustains its legitimacy. But his argument is more philosophical than empirical: the book offers no assessment either of the level of popular support for the regime or of the looming challenges to the regime’s performance."

Treuer’s counternarrative is destined to last at least as long as Brown’s classic. Its story of resilience and cultural, economic, and political renaissance among native communities will be revelatory for most readers who are not Native American. Treuer, who grew up on an Ojibwe reservation in Minnesota, combines interviews, personal memoir, history, and literature to vividly trace the last 40 years of Native American history, including many positive developments. There is plenty of tragedy in the story of Native Americans’ relationship with the U.S. government, most of which stems from Washington’s various efforts to subdue or wipe out the tribes. But there are also glimmers of hope. For example, U.S. military service has provided a positive sense of belonging for many Native Americans, even though their heroism has often gone unrecognized. Continuing legal battles have righted some past wrongs. Treuer interweaves his analysis with intimate tales of “becoming Indian” in a context in which that identity can bring empowerment and personal success rather than victimization."
39,Last Days of the Mighty Mekong,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2020-02-11/last-days-mighty-mekong,Last Days of the Mighty Mekong,"Eyler’s vivid travelogue and elegy to the Mekong River explores the threats to the river’s diversity. The Mekong supports more fish species, more livelihoods, and more distinct ethnic groups than any other river system. But dams, roads, railways, and tourists are changing all that—so quickly that Eyler was able to observe the process of destruction personally during the 15 years in which he led study tours through the region. China is a prime driver of the changes, with its scores of upstream hydropower dams and swarms of newly rich tourists. But governments and developers all along the watercourse are scrambling to exploit its natural and social resources. It seems too late for them to repair the resulting damage: mass displacement, reduced fish catches, stunted agricultural yields, and the loss of local cultures as young people leave the highlands “to melt into emerging modern lifestyles.”"

Their understated description of Trump as conducting an “expressive presidency” doesn’t begin to do justice to the extent of his wrongdoing: his propensity to lie, his routinely unethical behavior, his devotion to the use of law enforcement as “an instrument of power against enemies,” and, tellingly, his refusal to endure scrutiny of his own conduct. Unfortunately, the authors’ discussion of the Nixon and Clinton impeachment processes and of the Mueller report does not compensate for the fact that the book was completed before Trump’s impeachment in December 2019. Still, the authors deliver a chilling analysis of the damage that has been done to the office of the president. Even if Congress can rouse itself to reinforce the separation of powers, the record of the past few years reveals that those powers of the presidency over which Congress has little or no jurisdiction—including the president’s independence in foreign policy and law enforcement, his power of the pardon, and his capacity to mislead the public—are immensely influential when abused by a president who does not take his oath of office sincerely. The authors dread a collapse of norms and the transformation of laws into “paper tigers.”"
41,China and Intervention at the UN Security Council: Reconciling Status,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2020-02-11/china-and-intervention-un-security-council-reconciling-status,China and Intervention at the UN Security Council: Reconciling Status,"Fung makes sense of China’s seemingly confused voting record at the UN Security Council on issues involving armed interventions and the referral of leaders to the International Criminal Court. In 2005, China used an abstention to allow a referral of the Sudanese leader Omar al-Bashir to the ICC, and in 2007, it voted for a peace-enforcement operation in Darfur; in 2011, it voted for an ICC referral of the Libyan leader Muammar al-Qaddafi and refrained from vetoing the no-fly zone that led to his fall from power. But between 2012 and 2014, China vetoed a series of resolutions that would have authorized interventions against Bashar al-Assad in Syria. What explains these carefully modulated choices, in Fung’s view, is Beijing’s effort to balance its commitment to the principle of sovereignty with its desire to play a major role on the international stage alongside Western powers while also maintaining solidarity with key regional actors, such as the African Union and the Arab League. She thinks that in the future, Beijing will mostly resist what it sees as Washington’s fetish for regime change. But her analysis also suggests that Beijing would more willingly authorize UN interventions if it saw them as serving its own interests instead of Washington’s."

Christopher Stevens, who between them held 14 ambassadorships and deputy chief of mission posts in the greater Middle East. They served mostly in war-torn states, such as Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya (where Stevens was killed in an attack on the U.S. mission in Benghazi in 2012), and Syria. Both the George W. Bush and the Obama administrations recognized the unique knowledge and abilities of these diplomats, asking them to return again and again to dangerous, chaotic situations in the region. The ambassadors practiced what Richter calls a “new diplomacy of the front lines,” working closely with their military counterparts. Even so, all four frequently had to decide whether to continue working in service of what they considered “disastrous policy blunders,” and as officials in Washington often ignored their advice. Richter embeds the stories of the four diplomats in a broader narrative that follows floundering U.S. policies in the Middle East. His book is at once inspiring, infuriating, and, as a chronicle of U.S. involvement in the region, deeply sad."
43,"Migration in the Time of Revolution: China, Indonesia, and the Cold War",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2020-02-11/migration-time-revolution-china-indonesia-and-cold-war,"Migration in the Time of Revolution: China, Indonesia, and the Cold War","This impressively researched study of Sino-Indonesian relations from 1945 to 1967 links three levels of diplomacy: state-to-state relations between China and Indonesia’s leftist leader Sukarno, party-to-party relations between the Chinese Communist Party and the Indonesian Communist Party, and the struggle between the rival regimes in Beijing and Taipei for influence over Indonesia’s ethnic Chinese community. Chinese and Indonesian archives show how Beijing and Jakarta cooperated in the fluid politics of the global anti-imperialist movement, siding in 1963–64 against what they viewed as a British imperialist plot to create Malaysia, a new state formed by the merger of Malaya, Sabah, Sarawak, and Singapore. The book dispels the myth that China directed the attempted coup in 1965 that led to the rise of the anticommunist strongman General Suharto, a break in Sino-Indonesian relations, and a massacre of suspected Communists, many of them ethnic Chinese. The Beijing-Taipei contest for influence in the ethnic Chinese community exacerbated the suspicion that the Chinese represented a fifth column. Throughout the turbulent politics of the time, Chinese Indonesians were victims of discrimination and violence, paradoxically accused both of capitalist exploitation and of pro-Beijing loyalties—suspicions that persist even today, when the two countries have full diplomatic and economic ties."

He shows how the group persevered and regrouped after both the U.S.-led invasion of Afghanistan in 2001 and the “surge” of U.S. troops in 2009, under the Obama administration. Based on many conversations with former and current members of the organization, this study is an important contribution to the history of the American-led war in Afghanistan. Giustozzi explores how the Taliban financed their campaigns, raised the morale of their members, and managed the tensions among a variety of distinct factions within the group."

Modi promised a foreign policy revolution, has gathered decision-making power to himself, and has traveled abroad more often than his predecessors. He has articulated a Hindu nationalist philosophy, promoting India as a “world guru” that can solve global problems with its civilizational wisdom of “happiness, peace, and harmony.” He has sought more foreign investment but still protected Indian manufacturers from foreign imports. And he has adopted a muscular security stance, building up naval and missile forces and responding forcefully to provocations from Pakistan. Identifying China as India’s main rival, Modi has tightened India’s strategic partnerships with other countries worried about China and sponsored infrastructure projects to prevent India’s South Asian neighbors from falling totally under Beijing’s economic influence. Hall acknowledges that Modi has brought his characteristic energy to promoting India as a major power but judges that the results have shown more continuity than change. India remains more protectionist than globalist, distrusted by its neighbors, and wary of aligning too clearly with other powers against China."

Under the Dear Leader (Kim Jong Il) and the current supreme leader (Kim Jong Un), North Korean architects over the past quarter century reversed an earlier trend of copying Soviet styles. The unfinished, 105-story Ryugyong Hotel is built in the shape of a rocket ship. The City of Sports complex boasts 12 huge buildings, each devoted to a particular game. The two-and-a-half-mile-long, 400-foot-wide Kwangbok Street is lined with 30- to 42-story residential towers, each built on one of seven designs. Every edifice, every cluster of buildings, and the city plan as a whole make ideological statements of fealty to the leader, national power, and ultra-modernity. Vast spaces and long vistas overwhelm the visitor’s sense of individuality. Pyongyang is designed as a people’s paradise—one with mostly empty streets."
47,China and Japan: Facing History,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2020-02-11/china-and-japan-facing-history,China and Japan: Facing History,"Vogel uses the powerful lens of the past to frame contemporary Chinese-Japanese relations. He does not begin with the horrors of World War II; instead, he takes the reader back over 1,500 years to examine the contentious dynamics that shaped how these two Asian giants view each other. With scholarly care and an eye on contemporary policy, Vogel suggests that over the centuries—across both the imperial and the modern eras—friction has always dominated their relations. China and Japan are now rich, powerful societies that were transformed both by Western imperialism and by the ravages of war in the twentieth century. But they have struggled to overcome past hostilities, in particular the memory of the Japanese invasion of China between 1937 and 1945. Vogel insists that the Chinese must better understand Japan’s unique strategic challenges and that the Japanese must better address China’s desire to right past wrongs. Asia’s future depends on their ability to build a more forgiving relationship."

With Germany on the edge of defeat and Soviet troops closing in, there was little strategic need for this exercise in destruction. But years of war had blunted moral sensibilities. The Royal Air Force embraced the doctrine of city bombing with the conviction that killing huge numbers of civilians was worthwhile if it brought the war to a speedier end. Dresden had a rich artistic and cosmopolitan heritage, but it had already lost its Jews to the Holocaust, and its dogmatic Nazi leadership was still committed to the war effort. In this evocative and poignant account, McKay describes the bombing and its aftermath through the experiences of many of those involved, including the writers Victor Klemperer and Kurt Vonnegut, who had recently been taken prisoner by the Germans in the Battle of the Bulge. McKay ends on a positive note, describing the reconstruction of the city and its more recent role in efforts at reconciliation."
49,Legislative Development in Africa: Politics and Postcolonial Legacies,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/legislative-development-africa-politics-and-postcolonial-legacies,Legislative Development in Africa: Politics and Postcolonial Legacies,"This fine study of the role that African legislatures play in promoting democracy and government accountability deserves to be widely read. Opalo’s well-informed general history of the development of legislatures in the region shows how the origins of parliaments in the waning days of colonial rule—as well as their evolution in the ensuing postcolonial authoritarian regimes—ensured their institutional weaknesses relative to the executive branch, an imbalance that continues in some countries. Two well-researched case studies in Kenya and Zambia offer contrasting examples of how an authoritarian past can produce different kinds of legislatures. In Kenya, the executive branch of the colonial and early postcolonial governments centralized power, granting the legislature only a modicum of procedural autonomy. But in the democratic era, the legislature has emerged as a relatively strong institution; being left to its own devices allowed it to develop organically over time. In Zambia, on the other hand, the regime micromanaged the legislature and thus prevented it from developing its own mechanisms of accommodation and compromise. The result in Zambia, Opalo argues, is a much weaker institution."

Moore avoids this trap in this useful survey of the army of workers who support the U.S. military. Private contractors maintain a global network of bases. In some cases, more foreign workers than U.S. military personnel are engaged in servicing U.S. military campaigns—four times as many in the later stages of the war in Afghanistan. Although mercenaries tend to be the focus of research on private contractors, only a relatively small number of these contractors serve in armed roles. Still, logistical work can be hazardous and deadly. Moore has undertaken detailed research, including interviews with workers, to explore the labor force buttressing the U.S. military. He traces patterns of recruitment (especially in Bosnia and the Philippines), finds evidence of exploitative and discriminatory labor practices, and explores how the military’s recruitment of legions of workers affects their countries of origin."
51,The Quality of Growth in Africa,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2020-02-11/quality-growth-africa,The Quality of Growth in Africa,"This solid collection of essays assesses sub-Saharan Africa’s economic performance during the last two decades. Recent growth has neither delivered adequate improvements in individual welfare nor produced more dynamism in African economies. The book’s best chapters carefully parse and interpret the recent growth record and its achievements. High commodity prices have played a big role in the region’s overall growth. Political instability helps explain the persistence of economic volatility. Although economic growth has had a real (if limited) impact on reducing poverty, it has also contributed to a rise in inequality. The authors lament the poor quality of the available data. One abiding puzzle remains Africa’s persistently high unemployment rates and the seeming failure of economic growth to produce more high-quality jobs, a problem several chapters link to the limited development of export-oriented manufacturing sectors in the region. The essays are weaker in their prescriptions; it may be right to call for more considered industrial policies, for example, but that suggestion is too vague and aspirational to be useful."

In some accounts, Dag Hammarskjold appears as a Machiavellian agent of the West; in others, he comes across as a noble idealist who tried to defend the interests of the less developed countries and facilitate decolonization. Melber, director emeritus of the Dag Hammarskjold Foundation, clearly agrees with the latter portrait and has produced a nuanced defense of Hammarskjold’s tenure at the UN. The core of the book is concerned with the 1960 UN intervention in the Republic of the Congo, launched to defend the new postcolonial government against Belgian-backed secessionists, and Hammarskjold’s death in a mysterious plane crash in 1961 in what is today Zambia. On the former, Melber argues that the secretary-general struggled to fulfill his ambition of carving out greater operational autonomy for both his office and the UN in general; by 1961, Hammarskjold’s prickly independence and sometimes sanctimonious eloquence made him useful to virtually none of the main actors in the process of decolonization in sub-Saharan Africa. Regarding the plane crash—about which there are many conspiracy theories—Melber’s summary of the multiple, inconclusive investigations breaks little new ground, but he suggests convincingly that forces hostile to decolonization, including southern African white settlers, caused the crash."

The administration’s stance has placed U.S. officials charged with preparing for future military contingencies in an absurd position. Thousands of military installations on U.S. soil are vulnerable to extreme weather events. Rising water levels and temperatures may have dire effects on key allies and aggravate conflicts within and between states. Klare has cleverly used the Pentagon’s continuing assessments of the impact of climate change and the military’s experience of dealing with its effects to illuminate not only the folly of denialism but also the seriousness of the potential climate threats. He traces a “ladder of escalation,” climbing from humanitarian disasters, to oil shocks, to disrupted supply chains, to collapsing states, to major-power conflicts (perhaps over water disputes). The book’s title is derived from a scenario in which the U.S. military must confront multiple warming-related crises abroad after fires and rising sea levels have immobilized it."
54,The Napoleonic Wars: A Global History,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2020-02-11/napoleonic-wars-global-history,The Napoleonic Wars: A Global History,"The regime that came to power in the wake of the French Revolution posed a unique threat to its rivals in Europe. Other European powers feared both its military strength and the spread of republican ideas. The epic struggle between France and its European competitors rocked the international system with constant warfare until 1815, when the British and the Prussians defeated Napoleon at Waterloo. The monarchies survived, and a sort of order emerged. Nonetheless, the repercussions of these wars were felt for the rest of the century. Most books on this period concentrate on the famous battles, from Austerlitz and Jena to Borodino and Waterloo, or on the figure of Napoleon himself, delving into his reformist politics and how he transformed the practice of war. Mikaberidze goes much further, providing vital context, illuminating the social and political forces unleashed by the revolution, revealing the impact of technological advances, and analyzing the complex interactions among domestic politics, commercial interests, alliance diplomacy, and imperial endeavors. The global consequences of the Napoleonic Wars—often neglected in such studies—also occupy much of the book. Mikaberidze shows, for instance, how Spain’s struggles affected its ability to hold on to its South American colonies and how the United States saw the chaos on the European continent as an opportunity to invade Canada. This is an extraordinary work of scholarship. Despite the book’s length, scope, and detail, the narrative never flags. It is hard to see how anyone will improve on this account."

In her analysis of the South Sudanese legal system, Ibreck claims with great optimism that insecurity and violence have pushed the population to depend on the law to improve its security and welfare. Her study of the South Sudanese legal system—and the small band of activists who work in sometimes extremely difficult conditions to support it—is often inspiring: what is taken for granted in peaceful countries becomes more explicitly important and worth fighting for in war-torn countries such as South Sudan. The book describes the workings of the country’s formal legal system and analyzes the largely failed attempts to put in place stronger legal mechanisms to protect individual rights. Enlivened by fascinating case studies, her book gives a voice to the lawyers, volunteers, and activists (such as herself) who, in tough circumstances, have tried to make the system work better for average citizens."

Bryce persuasively claims that world electricity demand will double between 2015 and 2040, despite big improvements in the efficiency of generating and distributing electric power. In his view, there is no way that climate change can be arrested by the use of renewable fuels alone. Nuclear power (along with natural gas) will be required if the world is serious about greatly slashing coal consumption."
57,Africa’s Totalitarian Temptation: The Evolution of Autocratic Regimes,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2020-02-11/africas-totalitarian-temptation-evolution-autocratic-regimes,Africa’s Totalitarian Temptation: The Evolution of Autocratic Regimes,"In a lively and wide-ranging study of authoritarianism in Africa, Peterson defines as “totalitarian” any regime that creates political institutions to dominate society, espouses an all-encompassing utopian ideology, and attempts to mobilize its citizens on a mass scale. He identifies three contemporary African countries as totalitarian (Eritrea, Ethiopia, and Rwanda) and another three as having strong totalitarian tendencies (Equatorial Guinea, Sudan, and Zimbabwe). The latter set of regimes are not viewed as totalitarian because they often have strong civil societies and, especially in the case of Zimbabwe, political oppositions. Informative chapters examine the evolution of each of these six states. Are these enough states to add up to a continental trend toward totalitarianism? Since the return of multiparty electoral politics in the early 1990s, the most typical kind of regime in Africa seems to be an electoral autocracy, a system that combines many authoritarian practices with regular elections. Peterson recognizes that this kind of system cannot be defined as totalitarian but argues that totalitarian tendencies continue to appeal to autocrats in the region. He worries that the developmental success of Ethiopia and Rwanda will make a harder-edged authoritarianism attractive to both international donors in search of economic efficiency and budding autocrats who wish to entrench their power."

The book’s title borrows the original motto of Google—now belied by its actual behavior, in the author’s view. Foroohar writes in an easy-to-read journalistic style, citing many speeches and interviews with numerous tech titans. She suggests a variety of ways to rein in the technology giants, including breaking up the firms (or at least limiting their growth), making clear that individuals (and not companies) own their personal data, and ensuring that highly profitable technology firms are properly taxed, mainly by closing egregious loopholes brought about and preserved by political lobbying."

He examines six familiar products—taco salad, automobiles (the Honda Odyssey incorporates the highest share of U.S. labor of any car), bananas (the most consumed fruit by far), iPhones, college education, and entertainment (especially the TV show Game of Thrones)—to demonstrate how foreign trade is a pervasive and invaluable part of modern life. He effectively debunks many myths about trade, including the misguided belief that bilateral trade deficits are harmful. His book is an easy and enjoyable read, drawing predominately on American examples but applicable to many other countries, as well."

This future is already apparent, in an incipient form. It involves the digitization of buying and selling (e-commerce), additive manufacturing (3D printing), the use of blockchain technology in various business practices, and the greater availability of credit thanks to direct lending by savers to borrowers. Such changes could enable small and medium-sized enterprises to engage in cross-border trade through e-commerce, in effect becoming mini-multinationals, a prospect of particular interest to the author. Suominen finds many inefficiencies in today’s outdated practices, which she believes can be overcome through international digital standards not only for e-commerce but also for customs processes and for digital services that transmit data across borders."
61,Good Economics for Hard Times,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2020-02-11/good-economics-hard-times,Good Economics for Hard Times,"This book, published shortly before the authors both won the Nobel Prize in Economics, in October 2019, covers a wide swath of structural and policy issues in both advanced and developing countries. They write that the discipline of economics has much to offer but that it needs to stretch well beyond the models that modern economists favor. They emphasize the importance of dignity for people from all walks of life, something the economics profession struggles to consider in its analysis. The authors’ own research is mainly in developing countries, especially India, where their observations are subtle and nuanced. Their analysis is less nuanced when it comes to rich countries but valuable nonetheless, particularly in making economics readily accessible to nonexperts through many stories and examples."

Stephen and Zurn argue that the current struggle over world order is unlike past great-power collisions, when the terms of the global order were decided in a contest between a rising power and a declining one. In this era, the global system is so densely institutionalized that competition is more complex and decentralized, with a multitude of states, international organizations, and transnational groups aligning and clashing over the reform of rules and regimes. In assessing the health of the liberal international order and the demands for reforming its old norms and institutions, the contributors focus on a wide variety of global institutions, including the World Trade Organization, the G-7, and the UN Human Rights Council. Stephen and Zurn conclude that the rise of China and other non-Western developing states has not sparked a clear-cut conflict over the fundamental principles of global order. Instead, a contest is underway in which states vie for authority and status primarily within specific international institutions. Rising states do not want to extinguish the liberal character of the global system as much as reform existing intergovernmental institutions to better advance and protect their societies and political regimes."
63,The Arc of Protection: Reforming the International Refugee Regime,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2020-02-11/arc-protection-reforming-international-refugee-regime,The Arc of Protection: Reforming the International Refugee Regime,"This short book takes a sobering look at today’s global refugee crisis and presents an ambitious agenda for action. A record 70 million refugees have fled conflicts in their homelands in recent decades. Most of these displaced people have crossed international borders and are now trapped in semipermanent camps or are seeking asylum in countries increasingly hostile to refugees. Aleinikoff and Zamore recognize a few positive developments, such as the 2018 Global Compact on Refugees, a UN agreement that calls for rich states and international financial institutions to provide more funding to those developing countries that predominantly shoulder the refugee burden. But they argue that the refugee regime is broken and propose sweeping reforms, starting with the expansion of refugee rights and protections. The keystone of their approach is the establishment of a global system of “responsibility sharing” that would be hammered out in a worldwide gathering of donor and host states, international organizations, and civil society groups. Aware of the political obstacles to such action, the authors argue that the first step would be to build consensus around the principles that must guide the global response to forced displacement—social justice, human solidarity, and proportional and fair contributions from outside powers."

Surveying dozens of military operations since the end of World War II, Henke shows that coalitions rarely emerge naturally in response to shared perceptions of threats, through a convergence of momentary interests, or from the coercive efforts of a hegemonic power. They need to be built by “pivotal states” that can overcome obstacles to collective action and orchestrate complex military operations. Henke looks closely at the coalition-building processes around the Korean War in the 1950s, the Australian-led operation in East Timor in 1999, the UN deployment in Darfur in 2007, and the EU interventions in Chad and the Central African Republic in 2008. Henke finds that building coalitions requires “embedded diplomacy”—a pivotal state’s complex array of institutional connections and networks of relations with other states—which creates ways for officials to make commitments, bargain, exchange information, and broaden the scope of negotiations to include other issues. Henke demonstrates the importance of diplomacy and leadership in building a successful coalition but does not try to determine in which circumstances the use of military force was (or would be) wise or just."
65,Worldmaking After Empire: The Rise and Fall of Self-Determination,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2020-02-11/worldmaking-after-empire-rise-and-fall-self-determination,Worldmaking After Empire: The Rise and Fall of Self-Determination,"In the mid-twentieth century, empires collapsed and postcolonial peoples around the world struggled for self-rule. In this important book, Getachew presents a sweeping new account of the global visions of the activists who led this charge. Scholars have typically seen the post-1945 decolonization movement as a story of nation building as postcolonial leaders in Africa and Asia embraced Western norms of sovereignty and self-determination. Looking closely at the political ideas of figures such as W. E. B. Du Bois, Kwame Nkrumah, Julius Nyerere, and Michael Manley, Getachew identifies a more revolutionary project aimed at pushing the world in a more egalitarian and anti-imperial direction. She explores this new thinking as it appeared in three domains—the push for self-determination at the United Nations, the building of pan-African and pan-Asian regional federations, and the calls to adopt the New International Economic Order (a trade agenda launched by some UN member states to bolster the interests of developing countries). In each instance, postcolonial leaders were not simply seeking to renegotiate relations between former imperial masters and newly liberated peoples. They offered a more far-reaching critique of prevailing geopolitical and racial hierarchies, emphasizing cosmopolitan solidarities and principled mechanisms for the redistribution of wealth and power. Getachew traces these ideas into the 1970s, when, in the face of a powerful Westphalian global order, anticolonial world-making gave way to more traditional political struggles that reinforced the nation-state."
66,The Light That Failed: Why the West Is Losing the Fight for Democracy,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2020-02-11/light-failed-why-west-losing-fight-democracy,The Light That Failed: Why the West Is Losing the Fight for Democracy,"In this original and deeply thought-provoking study, Krastev and Holmes argue that the retreat from liberal democracy in eastern Europe and elsewhere is rooted in liberalism’s post-1989 global triumph. With the collapse of communism, Western liberalism had no rival. U.S. unipolarity set the stage, and liberal democracy became an all-encompassing model of modernity. What followed was “copycat Westernization,” in which countries all over the world found themselves pressured to mimic the institutions, values, and ways of life of the United States and western Europe. In eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, this mimicry was all the more painful because these same countries had just been released from the ideological and institutional impositions of the Soviet era; now, they were again adopting the ideas and identities of a superpower, albeit under less duress. The result has been a deep and festering resentment in those societies, a collective “psychological stress” that has culminated in a widespread political backlash against liberalism. In Krastev and Holmes’s account, the right-wing politics coming to the fore in Hungary, Poland, and other postcommunist countries has less to do with the reassertion of primordial nationalist and illiberal identities than with a perceived need on the part of citizens in those places for independence, recognition, and dignity. The authors argue that, especially after the long wake of the 2008 financial crisis, Western defenders of liberal democracy need to offer a more realistic vision of world order, making room for alternative models while maintaining faith in the resilience of liberalism."
67,Why America Must Lead Again,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2020-01-23/why-america-must-lead-again,Why America Must Lead Again,"By nearly every measure, the credibility and influence of the United States in the world have diminished since President Barack Obama and I left office on January 20, 2017. President Donald Trump has belittled, undermined, and in some cases abandoned U.S. allies and partners. He has turned on our own intelligence professionals, diplomats, and troops. He has emboldened our adversaries and squandered our leverage to contend with national security challenges from North Korea to Iran, from Syria to Afghanistan to Venezuela, with practically nothing to show for it. He has launched ill-advised trade wars, against the United States’ friends and foes alike, that are hurting the American middle class. He has abdicated American leadership in mobilizing collective action to meet new threats, especially those unique to this century. Most profoundly, he has turned away from the democratic values that give strength to our nation and unify us as a people."

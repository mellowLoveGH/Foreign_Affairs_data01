They argue that this conflict can be divided into three broad categories. First, governments have waged war to divert attention from the various economic and political challenges facing them, such as when Eritrea attacked Ethiopia in 1998. Second, governments have started wars to pursue rebel forces in a neighboring country’s territory. For instance, in 1996, the Rwandan army invaded the Democratic Republic of the Congo to root out various Rwandan Hutu militias that had sought sanctuary in Congo after the 1994 Rwandan genocide. Finally, a third category of conflict consists of wars that have been motivated by what the authors call “national role conceptualization,” in which powerful states from outside Africa have assumed a military role on the continent. The authors place interventions by colonial powers in this category, as well as those of the Soviet Union and the United States during the Cold War."
1,African Peacekeeping,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2022-04-19/african-peacekeeping,African Peacekeeping,"Much has been published on international peacekeeping in Africa but very little on the role of African soldiers in peacekeeping operations there. Fisher and Wilén point out that three of the top ten and ten of the top 20 country contributors to UN peacekeeping operations around the world in 2021 were African. An insistence on “African solutions to African problems” in the 1990s led to a greater role for African troops in peacekeeping on the continent, typically subsidized by Western powers increasingly unwilling to put their own troops in harm’s way. The authors say little about the actual peacekeeping operations in which African troops have been involved and focus instead on how this involvement has shaped state building and Africa’s international relations. Fisher and Wilén argue compellingly that peace- keeping is attractive to many African states because it provides resources to the military, allows greater political control over the officer corps, and offers significant diplomatic dividends. An interesting historical chapter draws a parallel between the European colonial practice of shuttling African troops from colony to colony to quell instability and African peacekeeping missions today: that colonial legacy has “embed[ded] a distinctly undemocratic and unaccountable culture” in contemporary African militaries."
2,Two Books on Conflict in the Congo,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2022-04-19/two-books-conflict-congo,Two Books on Conflict in the Congo,"These two excellent ethnographic works probe the persistent civil conflicts in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Many recent investigations of contemporary civil wars in Africa have fixated on the role of mineral resources in motivating and financing combatant forces. Smith studies the mining and selling of so-called blood minerals, such as coltan, tin, and tungsten, but his account focuses on communities of artisanal miners, their practices, and their own complex understanding of the world in which they operate. Accusations by nongovernmental organizations that these minerals have sustained and exacerbated violence have led to measures such as the provision in the United States’ Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 that sought to ban resources from mining activities linked to local militias and warlords from global trading networks. Although the law did force the more egregious warlords out of the mining business, Smith argues convincingly that the next effect of this legislation was to close down the artisanal operations that benefited thousands of miners and their families and to allow big private companies, often in league with Congolese state actors, to take over the mines. Smith’s book is sometimes repetitive, but it is chock-full of fascinating details on the people and communities that have lived off mining in the chaos of the wars in Congo."
3,Until We Have Won Our Liberty: South Africa After Apartheid,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2022-04-19/until-we-have-won-our-liberty-south-africa-after-apartheid,Until We Have Won Our Liberty: South Africa After Apartheid,"Recent accounts of South Africa since the end of apartheid have rarely been flattering, focusing typically on the country’s slow economic growth, widening social inequality, and corruption. With a mixture of sober social science analysis and engaging personal travelogue, Lieberman defends the country’s record, particularly its ability to sustain for several decades a dynamic democracy with free and fair elections, a vibrant press, and an independent judiciary. He also ably documents South Africa’s achievements in improving education, housing, and public health, showing that, over the last 25 years, the country has mostly matched or surpassed the accomplishments of comparable upper-middle-income countries. Lieberman acknowledges the growing discontent among South Africans and notes that the white minority tends to be much more critical of the government than Black South Africans, even though the former’s position of relative privilege has largely been protected by the post- apartheid order. He writes lucidly about the economic and political shortcomings on which other accounts focus, but he makes an eloquent case for the remarkable progress South Africa has made in the wake of apartheid’s brutal legacy."

In a book that is part travelogue, part history, and part foreign policy analysis, he argues that China has long been a good neighbor to Nepal, allowing trade along the two countries’ Himalayan border, providing no-strings-attached aid for projects that diminished Nepal’s reliance on India, and building a road between Lhasa and Kathmandu to deepen relations between the countries. More recently, Nepal has signed on to China’s Belt and Road Initiative, Chinese President Xi Jinping has paid a state visit to Kathmandu, Chinese tourists and businesspeople have arrived in great numbers, and Nepalis have gained hope that China will construct a railway between Lhasa and Kathmandu. In return for Chinese support, Nepal sends Tibetans who cross into Nepal without permission back to the Chinese side and forbids resident Tibetans to mount anti-Chinese demonstrations. Nepalis view China as a better economic model and a richer source of funds than India. Mulmi warns that “India’s insecurities over losing its influence and primacy in Nepal and South Asia to China are well founded.”"
5,The Tiger Leading the Dragon: How Taiwan Propelled China’s Economic Rise,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2022-04-19/tiger-leading-dragon-how-taiwan-propelled-chinas-economic-rise,The Tiger Leading the Dragon: How Taiwan Propelled China’s Economic Rise,"After Taiwan’s labor costs rose in the 1980s and the island’s first democratically elected president lifted the ban on travel to China, many entrepreneurs moved their manufacturing operations to the mainland. They found a warm welcome from a Chinese government that was eager to foster its own export sector. Rigger insightfully relates the good and bad mainland experiences of various businesses, from umbrella manufacturers and bicycle makers to high-tech enterprises such as Foxconn, which produces most of the world’s iPhones; the computer maker Acer; and the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, which makes crucial high-end computer chips. She entertainingly describes how some Taiwanese firms created new markets in China for coffee, noodles, and bridal photos. The transfer of capital, technology, management skills, and international business connections helped the Taiwanese economy and contributed to a thaw in cross-strait relations but also strengthened China’s economy and its ability to put pressure on Taiwan. More recently, as mainland labor costs have risen and Taiwanese firms have faced tougher competition from mainland firms, many Taiwanese are moving their manufacturing operations elsewhere, some of them back to Taiwan itself."
6,City on the Edge: Hong Kong Under Chinese Rule,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2022-04-19/city-edge-hong-kong-under-chinese-rule,City on the Edge: Hong Kong Under Chinese Rule,"A Hong Kong native and distinguished sociologist, Hung offers a penetrating analysis of the city’s evolution from a politically neutral commercial gateway to China to a political community resisting mainland control. Over decades as a “super special free-trade zone” and a “cultural supermarket,” the city developed a distinctive way of life. Chinese authorities came to view this as a threat after many Hong Kong people—including some members of the Chinese Communist Party—supported the 1989 pro-democracy demonstrations in Beijing. From the 1990s on, mainland-linked financial elites increased their grip on the city’s economy and allied with local political elites to ensure loyalty to Beijing’s policies. Hung traces the parallel evolution of Beijing’s determination to make Hong Kong’s people accept assimilation into China and the local development of a proud, separate identity. The two forces clashed in a series of mass demonstrations in the 2010s, which ended with Beijing’s imposition of a draconian national security law in 2020. Hung insists that the struggle for the future of Hong Kong has not ended. But his analysis of how Hong Kong arrived at this bleak state is so persuasive that it doesn’t leave the reader with much hope."
7,Americans in China: Encounters With the People’s Republic,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2022-04-19/americans-china-encounters-peoples-republic,Americans in China: Encounters With the People’s Republic,"Americans’ encounters with China frequently produce a common narrative arc that bends from meeting to engagement to frustration, settling finally on a tenacious commitment to the relationship grounded in affection, curiosity, and hope. Lautz tells ten different versions of the story in readable, fully rounded portraits of U.S. politicians, diplomats, scholars, journalists, lawyers, and others who have devoted their lives to work involving China. These include the anticommunist Cold Warrior Walter Judd, the diplomat J. Stapleton Roy, the scholar Elizabeth Perry, the lawyer and human rights activist Jerome Cohen, the businesswoman Shirley Young, and the journalist Melinda Liu. There is something both hopeful and cautionary in these accounts, at a time when relations between the United States and China are at their lowest ebb in decades."
8,Retrofitting Leninism: Participation Without Democracy in China,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2022-04-19/retrofitting-leninism-participation-without-democracy-china,Retrofitting Leninism: Participation Without Democracy in China,"Gueorguiev offers perhaps the most thoughtful of a number of recent pathbreaking studies that describe the many ways Chinese citizens participate in politics within the limits set by the authoritarian regime. The government has opened websites for citizen complaints, petitions, tips about corruption, and comments on pending legislation. The authorities decide whether and when to respond with services, investigations into corruption, or revisions to draft legislation. Delegates to local people’s congresses are allowed to submit policy suggestions, which government agencies take more or less seriously depending in part on how many delegates add their signatures. Other modern authoritarian regimes have introduced similar practices, often taking advantage of digital technology. Gueorguiev argues that channels such as these help the regime fine-tune its policies and increase its legitimacy, while defusing dissent and preventing citizens from banding together against the authorities."
9,When the Iron Bird Flies: China’s Secret War in Tibet,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2022-04-19/when-iron-bird-flies-chinas-secret-war-tibet,When the Iron Bird Flies: China’s Secret War in Tibet,"Starting in the mid-1950s, the newly established Chinese communist government sent work teams to the Tibetan Plateau to attack religious and tribal leaders, redistribute land and livestock, and force farmers and herders into cooperatives. The teams faced resistance from farmers, herders, traders, and monks, who took up homemade muskets, rifles, knives, and spears to defend their traditional ways of life. The People’s Liberation Army responded by sending troops from seven of its 12 battle-hardened regional commands. The details of the ensuing war, which lasted from 1956 to 1962, have long been a closely held secret. Li draws on interviews with exiled Tibetans and on classified Chinese-language sources to describe battle after battle and the enormous destruction and loss of civilian life that the PLA caused. The “iron bird” of the title refers to bombers used to kill groups of herdspeople fleeing with their sheep and yaks and to obliterate monasteries where civilians ran for protection. The story is all the more heartbreaking for the clinical tone of Li’s reporting."
10,Infiltrating Society: The Thai Military’s Internal Security Affairs,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2022-04-19/infiltrating-society-thai-militarys-internal-security-affairs,Infiltrating Society: The Thai Military’s Internal Security Affairs,"It takes not just skill but also courage for a Thailand-based scholar to explain so clearly how the military has penetrated society in an effort to foster support for its conservative, royalist policies. Pawakapan traces the military’s “civil affairs projects” back to its counterinsurgency campaigns of the 1950s and 1960s against the Communist Party of Thailand. With the support of the revered king, Bhumibol Adulyadej, these efforts expanded even after the communist insurgency faded, justified by the theory that social and economic development were part of the military’s security mission. Road, water, forestry, and electric power projects, as well as vocational programs, were linked with military-sponsored mass organizations that carried out political surveillance, security patrols, royalist indoctrination, and occasional vigilante operations. Around the turn of the century, the palace and the army faced new threats—the rise of a populist movement that put Thaksin Shinawatra into office as prime minister in 2001 and the impending accession to the throne of the widely disliked crown prince, Maha Vajiralongkorn. (The army evicted Thaksin from office in a 2006 coup, and Vajiralongkorn became king in 2016.) The army reinvigorated its efforts to control Thai society through its associated mass organizations in a bid to protect the status quo. But Pawakapan doubts the military has actually succeeded in generating much popular support for a corrupt and inequitable system."
11,"Striking From the Margins: State,  Religion, and Devolution of Authority in the Middle East",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2022-04-19/striking-margins-state-religion-and-devolution-authority-middle,"Striking From the Margins: State,  Religion, and Devolution of Authority in the Middle East","This volume is the product of a twofold endeavor: the editors want to shed light on once marginalized actors who are becoming increasingly important as state authority in the Middle East erodes, and they hope to bring novel, sometimes overlooked perspectives to the conventional analysis of politics in the region. The simultaneous efforts to uncover the often obscured margins of politics and analysis are complicated, ambitious, and not entirely successful. An intimidatingly erudite introduction marshals Arab and European social theory to illuminate contemporary states, sects, and social movements. Later sections are more accessible, including a number of individual contributions that provide provocative and revealing analysis on issues as varied as the causes and consequences of Arab civil wars, the regional reach of private Gulf business conglomerates, the evolution of religious and sectarian affiliations in war-torn Iraq and Syria, and the role of external actors such as Russia and Turkey in the region. The contributors bring fresh outlooks to some of the most compelling questions of the moment."
12,Mohammed bin Salman: The Icarus of Saudi Arabia?,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2022-04-19/mohammed-bin-salman-icarus-saudi-arabia,Mohammed bin Salman: The Icarus of Saudi Arabia?,"Ottaway puts his decades of reporting on Saudi Arabia for The Washington Post to good use in sketching this portrait of the polarizing Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, who is widely known as MBS. Characterizing the 36-year-old as both a reflection and an advocate of change in the kingdom, Ottaway concedes that he did not anticipate MBS’s meteoric rise. Even more perplexing has been MBS’s apparent consolidation of personal power in a system long thought to be governed by painstaking consensus building within the royal family and lubricated by the generous distribution of the country’s oil wealth among its princes. As his book’s subtitle suggests, Ottaway suspects that MBS may be overreaching, especially in having ordered the brutal murder of the dissident Saudi journalist and Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi, but he admits that the prince has yet to pay any discernible price for his impulsiveness and brutality. Ottaway concludes by measuring MBS against a number of other ruthless Middle Eastern reformers, including Egypt’s Gamal Abdel Nasser and the last shah of Iran, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. But perhaps the most useful analog is one Ottaway does not cite: Muammar al-Qaddafi, the handsome young modernizer who overthrew the king of Libya in 1969. Ottaway’s discussion, particularly of the economy that powers the kingdom and empowers its rulers, is nonetheless brisk and useful."
13,Jordan and America: An Enduring Friendship,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2022-04-19/jordan-and-america-enduring-friendship,Jordan and America: An Enduring Friendship,"For all its importance as the Middle East’s keystone—the stone in the otherwise unsteady edifice that secures the other stones in place—Jordan does not get much attention. As Riedel shows, this is in part because many of its neighbors resent being held in place at all and have been eyeing the small desert territory covetously ever since its establishment in the 1920s. At various times, Iraq, Israel, Saudi Arabia, and Syria have claimed part or all of the kingdom’s territory as their own or as the rightful home of Palestine, whose people make up a majority of the country’s citizens. Riedel draws on his decades of experience in the CIA to lend color to his rehearsal of U.S. policy toward a monarchy that has served as a usually reliable ally, an occasionally useful scapegoat, and a consistent source of good and unheeded advice. Riedel’s genial account is sometimes surprisingly credulous; characterizing Jordan’s dependence on the United States as an “enduring friendship” seems charitable to all concerned, but he evidently enjoyed his own special relationships with the Hashemite kings, and this book is an appreciative salute."
14,Paradoxes of Care: Children and Global Medical Aid in Egypt,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2022-04-19/paradoxes-care-children-and-global-medical-aid-egypt,Paradoxes of Care: Children and Global Medical Aid in Egypt,"In its detailed ethnography of three nongovernmental organizations dedicated to providing medical care and health services to Egyptian children—street kids in Cairo, young girls in rural areas, and children at risk of abuse or in detention all over the country—Sweis illuminates both the global humanitarian industry and the lives of children in Egypt. Many of the employees of the organizations, both foreign and Egyptian, know full well that their day-to-day interventions are little more than stopgap measures; they are unable to cure the social ills they see around them and instead settle for alleviating individual suffering. In doing so, as Sweis reveals, they find that the humanitarian conception of such children as innocent, vulnerable, endangered, and deprived of a “universal youthfulness” is tested; the children these health workers treat are often far more knowing, sturdy, and self-confident than the adults around them. At least as important as creating mobile medical clinics or offering classes on healthy lifestyles, Sweis suggests, is addressing the poverty that devastates parents and children alike."
15,Fixing Stories: Local Newsmaking and International Media in Turkey and Syria,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2022-04-19/fixing-stories-local-newsmaking-and-international-media-turkey,Fixing Stories: Local Newsmaking and International Media in Turkey and Syria,"In this subtle and reflective book, Arjomand, a sociologist and sometime journalist, draws on both social theory and his own experience as a young Iranian American reporter and local fixer in Turkey over the last decade to examine the production of international news. He explores the tension between what is deemed newsworthy in foreign capitals and what matters to local residents and considers how journalists must navigate between the two. Arjomand’s principal focus, however, is the murky world of the fixer: the insider who translates, finds local sources, and otherwise assists foreign journalists. The fixer operates across multiple commitments, balancing political loyalties, career aspirations, and allegiances to friends and family, often shaping the stories that reporters file and that Western audiences read. Fixers usually toil in obscurity, unacknowledged by the media outlets whose work they make possible. Some of them chafe against this anonymity, but sometimes it works for them: they forgo the credit because they can’t afford the blame should local authorities take umbrage at a story. Arjomand uses novelistic techniques—composite characters in carefully composed circumstances—to both protect his sources and convey a complex and fascinating world with wit, intelligence, and sympathy."
16,Stalin’s Library: A Dictator and His Books,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2022-04-19/stalins-library-dictator-and-his-books,Stalin’s Library: A Dictator and His Books,"Roberts portrays Joseph Stalin, the mastermind and implementer of mass terror in the Soviet Union, as a voracious reader and meticulous editor. Based mostly on secondary sources, this book examines Stalin’s intellectual pursuits in the context of major episodes in Soviet history. The dictator’s personal collection of about 25,000 volumes was dispersed among various libraries after his death. Roberts traces the fate of those books and puts special focus on some 400 of them that bear Stalin’s personal markings. For instance, Stalin’s marginalia show how his view of Leon Trotsky evolved from admiration to vicious criticism. His annotations in the works of the Marxist philosopher Karl Kautsky include words such as “swine,” “liar,” and “fool.” Stalin’s main interests included history, Marxist revolutionary thought, and diplomacy. In fiction, his tastes were “conservative and conventional.” Stalin advised publishers, met with authors to discuss their work, and edited their drafts; he closely engaged in compiling a history textbook for schools and actively interfered in the ideological supervision of Soviet literature and film. Roberts characterizes Stalin as a dogmatic Marxist, yet Roberts’s own book contains examples of Stalin’s deviations from Marxist teachings. For instance, Stalin believed that the class struggle intensified under socialism, a view that clashed with Marxist theory but provided a rationale for new waves of repression."
17,God Save the USSR: Soviet Muslims and the Second World War,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2022-04-19/god-save-ussr-soviet-muslims-and-second-world-war,God Save the USSR: Soviet Muslims and the Second World War,"During World War II, the Soviet leader Joseph Stalin backed away from a policy of ruthlessly suppressing religion and adopted a more tolerant approach. Based on newly available sources in many languages, including Persian, Tatar, and Uzbek, Eden’s innovative study explores the dynamics of Muslim life in this period. One of Stalin’s goals was to inculcate patriotism among Muslim communities, whose sense of belonging to Soviet society remained tenuous. The new permissiveness included reopening mosques and empowering those Muslim leaders who had survived the prewar purges, while keeping religious life under tight state control. Religious leaders endorsed by the state presented the fight against Hitler as a holy war, blending Islamic devotion with Soviet patriotism. At the same time, the religious resurgence that the state’s tolerance unleashed thwarted the government’s attempts to keep devotional life within desired limits. Eden demonstrates the close connections between the world of state-sanctioned “official” Islam and that of “unofficial” Islam. He points to the resilience of grassroots religious practices that survived the violent prewar campaign of atheism, among other factors, to explain the government’s failure to prevent the spread of unofficial Islamic activities. Moreover, officials entrusted with overseeing religious life often lacked a clear understanding of what the policy of “controlled permissiveness” entailed."

This competition of historical memories became a grave obstacle to building a unified nation in Ukraine, where the different perceptions of the past sometimes worked to draw dividing lines between the country’s regions. The competition evolved into a confrontation and, after the uprising that unseated the Russian-backed president Viktor Yanukovych in 2014, gave rise to a forceful campaign to eradicate traces of the Soviet past, including the dismantling of Soviet monuments, the renaming of cities and towns, and the adoption of memory laws mandating “correct” assessments of historical events. The radical rejection of the Soviet past further alienated those constituencies that did not accept the Ukrainian ethnonationalist narrative and its heroes. The deepening divisions within Ukraine and repeated political crises made the country more vulnerable to Russia’s 2014 incursion, when Russia annexed Crimea and stoked a separatist insurgency in the eastern Donbas region. “The war over the past,” Kasianov writes, “can easily become the ideological basis for a real war.”"
19,Brezhnev: The Making of a Statesman,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2022-04-19/brezhnev-making-statesman,Brezhnev: The Making of a Statesman,"Schattenberg suspects that her biography of Leonid Brezhnev, the Soviet Union’s leader from 1964 to 1982, may be read as an apologia. Indeed, on too many occasions, she tends to give Brezhnev the benefit of the doubt. Her forgiving view is not always convincing. As a young functionary under Joseph Stalin, Brezhnev may have participated in the deportations of peasants and the brutal program of collectivization—as well as in the purges of his colleagues—but the author insists that “he simply fulfilled the tasks he was given” and did not show excessive zeal, as if that caveat would make him less complicit in these acts. Brezhnev discontinued the de-Stalinization policies pursued by his predecessor, Nikita Khrushchev, but Schattenberg claims that Brezhnev was only trying to appease hard-liners and that his reputation as an enabler of a creeping re-Stalinization of the Soviet Union is not deserved. The author admits that Brezhnev bears responsibility for the persecution of dissidents but emphasizes that he delegated this “dirty work” to the kgb and was not personally invested in repressing them. She repeatedly expresses sympathy for Brezhnev’s ill health (caused apparently by working too much) and brushes aside as a myth the notion that Brezhnev turned the Soviet Union into a bristling superpower. Brezhnev’s Soviet Union held half the world under its sway, but Schattenberg sees his true legacy as the pursuit of peaceful coexistence and disarmament."
20,Encanto,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2022-04-19/encanto,Encanto,"This blockbuster animated family musical takes place in an idyllic, rural, premodern Colombia. But the original soundtrack, by Lin-Manuel Miranda (including the hit song “We Don’t Talk About Bruno”), and the characters’ personal drama are decidedly contemporary. An ultrastrict matriarch rules over the multigenerational Madrigal family; the movie begins with the destruction of her town and the murder of her husband, violence that leaves her forever traumatized and fearful for her family. As displaced people, the Madrigals attribute their eventual triumphs to magical gifts. But their individual superpowers—extraordinary strength, the power to make flowers bloom, the ability to see the future, and so on—also suffocate their personal creativity. The resulting frustrations generate intrafamilial fractures, only resolved (spoiler alert!) when the matriarch recognizes that family ties built on love and community are more durable than those anchored in trepidation and isolation. To add notes of authenticity, Disney injects local flavors of Colombian cuisine, vibrant tapestries, and a racially diverse panoply of characters; the megastar Carlos Vives sings a celebratory ode to his native land and, by extension, to Latin America as a whole. If only the troubled region could enjoy some more Disney endings."
21,Education and the Future of Latin America,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2022-04-19/education-and-future-latin-america,Education and the Future of Latin America,"Analysts often blame the poor quality and uneven distribution of educational opportunities in Latin America for the region’s lackluster economic performance and enduring social inequalities. To investigate this correlation, Toledo, a scholar of education policy who served as president of Peru from 2001 to 2006, meticulously reviews the statistical evidence and professional literature to offer well-reasoned assessments of past reform efforts and cogent policy recommendations. He finds that access to education has expanded dramatically at all levels, even if the quality of education still requires substantial improvement. Toledo argues for big boosts in public investment, especially in poorer neighborhoods, as well as better salaries and training for teachers. But he also underscores that governments have to directly address poverty itself—characterized by inadequate nutrition, community violence, and resource-deprived households—if lower-income youth are to advance in large numbers. Toledo has an indigenous background and proposes that multiculturalism, mutual tolerance, and respect for others should be inculcated in schools. To realize such wide-reaching reforms, Toledo calls for visionary political leadership to build broad-based coalitions supported by the mobilization of concerned citizens."

Formerly an oil-rich, functioning democracy with a prosperous middle class, Venezuela today struggles with steep currency devaluations, severe shortages of food and medicines, debilitating power outages, and crippling urban crime. This is a cautionary tale of how unscrupulous authoritarian populists, drunk on ideology but driven primarily by the lust for power and its pecuniary rewards, can catastrophically ruin an economy and shred the social fabric of a country. Trapped in a polarized polity rife with vitriol, paranoia, and conspiracy theories, some of Neuman’s interviewees remain blindly loyal to their tormentors, many have fled into exile, and most simply struggle to survive from day to day. U.S. politicians come off poorly in this well-sourced account. Neuman reveals a Trump administration shockingly ill informed and reckless, its disastrous improvisations writing a distressingly dark chapter in inter-American relations."

The United States in Latin America, From 1776 to the Twenty-first Century","Crandall and Crandall briskly sketch 42 episodes of U.S. policy toward Latin America, ranging from the diverse reactions to the Haitian Revolution and the uprisings in South America led by Simón Bolívar in the early nineteenth century to contemporary efforts to bolster the region’s democratic reformers. The authors assiduously refuse to impose a formal theoretical framework or to accept simple explanations for U.S. actions. Rather, they find that a complex mixture of altruism, realpolitik, and the spillover of domestic politics lay behind Washington’s conduct, which was also shaped by the differing agendas and ambitions of individual presidents and diplomats. Far from being an all-powerful heg-emon, the United States repeatedly fell well short of its goals. Some apparently successful U.S. interventions (such as in Guatemala in 1954) backfired over time, but the authors do find enduring success stories. “The general commitment to the republican, democratic principles that first fired the wave of independence movements in the hemisphere has persisted through times of abeyance,” they claim optimistically. Responding to facile criticisms of U.S. policies, the authors reasonably question whether there were ever better, more workable alternatives. Still, the authors’ preference for balanced, nuanced assessments will frustrate some readers who might want more definitive judgments."

Shovlin, a historian, seeks to turn this conventional wisdom on its head—at least as regards France and Great Britain. He acknowledges the carnage of the War of the Spanish Succession, the War of the Polish Succession, the Seven Years’ War, the American Revolution, the Napoleonic Wars, and other conflicts. Yet he sees this period as also giving rise to global capitalism and the first flush of an alternative school of thought about global economic competition. He looks to figures such as the Scottish philosopher David Hume, the French philosophes and physiocrats, officials working for the British and French East India Companies, political economists such as Adam Smith, and some farsighted merchants and diplomats. Underlying their thinking lay trends that would eventually become irresistible, including the reform of domestic public finance, the growth of global capital markets, and the Industrial Revolution. The British and French states began to adopt free trade and capital movements for self-interested reasons—setting the stage for the well-known transformations of the nineteenth century."

In that time, they emerged from their duchy in northern France to lead a remarkably successful crusade to the Holy Land, establish a kingdom in Sicily and southern Italy that left some of the great religious monuments of the era, and, of course, conquer the British Isles. Legends abound of their exploits, which has given rise to a historical reputation of them as a master race of uniquely skilled warriors descended from the Vikings and favored by God. This book argues that they were, instead, lucky opportunists who took advantage of transient geopolitical power vacuums. The Roman Catholic Church was on the rise, military technology was changing, monarchs and bureaucrats were forging modern state administrations, and nobles were reviving large-scale architectural projects. It was a moment when a small and ruthless band of well-commanded fighters with siege technology and powerful ecclesiastical connections could make a mark—and the Normans were at the right place at the right time to benefit. Yet their triumph would be short-lived: within a century, larger European states and empires would copy their innovations and reconquer most of their lands."
26,Nazi Billionaires: The Dark History of Germany’s Wealthiest Dynasties,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2022-04-19/nazi-billionaires-dark-history-germanys-wealthiest-dynasties,Nazi Billionaires: The Dark History of Germany’s Wealthiest Dynasties,"Many German businesspeople supported the rise of Hitler, exploited forced labor during World War II, thrived in a Cold War West Germany that needed their skills and wealth, and passed on that wealth to new generations that prosper in Germany today. These include the owners of firms such as BMW, Daimler (then Daimler-Benz), IG Farben, Siemens, and ThyssenKrupp (formerly Krupp). De Jong, a journalist who specializes in such topics, provides a readable overview of this trajectory. Importantly, he underlines the decisive facilitating role that business interests often play in bringing populist authoritarians to power. Yet he seems unconcerned with this. Instead, he frames the book as a sensational and original investigation that shows that the Germans have not fully reckoned with their past. Nothing could be further from the truth. For three-quarters of a century, Germans have been debating the abiding prominence of private businesses that thrived under the Nazis and persisted in postwar Germany. These very companies have sponsored independent academic histories of their past. German high schools and universities teach this history routinely. Older generations of owners have been replaced by younger generations whose members support modern Germany’s relatively moderate, even pacific, foreign policy. If only the elites of other countries had so fully internalized the grim lessons of their history."

In this timely book, Olmsted focuses on the role played by the six most powerful media moguls in the United Kingdom and the United States, whose newspapers together reached a majority of their countries’ readers every day. All dismissed the fascist threat and called for appeasement, and some unashamedly embraced fascism, anti-Semitism, and xenophobia. Moreover, they spread a polemic, sensationalistic, and personalist style of news writing that often crossed the line into outright untruth—a power in which they reveled. In the United Kingdom, Lord Beaverbrook, who boasted that he ran newspapers “purely for the purpose of making propaganda,” called for isolation and appeasement. Lord Rothermere, who founded several British tabloids, praised Nazi Germany and fascist Italy as the “best run” countries in Europe, while secretly writing Hitler to encourage him to invade more countries. In the United States, William Randolph Hearst whitewashed Hitler’s actions, except when he criticized Nazi Germany for allying “with the yellow peril,” a racist way of describing Japan. Other leading U.S. publishers accused President Franklin Roosevelt of imperiling the U.S. Constitution and his Jewish advisers of running a foreign-directed conspiracy. This book reminds readers that nationalist press outlets that disseminate fake news, praise foreign autocrats, and practice dog-whistle politics are nothing new."
28,Greater: Britain After the Storm,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2022-04-19/greater-britain-after-storm,Greater: Britain After the Storm,"A former public relations professional, Mordaunt is now a rising cabinet minister in the United Kingdom’s Conservative government. She and her co-author call on British politicians to set forth a “clear well-executed national plan” that they promise will quell public polarization and dissatisfaction. Yet the plan they promote is internally contradictory and ducks tough tradeoffs. The government should do more, they say, but since it is hopelessly inefficient, tasks should be offloaded to private charities. Powerful business and financial firms are hollowing out the state, but economic growth requires low taxes and light regulation. Brexit is a triumph for traditional British democracy, and tighter alliances with English-speaking peoples (mostly the Americans) would solve many problems, yet relations with the United Kingdom’s largest trading partner, the EU, receive not a word. Such inconsistencies are papered over with enthusiastic praise of what Mordaunt believes to be the eternally courageous, generous, resourceful, and self-effacing virtues of the British people. Despite the book’s chipper optimism, a deeper cultural conflict simmers below the surface. When Mordaunt extols the success of former U.S. President Donald Trump’s electoral appeal to middle America, hints at crafting a version of his agenda for the United Kingdom, and speaks of “empowering the silent majority,” she offers a glimpse of an ominous possible future for the Conservative Party."

He argues against the “ruinous” Pentagon view that identifies an “operational level” of war between strategy and tactics. Separating the two leaves the objectives to the strategists and the detail of fighting to the tacticians, yet the real challenge is to bring the two together so that political purpose can infuse all military action. Friedman prefers the term “operational art,” which blends the logistical and wider strategic aspects of military planning. In separate chapters, he considers the six discrete disciplines that need to be marshaled when fighting wars—administration, information, coordination, fire support, logistics, and command and control—and uses a range of historical case studies, from the Battle of Austerlitz in 1805 to the Battle of Britain in 1940, to show how these disciplines are deployed. This is a book for the military professional yet one of interest to anyone curious as to why some operations succeed while others falter."

Through war, alliances are forged and broken, great powers expand and contract, and new norms emerge for state practice. Lissner shows, in this well-researched and lucidly argued account, how even the less cataclysmic conflicts that followed World War II led to adjustments in grand strategy. The originality of her approach lies in her interest in what great powers learn about themselves and reveal to others during these smaller wars, which are often militarily and diplomatically demanding even when they are not waged against other great powers. She shows how the U.S. wars in Korea, Vietnam, and the Persian Gulf led to major revisions of U.S. grand strategy. Indeed, each of these interventions challenged the assumptions of the previous war. Thanks to its intervention in Korea in the 1950s, the United States became much more of a global power and expanded its military capabilities and alliances. Thanks to the Vietnam War, the United States queried its rigid adherence to the containment of communism and Soviet influence. Thanks to the Persian Gulf War, the United States saw how it could take the lead in the post–Cold War world."

In this important contribution, Narang asks a different question. How do potential proliferators go about pursuing a nuclear option, and under what conditions do they succeed? He identifies four different strategies. The early nuclear weapons states were the big powers that had the resources to build the weapons on their own and so could “sprint” to the nuclear finishing line. The hedgers, by contrast, moved more cautiously in developing a nuclear option, not necessarily overtly pursuing it. Examples of this group include U.S. allies such as Japan and South Korea, which for now do not want to jeopardize their relations with Washington by getting the bomb. There are potentially many countries in this category, especially in the Middle East, owing to concern about Iran’s nuclear program. Others, such as Israel and North Korea, were able to get the bomb because allies sheltered them from the full risks of their pursuit of the weapon. The last group consists of countries that tried in secret to acquire or develop nuclear weapons in the hope that they wouldn’t get caught. But that path can be very tricky, as Iran, Libya, and Syria have discovered, and can lead to trouble."

Yet this is still a valuable and accessible guide to the insidious methods adopted regularly by the Russians and others to wage war by more covert means. The use of espionage, propaganda, bribery, counterfeiting, and extortion, often developed in collaboration with criminals, is hardly new. Galeotti provides historical precedents, including from Renaissance Italy, and reflects on how the Internet, social media, and the interconnectedness of modern societies have provided new opportunities to manipulate all aspects of everyday life. Unlike other writers on this topic, Galeotti is not in awe of these techniques: they often achieve far less than intended and can backfire on the perpetrators. With greater vigilance, Western democracies can not only fend off this subtle form of warfare but also turn it against their adversaries."

In this thoughtful history, Ucko offers a healthy corrective to this view, noting that insurgencies, such as those waged by the Tamil Tigers in Sri Lanka and the so-called Islamic State (or ISIS) in Iraq and Syria, often fail. With an impressive range of examples, he explores strategies used by insurgent groups from the colonial era to the digital age. Few insurgents have the power to confront a state directly, and those who rush into military action often falter. Ucko identifies three alternative approaches that offer better prospects for success. “Localized” insurgencies involve carving out a sphere of influence in a particular rural or urban area, as happened with the Jaish al-Mahdi militia in Baghdad’s Sadr City. “Infiltrative” insurgents, such as Sinn Fein in Northern Ireland, use legitimate political pathways to subvert the state while denying any connection to violence. And “ideational” insurgents create compelling narratives to generate momentum—for example, right-wing white supremacists in the United States. Ucko also discusses ways to combat and defeat these sorts of insurgencies."

Fortunately, this is an exceptionally provocative and original addition to an ample literature. Drawing on the historical record, Danielsson explains why regulators have not been more successful at limiting financial instability. They tend to focus excessively on exogenous risks (shocks coming from outside the financial system) while neglecting endogenous risks—the destabilizing responses of the participants in financial markets to those same exogenous shocks and, no less, to regulatory action. Having been encouraged in the wake of past crises to develop numerical measures of financial risks, regulators tend to place excessive confidence in the accuracy of those numbers, which are better at predicting the last crisis than the next one, given the ever-changing nature of the financial system. Regulators think of financial institutions and their activities as falling into various separate silos, and each regulator tends to care deeply about his or her particular silo, without considering the interconnectedness of the larger system. The author concludes that a more diverse financial system is likely to be more stable, for the same reasons that greater biodiversity in ecosystems, species, and individuals leads to greater systemic stability."

Although he acknowledges the urgent need to attend to climate change and income inequality, he makes the case that only the resources made available by an expanding market economy will suffice to address these problems. Containing climate change requires extensive investments on multiple fronts. But rather than being viewed as a cost to be borne, the needed projects should be seen as strategic investments with the capacity to boost growth in both the short and the long run. Firms and governments should move in this direction sooner rather than later (if only they can figure out how to work together), because the returns on green investments will be greatest for the first movers in developing and producing new clean technologies. Unavoidably, the turn away from fossil fuels will leave behind carbon-intensive sectors and their workers, amplifying concerns about inequality and creating resistance to the green transition. Governments will have to address simultaneously the two challenges of greening the economy and curbing excessive inequality for either to be successfully met."

Tabak’s engaging study of efforts in Wisconsin to attract the Taiwanese contract manufacturer Foxconn provides a cautionary tale. Such efforts inevitably involve an information asymmetry: manufacturing firms know more about their true employment and production plans than the governments seeking to attract them. Firms are able to play competing jurisdictions off against each other to obtain tax breaks and other commercial concessions. All too often, this combination of circumstances makes for bad public policy. Tabak’s book also contains two disturbing observations. First, officials can arrive at a distorted view of their constituents’ interests owing to their preoccupation with free-market ideology and their obsession with manufacturing jobs. Second, the power of eminent domain, which enables governments to convert private property to public use, can work against the public interest when employing it requires subsidizing private manufacturing firms."

The author celebrates the rising living standards and productivity growth made possible by the operation of markets and attributes support for the populist policies that hinder market dynamism, such as tariffs, to the inadequacy of compensation programs. He recommends strengthening existing compensation and adjustment mechanisms, such as the Earned Income Tax Credit, and creating new ones, including community-college block grants and “Personal Reemployment Accounts” to support retraining workers in the wake of long-term job losses. Hubbard may be overly optimistic, however, about the ability of politicians to agree on such measures. He fails to explain why, if the case for them is so strong, compensation and adjustment programs have been chronically underfunded in the United States."
38,Restarting the Future: How to Fix the Intangible Economy,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2022-04-19/restarting-future-how-fix-intangible-economy,Restarting the Future: How to Fix the Intangible Economy,"Most of the cost of an iPhone derives not from the materials and labor used in assembling it but from the ideas, or intellectual property, underlying its fabrication. The importance of such intangible inputs, as epitomized by smartphones, is an increasingly prevalent characteristic of the modern economy, but one accompanied by a disturbing slowdown in the growth of productivity. In this thought-provoking book, Haskel and Westlake attribute this slowdown—along with other economic problems, including rising inequality and the mushrooming of monopolies—to a mismatch between institutions and policies that were created for the era of tangible capital, on the one hand, and the needs of the intangible economy, on the other. The authors’ proposals for resolving this conflict are wide-ranging. They suggest changes in financial regulations to permit insurance companies and pension funds to invest in high-risk intangible assets, so as to finance and thereby encourage their development. They also recommend that governments alter patent protections to prevent firms with intellectual property from having to expend resources in fighting patent thieves."
39,Westphalia From Below: Humanitarian Intervention and the Myth of 1648,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2022-04-19/westphalia-below-humanitarian-intervention-and-myth-1648,Westphalia From Below: Humanitarian Intervention and the Myth of 1648,"In standard accounts, the Peace of Westphalia, concluded in 1648, was the founding moment of the modern system of nation-states, establishing sovereignty as an absolute right and the principle of nonintervention in the domestic affairs of other countries. That conventional view insists that the imperatives of humanitarian intervention and “the responsibility to protect” did not arise until hundreds of years later, in the last decades of the twentieth century, as a challenge to Westphalian norms. Peak questions this notion in this provocative book by examining the intellectual and humanistic culture of seventeenth-century Europe as it emerged from the chaos and violence of the Thirty Years’ War. The Westphalian settlement, in Peak’s view, wasn’t just an agreement among rulers to leave one another alone inside their own borders. It also captured a deeper aspiration felt by people coming out of the war: that such an order was intended to restore a sense of dignity and shared humanity in the wake of chaos. Peak shows how writers and artists in mid-seventeenth-century Europe broadly shared concerns about human dignity and desired order, justice, and social renewal. The reader, however, is left to search for explicit connections between the humanistic sensibilities of specific historical figures and the principles and architecture of the Westphalian settlement."

Instead, he sees the origins of today’s international relations in the tangled aftermath of World War I, when professors, politicians, journalists, activists, and philanthropists promoted research and education about war and the interdependence of countries. The book illuminates a remarkably large and sprawling transnational cast of characters, including women and internationalist thinkers outside the Anglo-American world, who were mostly not idealists but pragmatic problem solvers. Stöckmann argues that the founders of the field were “activist intellectuals” who believed that the worldwide spread of democracy would create new opportunities for citizens to debate and shape foreign policy and global institutions. Women, many of whom were teachers, journalists, and social workers, were part of this growing international community of thinkers. The Rockefeller Foundation and the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace played supporting roles. Peace studies programs emerged in Europe. The League of Nations provided venues for problem-oriented internationalism to flourish. And the field was born at the intersection of academia and diplomacy."
41,The Wrecking of the Liberal World Order,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/wrecking-liberal-world-order,The Wrecking of the Liberal World Order,"Parsi, one of Italy’s leading scholars of international relations, delivers a sweeping account of the rise and decline of the liberal world order. He argues that the Western-led postwar order was a great accomplishment, built around a compromise between political realism and the transformative aspirations of liberalism, balancing the interests of capital and labor through the institutions of the welfare state and the regulation of economic interdependence. But beginning in the 1980s, these complex balances and compromises all started to unravel. The Western liberal order was slowly replaced by a “neoliberal global order.” The decline of American leadership, reflected in the foreign policy of former U.S. President Donald Trump, compounded the problem, as has the rise of China and Russia as revisionist great powers seeking to roll back the frontiers of the liberal international order. For Parsi, however, the greatest danger lies in the fraying social fabric of Western liberal societies. The tableau of discontent is familiar: rampant economic inequality and technologically driven social dislocation have fueled a politics of nationalist and populist backlash. Parsi hopes that a new generation of liberal-minded thinkers will reimagine and rebuild the liberal order, beginning with a new social pact around fairer and more inclusive democratic systems."
42,Good International Citizenship: The Case for Decency,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2022-04-19/good-international-citizenship-case-decency,Good International Citizenship: The Case for Decency,"In this inspiring and deeply reasoned book, Evans makes the case for a foreign policy that binds the interests of one’s country to the well-being of the wider world. Building on ideas first advanced during his years as Australia’s foreign minister, from 1988 to 1996, Evans argues that a state’s “good international citizenship” can be pursued in four general ways: through the generosity of its foreign aid, through its responses to human rights violations, through its reactions to genocide and its aftermath, and through its contributions to addressing existential global dangers, such as global warming and nuclear war. He is most eloquent in making the case that states should see good international citizenship as both a moral imperative and a hardheaded calculation of the national interest. A state’s enlightened foreign policy would facilitate global problem solving, encourage reciprocity, and help generate soft power. Reflecting on Australia’s foreign policy record, Evans offers a mixed assessment. Australian leaders have laudably pursued “value issues”—offering relief in natural disasters and extending humanitarian assistance. But these isolated acts of charity are insufficient; ultimately, states must understand good citizenship in the international community as integral to their self-interest and national security."
43,Degenerations of Democracy,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2022-04-19/degenerations-democracy,Degenerations of Democracy,"Many scholars have traced the crisis of Western liberal democracy to the rise of authoritarian and populist leaders. Three distinguished theorists argue that the problems run deeper. They say that liberal societies are witnessing the long-term erosion, or “degeneration,” of their cultural and moral foundations. Wealth inequality and economic stagnation have exacerbated political divisions, but the bigger problem is the fraying of the civic solidarity that knits citizens together across lines of difference. The authors pay particular attention to the experience of disempowerment. Citizens no longer feel that they are participants in a political system thanks to the breakdown of social institutions such as trade unions, churches, youth sports leagues, and social service associations. The authors stress the importance of a shared identity to generate “social inclusion.” This works as a sort of invisible glue without which inherent dysfunctions and divisions in society become more apparent. The authors argue that the key to reversing the degeneration is to think of democracy as a centuries-old political project. It survived in earlier eras through political movements and coalitions that made societies more inclusive and responsive to human welfare, and it must do so again."
44,What War Is Still Good For,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/review-essay/2022-04-19/what-war-still-good,What War Is Still Good For,"It is not a good time to publish a book about war that begins, as Christopher Blattman’s Why We Fight does, by belaboring just how improbable armed conflict is—even between enemies, even when they engage in brinkmanship—because of the many incentives to avoid it. That isn’t to say Blattman is wrong to argue that war is relatively rare and that most conflicts that have the potential to turn violent are resolved peacefully. War is indeed “in the error term,” as the political scientist Erik Gartzke memorably put it: the factors social scientists have identified for explaining war don’t actually predict it very well, because something random and intangible divides rivals that have reason to use force from those that actually do so. And most don’t."
45,Deep Takes,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/review-essay/2022-04-19/deep-takes,Deep Takes,"Just how new can a new history of humanity hope to be? Scholars have long agreed on the overall contours of human social evolution. For most of their existence, humans were few in number, lived in small groups, and spent much of their time foraging and hunting. Once the climate stabilized after the end of the last Ice Age, around 12,000 years ago, novel ways of feeding and organizing humanity finally became possible, from farming and herding to cities and states. People, domesticated crops, and livestock multiplied and were drawn into an ever-tighter symbiosis. Before long, social hierarchies and structures of control proliferated. Kings, priests, and scribes learned how to lord it over the masses. Such early civilizations laid the foundations for the world today."
46,Out of Africa,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/review-essay/2022-04-19/out-africa,Out of Africa,"Africa remains poorly understood by the rest of the world and frequently distorted in global conversations, whether in the work of African and Africanist scholars, the reporting of journalists, or the missives of aid workers. They tend to see Africa as exceptional, defined by its difference. An asymmetry shapes the way people—Africans and non-Africans alike—describe the continent. For instance, Belgium (with its perennial tensions between French speakers and Flemish speakers), Canada (home to a sometimes rancorous Québécois separatism), and Russia (where many ethnic minorities are uneasily parceled into republics) are seen as multinational federations, but the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, and Nigeria are sites of so-called nation building, where motley tribes need to be forged into nations. What counts as federalism elsewhere becomes tribalism in Africa."
47,Rebels Without a Cause,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/africa/2022-04-19/rebels-without-cause,Rebels Without a Cause,"On August 1, 2018, the government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo declared an outbreak of Ebola in the country’s war-torn northeast. It was Congo’s tenth recorded outbreak of the deadly hemorrhagic fever, but the first in an active conflict zone. Determined to avoid a repeat of the West African Ebola epidemic in 2014, when outside help was too little, too late, donors threw caution to the wind and pumped more than $700 million into northeastern Congo to fight the disease over the next 20 months. To protect their staff members, the World Health Organization and its partners put both Congolese security forces and local militia members on their payrolls. This created perverse incentives: although the combatants had reason to refrain from attacking aid workers, they also had an interest in prolonging the epidemic so they could keep profiting from it. Between August 2018 and June 2020, when the Ebola epidemic was finally declared over, some militiamen and members of the government security forces stoked violence and instability so that the disease would continue to spread and the international aid agencies would continue to pay them. A well-meaning effort to contain the disease ended up doing the exact opposite."

This was followed by the revelation a few weeks later that another 110 missile silos were under construction in Hami, in Xinjiang Province. Together with other planned expansions, these sites amount to a dramatic shift in the country’s approach to nuclear weapons. For decades, China maintained a relatively small nuclear force, but according to current U.S. intelligence estimates, that arsenal is now on track to nearly quadruple, to 1,000 weapons, by 2030, a number that will put China far above any other nuclear power save Russia and the United States. Nor does it seem likely that Beijing will stop there, given President Xi Jinping’s commitment to build a “world class” military by 2049 and his refusal to enter into arms control talks."

Over the course of 20 minutes, the new president detailed many of Washington’s overseas interests, including promoting democracy and working with U.S. allies to compete against China. He identified a bevy of international challenges, including cyberattacks, nuclear proliferation, and refugee flows. But when it came time to talk about international economics, Biden pivoted away from looking abroad and instead focused his attention at home. “There’s no longer a bright line between foreign and domestic policy,” he said. “Every action we take in our conduct abroad, we must take with American working families in mind.” Washington, he said, must advance “a foreign policy for the middle class.”"

Its economy and military emerged from the war not just unscathed but also supreme. Its institutions of governance—a unified Department of Defense, a system of far-flung military commands, the National Security Council, specialized agencies for international development, and so on—were those of an effective global hegemon. Even when it was locked in a mortal struggle with the alien and hostile ideology of communism, it held most of the winning cards. And as colossi do, it elicited resentment from those not content to live in its shadow."

Although there was no shortage of conflict and mayhem, the violence rarely led to dramatic change. No states were conquered and eliminated outright. Dictators came and went, but borders and even regimes changed little. After 1973, most of the major countries in the region stopped fighting one another directly, opting for terrorism and insurgency—strategies of the weak—over conventional attacks. Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and the Libyan leader Muammar al-Qaddafi took longer to learn. Indeed, Saddam never really learned at all. But they were the exceptions that proved the rule."
53,Single-Market Power,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/europe/2022-04-19/single-market-power,Single-Market Power,"Which has a more complete single market, the United States or the European Union? Conventional wisdom suggests an obvious answer: the United States. Since 1789, the American federation has pursued its founding mission to guarantee the free flow of interstate commerce. Although many of today’s American progressives want to copy heavy-handed European models of regulation and social welfare, they confront well-organized free marketeers and business interests determined to defend the United States’ system of open capitalism."
54,Putin Unbound,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/ukraine/2022-04-06/putin-russia-ukraine-war-unbound,Putin Unbound,"Before he started massing troops, few expected Vladimir Putin to invade Ukraine, and even once he did, few expected him to behave the way he has. In a shocking act of aggression, the Russian leader sent troops to bomb cities such as Kharkiv and Mariupol and to attack schools, hospitals, and apartment buildings throughout the country, killing hundreds—if not thousands—of civilians. His extreme demands—calling for Ukraine to disarm, formally recognize the loss of Crimea, give up large swaths of territory in the eastern part of the country, and renounce any intention to join NATO—have stunned the world, as has his repeated nuclear saber rattling. Instead of winning over the Ukrainians, Putin has quickly turned the population irrevocably against him. And he has grossly overestimated the strength and speed of his military, which stumbled badly in the early weeks of the war. How could a leader regularly hailed as a skilled tactician, if not a strategic genius, make so many rash and seemingly counterproductive moves?"
55,The Price of Hegemony,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/ukraine/2022-04-06/russia-ukraine-war-price-hegemony,The Price of Hegemony,"For years, analysts have debated whether the United States incited Russian President Vladimir Putin’s interventions in Ukraine and other neighboring countries or whether Moscow’s actions were simply unprovoked aggressions. That conversation has been temporarily muted by the horrors of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. A wave of popular outrage has drowned out those who have long argued that the United States has no vital interests at stake in Ukraine, that it is in Russia’s sphere of interest, and that U.S. policies created the feelings of insecurity that have driven Putin to extreme measures. Just as the attack on Pearl Harbor silenced the anti-interventionists and shut down the debate over whether the United States should have entered World War II, Putin’s invasion has suspended the 2022 version of Americans’ endless argument over their purpose in the world."
56,The Outsiders,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/ukraine/2022-04-06/china-russia-ukraine-international-system-outsiders,The Outsiders,"In late February, as Russian forces moved into Ukraine, Vladimir Putin declared that his offensive was aimed not just at bringing Russia’s neighbor to heel but also at repudiating the U.S.-led liberal international order. “Where the West comes to establish its own order,” the Russian president railed, “the result is bloody, unhealed wounds, ulcers of international terrorism and extremism.” Moscow would now seek to roll back the expanding order as “a matter of life and death, a matter of our historical future as a people.” Russia’s full-scale war on Ukraine is only the most recent act in a years-long effort to overturn the existing status quo, one that has featured cyberattacks, assassinations, a war against Georgia, meddling in U.S. elections, military involvement in Syria, and the annexation of Crimea."
57,The Return of Conquest?,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/ukraine/2022-04-06/ukraine-russia-war-return-conquest,The Return of Conquest?,"Russian President Vladimir Putin has long declared that Ukraine has never existed as an independent country. The former Soviet republic is “not even a state,” he said as early as 2008. In a speech on February 21 of this year, he elaborated, arguing that “modern Ukraine was entirely and fully created by Russia.” Days later, he ordered Russian forces to invade Ukraine. As Russian tanks streamed across the Ukrainian border, Putin seemed to be acting on a sinister, long-held goal: to erase Ukraine from the map of the world."
58,The Cold War Never Ended,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/review-essay/2022-04-06/cold-war-never-ended-russia-ukraine-war,The Cold War Never Ended,"Does anyone have a right to be surprised? A gangster regime in the Kremlin has declared that its security is threatened by a much smaller neighbor—which, the regime claims, is not a truly sovereign country but just a plaything of far more powerful Western states. To make itself more secure, the Kremlin insists, it needs to bite off some of its neighbor’s territory. Negotiations between the two sides break down; Moscow invades."
59,Putin’s War on History,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/ukraine/2022-04-06/putins-war-history-ukraine-russia,Putin’s War on History,"On the evening of February 21, 2022, three days before Russian forces began the largest land invasion on the European continent since World War II, Russian President Vladimir Putin gave an angry televised speech. In it, he expressed familiar grievances about the eastward expansion of NATO, alleged Ukrainian aggression, and the presence of Western missiles on Russia’s border. But most of his tirade was devoted to something else: Ukrainian history. “Ukraine is not just a neighboring country for us,” Putin said. “It is an inalienable part of our own history, culture, and spiritual space.” Ukraine’s borders, he asserted, have no meaning other than to mark a former administrative division of the Soviet Union: “Modern Ukraine was entirely created by Russia.”"
60,A Country of Their Own,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/ukraine/2022-04-01/francis-fukuyama-liberalism-country,A Country of Their Own,"Liberalism is in peril. The fundamentals of liberal societies are tolerance of difference, respect for individual rights, and the rule of law, and all are under threat as the world suffers what can be called a democratic recession or even a depression. According to Freedom House, political rights and civil liberties around the world have fallen each year for the last 16 years. Liberalism’s decline is evident in the growing strength of autocracies such as China and Russia, the erosion of liberal—or nominally liberal—institutions in countries such as Hungary and Turkey, and the backsliding of liberal democracies such as India and the United States."

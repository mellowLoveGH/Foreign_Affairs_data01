0,Conquering Peace: From the Enlightenment to the European Union,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-08-24/conquering-peace-enlightenment-european-union,Conquering Peace: From the Enlightenment to the European Union,"Ghervas traces European efforts to create peace settlements, starting with the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713 and moving through the Congress of Vienna in the nineteenth century, the League of Nations and the negotiations to temper the Cold War in the twentieth century, and discussions within today’s enlarged European Union. Any historical narrative of this scale can seek to answer only big questions—in this case: What brought about peace and allowed settlements to endure? Hundreds of books, many of them classics, have addressed that puzzle. Some stress the rise and fall of totalitarian alternatives to liberal democracy; others, the changing nature of economic interdependence, the diffusion of political and social welfare rights, the spread of national self-determination, the rising destructiveness of military technology, the role of hegemonic powers, or the design of international legal institutions. In such august and crowded company, this book’s interpretation remains frustratingly opaque. At times, the author seems to be a Hegelian, explaining each settlement as the result of a corresponding (if often ill-defined) “spirit” of the age. Yet sometimes, she takes a view more grounded in pragmatism, arguing that narrow functional interests and responses to immediate events dictated policy. And elsewhere, she rejects the search for historical lessons entirely."
1,"The Comparative Politics of Immigration: Policy Choices in Germany, Canada, Switzerland, and the United States",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/comparative-politics-immigration-policy-choices-germany-canada-switzerland-and-united,"The Comparative Politics of Immigration: Policy Choices in Germany, Canada, Switzerland, and the United States","Immigration is the most volatile foreign policy issue in the world today. Since the end of World War II, developed countries have allowed over 100 million foreign nationals to resettle within their borders. Governments had to carefully manage the tensions between economic incentives and special interest groups that favored increased immigration, on the one hand, and restrictionist public opinion, on the other. This book points out that the concrete policies countries pursued often differed considerably, depending on which political body—the executive branch, the legislature, or a local authority—made the key decisions. Bodies more vulnerable to public opinion adopted restrictive policies, whereas those less so chose more open policies. As an analysis of how developed countries have gotten where they are today, this argument seems persuasive. But it might miss the contemporary forest for the historical trees. Today, as the author concedes in the conclusion, advocates of immigration find themselves beleaguered everywhere. Public opposition to immigration has grown so virulent that even highly insulated political institutions cannot protect politicians from the backlash against it. As a result, nearly every developed country has adopted more restrictive policies toward immigrants (including those seeking to unify their families), asylum seekers, and refugees."
2,The Greek Revolution: 1821 and the Making of Modern Europe,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-08-24/greek-revolution-1821-and-making-modern-europe,The Greek Revolution: 1821 and the Making of Modern Europe,"This year marks the bicentennial of the beginning of the Greek Revolution of 1821, through which Greece gained its independence from the Ottoman Empire. This lively introduction persuasively argues that the rebellion was not just a local squabble but an epochal shift in modern history. The American Revolution aside, it was the first of many conflicts in which a small nation asserted its right to self-determination and self-government against an ancient empire. The dynamics of such conflicts have since become familiar. Although some Greeks sought to vindicate a vision of nationhood, most fought to defend their right to practice Christianity, avenge oppression, depose foreign landlords, or simply make money. Diaspora communities and small powers got involved, and powerful local groups grabbed land, resources, and power. Both sides committed atrocities and massacres. Many Greeks fought heroically, but in the end, they prevailed only because France, Russia, and the United Kingdom intervened to crush the imperial Egyptian and Ottoman forces. Over the next 200 years, in much the same way, many nation-states would replace principalities, kingdoms, empires, and colonies that had existed for centuries."
3,Embattled Europe: A Progressive Alternative,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-08-24/embattled-europe-progressive-alternative,Embattled Europe: A Progressive Alternative,"This provocative book argues that Europe is the global beacon of progressive politics today. Among global powers, Europe alone espouses a model of the future that is politically legitimate, socially just, and technologically sustainable, Jarausch claims. Only European countries have established fair political systems that limit campaign spending, guarantee the proportional electoral representation of diverse views, and maintain effective government bureaucracies. Only European countries guarantee minimal subsistence and medical care to all. Other countries cater to the wealthiest one percent of their people; European countries remain the best places for those of modest means. Only European governments divert resources from military spending to more cost-effective nonmilitary tools, such as aid, trade, and multilateral institutions. And European countries consistently uphold the world’s strongest regulatory protections in areas such as the environment, digital privacy, finance, business competition, and consumer safety. The author, a celebrated historian of Europe, acknowledges that the Old Continent faces challenges, but this book remains a useful corrective to the pervasive and misleading Europe-bashing that often occupies the global press."
4,Future War and the Defense of Europe,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-08-24/future-war-and-defense-europe,Future War and the Defense of Europe,"The authors begin with a 20-page hypothetical scenario in which Russia attacks and defeats Europe, despite U.S. military support. The rest of the book recommends a policy to head off such a calamity: the Western allies, led by the Europeans, need to “sharpen NATO’s spear tip” by spending more—much more, clearly, although exactly how much remains a mystery—on high-tech military development and the procurement of weapons compatible with U.S. systems. As the authors note in the preface, some may view such scenarios as scaremongering by defense planners and military contractors—an assessment with which I have considerable sympathy. Others may wonder why the authors do not stop to ask how this plan would be funded—and whether the backlash against such an immense outlay would actually undermine Western security. Yet everyone concerned about transatlantic relations should read this book, because the authors are neither obscure extremists nor writers of alternative history. Instead, they are pillars of the transatlantic foreign policy establishment: two distinguished retired U.S. generals, one who now heads the centrist Brookings Institution, and a British academic prominent in NATO circles. This is how many, perhaps most, Western military planners think—particularly those in the United States."
5,The Chancellor: The Remarkable Odyssey of Angela Merkel,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-08-24/chancellor-remarkable-odyssey-angela-merkel,The Chancellor: The Remarkable Odyssey of Angela Merkel,"In a few months, Angela Merkel will step down after a decade and a half as the chancellor of Germany. Polls show she remains the world’s most respected political leader, perhaps because she cuts against the stereotype of modern politicians as egotists pandering to public opinion. She is unglamorous and reserved, instinctively moderate, slow to make decisions, and prone to communicate in cerebral, fact-based monologues. This is the best English-language biography of her rise from a tough and traditional family, through her career as a physical chemist in communist East Germany, to her current renown—but it is far from definitive. As with most traditional journalistic accounts, Marton’s book focuses a great deal on what Merkel said and did at various critical meetings, attributing her success to her intelligence and tenacity and her failures to her idealistic moral courage. The reader learns far less about the electoral, partisan, diplomatic, and technical constraints under which Merkel acted. The picture is further limited by the author’s curious decision to focus almost exclusively on German relations with the United States and Russia, thereby excluding economic diplomacy, climate change, China, the European Union, and the developing world—not to mention German domestic politics, about which the book says hardly anything."
6,Last Best Hope: America in Crisis and Renewal,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-08-24/last-best-hope-america-crisis-and-renewal,Last Best Hope: America in Crisis and Renewal,"A more searing, accurate dissection of Donald Trump and his associates will likely never be written. Trump, Packer writes, is “an all-American flimflam man and demagogue, . . . spawned in a gold-plated sewer.” He was able to articulate so effectively the resentment that is the essence of his supporters’ condition because its taste “was in his mouth, too.” Of Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law and a senior official in Trump’s White House “with expertise in nothing,” Packer notes that “he interfered in the work of more competent officials, compromised security protocols, dabbled in conflicts of interest, flirted with violations of federal law and then promised nationwide [COVID-19] testing through his business connections, which never materialized.” Packer’s main interest, however, is not Trump and his circle but the country that elected him, since “a failure the size of Trump took the whole of America.” The book focuses on the events of 2020 because “nothing Trump did was more destructive than turning the pandemic into a central front in the partisan war,” thereby causing hundreds of thousands of needless deaths. Packer traces recent U.S. history through a piercingly insightful exploration of what he discerns as four overlapping national narratives. They are not those captured by statistics but those that describe Americans’ “deepest needs and desires . . . [and] convey a moral identity.” He calls them “Free America” (libertarian), “Smart America” (meritocratic), “Real America” (the populists’ mythical provincial village), and “Just America” (more accurately, Unjust America). All have emerged from a half century of rising inequality, which has produced a country that, in Packer’s view, is no longer governable."
7,Ethel Rosenberg: An American Tragedy,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-08-24/ethel-rosenberg-american-tragedy,Ethel Rosenberg: An American Tragedy,"Ethel Rosenberg was the only American woman ever executed for a crime other than murder and, with her husband, Julius, was one of only two Americans ever to face capital punishment for conspiring to commit espionage in peacetime. In her tragic story, told here by an accomplished biographer, she often appears as a human Rorschach test onto which others projected their own passions, largely ignoring her individual identity and massively confusing the question of her guilt or innocence. Her life and death by electrocution, in 1953, were shaped to no small degree by misogyny, anti-Semitism, and, above all, a nationwide, exaggerated fear of the Soviet Union. Her mother ignored her both as a child and as an adult and had eyes only for Ethel’s brother David Greenglass, who, ironically, himself spied for the Soviets but was not executed. Not until many years later was it finally revealed that Greenglass had perjured himself, lying in grand jury testimony about Ethel’s involvement in espionage. The government’s case against her was recognized to be extremely weak, but neither President Harry Truman nor President Dwight Eisenhower dared to appear soft on communism by admitting as much and dropping the case. Ultimately, it seems that although she was a Communist, Ethel was not a spy."
8,Rethinking American Grand Strategy,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-08-24/rethinking-american-grand-strategy,Rethinking American Grand Strategy,"“Grand strategy” is a term that is as difficult to define as it is widely used by scholars and practitioners. This volume’s editors and contributors believe that the concept needs to be reconceived by extending it in two dimensions. It should be broadened beyond its roots in military affairs and conventionally defined security to include a variety of additional issues, such as immigration, public health, demographics, international assistance, and climate change. It also needs to reach beyond its traditional focus on the state as the only important player to include other influential voices and actors, including, among others, nonprofit interest groups, organized religion, and the business sector. This volume doesn’t address all those areas, but it is a valuable contribution to the task of broadly rethinking the goals and tactics of U.S. foreign policy. The analyses it presents are solidly rooted in history and provide thought-provoking insights into issues and actors that grand strategists rarely consider."
9,"The Words That Made Us: America’s Constitutional Conversation, 1760–1840",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-08-24/words-made-us-americas-constitutional-conversation-1760-1840,"The Words That Made Us: America’s Constitutional Conversation, 1760–1840","With the rare ability to combine history and law, Amar takes a fresh, heterodox look at how “America became America.” Amar, a distinguished professor of law and political science, sees the Declaration of Independence, the U.S. Constitution, and the Bill of Rights as having simply “followed from the logic” of a sophisticated “constitutional conversation” carried out over three decades in letters, newspapers, pamphlets, and courtrooms by the mass of Americans (or at least white, male, and literate ones). That rolling dialogue, he argues, deserves more credit for the Declaration of Independence than does Thomas Jefferson (merely “a good scribe”) and made a bigger contribution to the Constitution than did James Madison. Scholars have erred in attaching importance to Madison’s essay “Federalist No. 10” (in The Federalist Papers), Amar claims; at the time of its publication, “almost no one paid any attention” to it. The only founder who really mattered, in Amar’s view, was the relatively silent George Washington: the Constitution was “designed by and for” him alone to such a degree that his two elections as president amounted to re-ratifications of it. Amar seamlessly combines his two disciplines, crafting a swiftly paced, highly iconoclastic narrative and making important legal arcana accessible to all readers."
10,"American Republics: A Continental History of the United States, 1783–1850",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-08-24/american-republics-continental-history-united-states-1783-1850,"American Republics: A Continental History of the United States, 1783–1850","This volume follows two earlier works, American Colonies and American Revolutions, to form a trilogy by one of the preeminent historians of the period. The plural terms in the second and third titles underline the books’ central theme: that the early history of what became the United States was not what most Americans have been taught. The real story, Taylor writes in this deeply researched and beautifully written book, is not of a singular revolution that followed a sure path toward nationhood and then swept across the continent with confidence and moral purpose but rather a tale of fragility and intense dispute. The key actors were disparate states, deeply suspicious of one another, to which Americans owed their primary allegiance. Their coming together was so contentious and uncertain that most Americans at the time had reason to think of what they were doing as framing only a union, not a nation. Taylor grippingly describes the yawning gap that opened up between the founding documents’ soaring principles and the reality of white Americans’ behavior. The massive wrongs the majority perpetrated in their oppression of Native Americans and Black slaves were nearly equaled by the terrible treatment they inflicted on free Black people."
11,The Changing of the Guard: The British Army Since 9/11,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-08-24/changing-guard-british-army-911,The Changing of the Guard: The British Army Since 9/11,"The British army’s experience of the Iraq war began with dissatisfaction with a role that it did not feel was commensurate with its contribution and ended with humiliation. The army got bogged down fighting a Shiite militia in Basra with which they eventually had to cut a deal. British forces were spared further embarrassment only when they were able to help defeat the militia by participating in a 2008 battle referred to as Operation Charge of the Knights, which was initiated by the Iraqi government and backed by the Americans. Well before that, British senior commanders had tried to retrieve the army’s reputation by taking a major role in Afghanistan, but that did not go much better. Drawing on some 260 interviews (including one with me), Akam, a journalist who himself spent a year serving in the British army, recounts the story of these difficult years with candor, great detail, and occasional indignation, bemoaning the harm done to the institution by class tensions, alcohol, and unaccountable officers who made poor tactical choices in pursuit of often incoherent strategies. Akam makes no claim to be balanced, and this is a dense and at times undisciplined book. But much of what he writes rings true, and all told, it makes for a valuable and salutary read."
12,Stalin’s War: A New History of World War II,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-08-24/stalins-war-new-history-world-war-ii,Stalin’s War: A New History of World War II,"Instead of writing yet another history of World War II centered on Adolf Hitler, McMeekin takes a more original approach, focusing on Joseph Stalin. McMeekin pulls no punches in reminding readers that throughout the war, Stalin played a cruel, manipulative, and uncompromising game. His cynical deal with Hitler in August 1939 allowed the Soviet Union to take Poland and the Baltic states and pushed European democracies into a draining war with Germany. When it was the Soviet Union that was struggling to push the Germans back, Stalin demanded that the United Kingdom and the United States contort their own war plans to provide him with material assistance and establish a second front. McMeekin argues, less persuasively, that Stalin was acting as an orthodox Leninist with a long-term goal from the start. McMeekin also develops an unconvincing and at times preposterous counterfactual war. He argues, for example, that to thwart Stalin’s plans, the United Kingdom could have sided with Finland in the “Winter War” of 1939–40 and made its own peace with Germany after the fall of France. McMeekin’s research is prodigious, and his writing is vigorous, but in the end, he pushes his argument past the breaking point."
13,Beyond the Sand and Sea: One Family’s Quest for a Country to Call Home,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-08-24/beyond-sand-and-sea-one-familys-quest-country-call-home,Beyond the Sand and Sea: One Family’s Quest for a Country to Call Home,"In the massive Dadaab refugee camp in Kenya, the weather is hot, the landscape is barren, and relief agencies and the authorities alike generally treat the hundreds of thousands of Somali inhabitants, many of whom have lived there for decades, with suspicion, hostility, and abuse. In this environment, McCormick, an editor at this magazine, meets Asad, a young man who is a gifted writer. The book tells the tale of Asad’s struggle to leave the camp for the United States and the story of his sister Maryan, who found her way there a decade earlier. The shift in perspective between the two siblings is a great strength of the book. Asad is what many Americans might think of as the ideal immigrant: he earns the American dream through hard work, intelligence, and stamina, ultimately winning a scholarship and admittance to Princeton University. Maryan’s experience is more typical—and in many ways more revealing about the risks and tradeoffs that even fortunate refugees face. She, too, worked hard and shone at school, but once in the promised land, she struggled with a controlling husband, low-paying jobs, and loneliness. McCormick’s book offers rare insight into the extreme difficulties with which some people live and the amazing ability that some of them show to dream and persist, even when the odds are slim and success presents challenges of its own."
14,Regional Integration in West Africa: Is There a Role for a Single Currency?,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-08-24/regional-integration-west-africa-there-role-single-currency,Regional Integration in West Africa: Is There a Role for a Single Currency?,"The Economic Community of West African States is perhaps the strongest subregional organization in Africa. In 2019, the member governments agreed to form a currency union, which they intend to launch by 2027. Prasad and Songwe’s short book assesses the plan’s prospects. They concede that the potential economic benefits of a currency union are significant in terms of greater trade and investment and that it could enhance the macroeconomic discipline of member governments and protect them from external shocks. Still, their informative account focuses mostly on the likely pitfalls. They argue that a successful launch of such a union would require much greater economic and policy integration among the countries and much stronger institutional mechanisms for fiscal coordination and risk management. In the absence of such arrangements, they recommend taking more modest steps to further the financial and economic integration of the region, such as harmonizing economic and financial policies and encouraging the development of a regional financial market."
15,Two Books on U.S. Foreign Policy in Africa,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-08-24/two-books-us-foreign-policy-africa,Two Books on U.S. Foreign Policy in Africa,"These two fascinating histories of U.S. involvement in Africa illuminate the role of American civil society activists in U.S. foreign policy—and also the extent to which they have viewed their work in sub-Saharan Africa as an extension of their progressive commitments at home. Talton portrays Mickey Leland, who was a Democratic congressman from Texas, as emblematic of a generation of African American leaders who came of age during the civil rights struggle and understood international issues through the prism of Third World radicalism. In the 1970s and 1980s, they exerted a significant influence on U.S. policies on Africa, the book argues, notably on Leland’s two signature issues: apartheid in South Africa and the brutal Ethiopian famine of the early 1980s. On Leland’s sixth trip to Ethiopia, in 1989, he died when a small plane on which he was flying to visit a refugee camp on the border with Sudan crashed. Talton’s narrative operates both as a biography of the charismatic Leland and his political evolution from a radical activist in Houston to a well-established Washington insider and as an insightful history of the role that groups such as the Congressional Black Caucus played in U.S. policy toward Africa during the later years of the Cold War."
16,Gendered Institutions and Women’s Political Representation in Africa,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-08-24/gendered-institutions-and-womens-political-representation-africa,Gendered Institutions and Women’s Political Representation in Africa,"Over the course of the last three decades, many African countries have instituted quotas to increase the representation of women in their legislatures and in leadership positions in political parties. By most quantitative measures, such quotas have succeeded. But have they substantially altered public policies in a manner that benefits the welfare and rights of women? This collection of generally excellent essays offers convincing evidence from half a dozen African countries that the answer is mostly no. The case studies collected here suggest that the reform of formal institutions to increase women’s representation has often been undermined by various informal institutions that continue to enforce patriarchal norms in day-to-day politics. For instance, regardless of official party commitments to gender equality, the patron-client relationships that undergird much of African politics are still dominated by men, especially at the local level. Other factors have also limited progress. In South Africa and Tanzania, for example, female parliamentarians are constrained by conservative attitudes that still hold sway among party elites and that discourage them from proposing more progressive social policies."
17,Bring Back Our Girls: The Untold Story of the Global Search for Nigeria’s Missing Schoolgirls,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-08-24/bring-back-our-girls-untold-story-global-search-nigerias-missing,Bring Back Our Girls: The Untold Story of the Global Search for Nigeria’s Missing Schoolgirls,"Parkinson and Hinshaw have written a powerful account of the jihadi terrorist group Boko Haram’s 2014 abduction of 276 students from the Government Girls Secondary School in the northeastern Nigerian town of Chibok, which generated an international social media campaign for their release under the hashtag #BringBackOurGirls. The authors spoke to around 20 of the girls who were abducted and later freed and gained access to the journal that one of them had managed to keep during her three years in captivity. The result is a fine-grained picture of their harrowing ordeal, during which they hid in a forest with their captors in precarious circumstances, while the Nigerian army led a desultory and ineffectual search for them. The book also relates the complex and multilayered negotiations for their release, which it suggests were complicated by the international notoriety the girls had gained, as it increased their value as hostages in the eyes of Boko Haram leaders. The narrative ends in 2017, when the negotiations resulted in the release of 82 of the girls. At least 100 of them are still missing today."
18,Three Books on Tibet,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-08-24/three-books-tibet,Three Books on Tibet,"Beijing’s difficulty incorporating Tibetans into the Chinese nation goes back to the earliest days of communist rule. These three books offer precious insights into a hidden history, hinting at the range of stories that will be told if the region’s archives are ever opened. During a brief period of access, Weiner was able to conduct research in the government and party archives of the Zeku Tibetan Autonomous County, in Qinghai Province, poring over documents dating from 1953 to 1960. Once the new communist government had pacified resistance, it merged two organizational systems: Tibetan tribal chieftains and religious leaders manned the government, and Han cadres from outside the region staffed the more powerful Chinese Community Party organization. Beijing was unsatisfied with the results of that system. The party sought to persuade the local communities to identify with a larger, multiethnic Chinese nation but faced various forms of passive and active resistance. In 1958, the party moved decisively to destroy the local power structure and create pastoral collectives. The Tibetans and the Hui Muslims in the region rebelled but were repressed with great violence, which was followed by a severe famine. Parallel events occurred across the Tibetan Plateau, creating a legacy that shapes Han-Tibetan relations today."

In 2014, the military, fearing that the king’s son, Vajiralongkorn, would not be a popular successor, had carried out a coup—the country’s 12th since its transition to a constitutional monarchy in 1932—and intensified its use of the lese majesty law to repress critics of the monarchy. The new king turned out to be even more selfish, impulsive, and violent than feared. In this informative volume, 14 leading specialists on Thailand probe the stalemate between the conservative power structure of the monarchy, the military, and Buddhist leaders, on the one hand, and opposition forces among urban youth, the lower-middle class, and rural residents of the north and the northeast, on the other. The palace and the military cling to each other ever more tightly and rule ever less competently, a political alliance in obvious decline but incapable of either retreat or reform."
20,Immigrant Incorporation in East Asian Democracies,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-08-24/immigrant-incorporation-east-asian-democracies,Immigrant Incorporation in East Asian Democracies,"Shrinking birthrates and growing life expectancy have created a crisis of aging in East Asian societies, but a commitment to ethnocultural purity prevents the obvious fix: immigration. Most immigrants, if they can stay in the countries at all, must retain their foreign citizenship, sometimes for generations; only foreign brides are normally allowed to naturalize. In recent decades, however, immigrants have achieved some new rights in the three East Asian democracies studied in this book—Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. In each case, civil society actors drove the process in different ways. Progress has been slowest in Taiwan, where the pro-immigrant movement was overshadowed by stronger movements concerned with protecting jobs, increasing respect for aboriginal communities, and asserting Taiwan’s separate identity from China. In Japan, local governments and volunteer groups provided services for foreigners similar to those available to citizens. The strongest support for immigrants emerged in South Korea, where the progressive labor, religious, and human rights movements that grew out of the struggle for democracy in the 1980s fought for a full range of labor protections for guest workers. But in all three places, even naturalized immigrants continue to face discrimination. Chung’s informative study offers a fresh view on political movements and racial attitudes in Asian democracies."
21,Two Books on Chinese Strategy,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-08-24/two-books-chinese-strategy,Two Books on Chinese Strategy,"The best U.S. policy toward China would be based on an accurate assessment of Beijing’s strategic ambitions. These valuable books present the debate about that policy in clear terms and pose critical questions for Washington. It is indisputable that China views the United States as the main threat to its security, but that does not answer the question of how far Beijing intends to extend its own power. Does China merely seek more influence in existing international institutions? Does it want to dominate its region? Does it seek to displace the United States entirely as the dominant global power? Doshi, who assumed the position of China director on the U.S. National Security Council after writing this book, makes a strong argument for the worst-case scenario, in which China’s long-term aims are to break up the U.S. alliance system, establish a global network of military bases, monopolize cutting-edge technologies, dominate trade with most countries, and foster authoritarian elites around the world. As evidence, he quotes extensively from the often obscure writings and speeches of Chinese leaders and thinkers, then infers their concrete meaning from China’s increasingly assertive recent actions. He rejects as unrealistic both proposals for accommodation and strategies to subvert the regime. Instead, he suggests policies the United States could adopt to at once “blunt” China’s influence through more active multilateral diplomacy and “re-build” the U.S.-centered international order by strengthening its alliances and encouraging domestic revival."
22,Informal Politics in the Middle East,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-08-24/informal-politics-middle-east,Informal Politics in the Middle East,"This collection of only loosely connected essays covers subjects as varied as the diwans of Kuwait (the reception rooms in which gossip is exchanged and power is brokered), tribal politics in Yemen, social activism in Egypt, voluntary agricultural associations in an Algerian oasis, political campaigning in Turkey, sectarianism in Qatar, women’s advocacy in Iran, and the politics of urban slums (ashwaiyyat) in Cairo. The contributors do not agree on what constitutes informality, only that the venues in which people in the region gather to express informed opinions, promote public improvements, and devise collective solutions are enormously varied. The Middle East and North Africa constitute a region that is typically thought to be stripped of everyday politics by brutal governments and crippling violence. Taken together, however, the contributions to this volume convey an impressive resolve on the part of ordinary people to work inside, outside, against, or beside official channels to address common problems. This is less “informal” politics than a quotidian, community-based willingness—and sometimes insistence—to work together to enhance public life."
23,After Repression: How Polarization Derails Democratic Transition,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-08-24/after-repression-how-polarization-derails-democratic-transition,After Repression: How Polarization Derails Democratic Transition,"Hiding behind this monograph’s generic title and sometimes masked by its scholarly rhetoric is a fascinating and provocative argument about why the Egyptian and Tunisian transitions took such different paths after the uprisings of 2010–11. Nugent argues persuasively that the different patterns of repression of the regimes in Egypt and Tunisia shaped the capacity and inclination of the various parts of the opposition movements to work together. The Egyptian dictator Hosni Mubarak’s selectively brutal targeting of the Muslim Brotherhood, his government’s relative leniency toward left-wing and other secularist political parties and movements, and the political segregation of the courts and the prison system divided the opposition and made it difficult for ideological adversaries to cooperate after Mubarak’s fall. By contrast, the Tunisian dictator Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali’s indiscriminate repression of opposition across the ideological spectrum provided opportunities, long before the uprising, for diverse political movements to collaborate, which produced the unusual levels of trust and teamwork exhibited by the political leadership that took over after Ben Ali’s departure. Particularly poignant are the accounts of former political prisoners in Tunisia who recall with respect and affection having shared cells—and long conversations—with ideological rivals. Across the Middle East, prison is one of the most important universities; Nugent shows how critical the quality of those schools is for the political elites who are their graduates."
24,Turkey: A Past Against History,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-08-24/turkey-past-against-history,Turkey: A Past Against History,"Refik Halid Karay was a journalist who figured among the dissidents in virtually every era of the tumultuous history of Ottoman and republican Turkey between the turn of the twentieth century and his death in 1965. In this biography, Philliou offers a subtle and revealing history of the meaning of opposition. Karay, born to a family of midlevel Ottoman bureaucrats, seems to have been both constitutionally contrarian and faithful to his upbringing and class: the ideal candidate for what nineteenth-century Europeans had come to know as “the loyal opposition.” But for much of the first half of the twentieth century, there was no room for such a figure in Ottoman or Turkish politics. In both the despotic empire and the authoritarian republic, opposition was treason. Often writing under the wonderful pen name “the Porcupine,” Karay was sent into internal exile in Anatolia by the imperial authorities and banished to Beirut and Aleppo by the republican government. He always made his way back into the outer reaches of the inner circle, however, and by the time multiparty politics appeared in the 1950s, Karay, “elder statesman of the dissidents,” had begun to carve out a novel, albeit precarious, space for the notion of the loyal opposition."

His picture is partial—he conducted fieldwork only in Sulaymaniyah, the capital of the autonomous Kurdistan Regional Government—but it is damning. Given the militarization of policing around the world since the end of the Cold War, the Bush administration’s decision to assign responsibility for rebuilding civilian policing to the U.S. Department of Defense and its Iraqi military counterparts may not be surprising, but it was a recipe for failure. Citizens were viewed as enemies to be thwarted rather than protected. Recruits were trained not to be police officers but to merely look like them: good at marching in formation, incompetent at actual police work. Ultimately, Wozniak concludes that what initially seemed like a bug was in fact a feature of the training programs. The “rejection of both best practices and scientific knowledge” of policing suggests that “the United States never had a fully formed democratic state in mind in the reconstruction of Iraq.”"
26,The Republic of False Truths,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-08-24/republic-false-truths,The Republic of False Truths,"The Egyptian novelist Aswany, author of the famed novel The Yacoubian Building, has taken for his canvas this time not just a single apartment block in Cairo but the entire Egyptian uprising of 2011. Aswany weaves a surprisingly nuanced and affecting portrait of the ill-fated revolution through a collection of stock characters: the pious, cruel, and self-important general; his rebellious daughter; her poor but virtuous medical-student boyfriend; the driver of a disillusioned businessman, who is in turn the patron of a young revolutionary; the smarmy imam who has a religious justification for every vice; and a thwarted actor, a Copt who has a love affair with his Muslim maid. A pervasive if invisible burden of fear—of God, of poverty, of social disapproval, of torture—weighs heavily on the story. These fears, provoked and manipulated by those whom Aswany sees as the revolt’s powerful opponents—the military establishment, corrupt business owners, and virtually all of the country’s religious authorities—eventually overwhelmed the daring and audacious, if naive, efforts of the revolutionaries to usher in a polity founded on freedom and social justice. Small wonder the book has been banned in Egypt and much of the rest of the Arab world."
27,Flowers Through Concrete: Explorations in Soviet Hippieland,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-08-24/flowers-through-concrete-explorations-soviet-hippieland,Flowers Through Concrete: Explorations in Soviet Hippieland,"In the late 1960s, a countercultural hippie movement began to emerge in the Soviet Union. Early Soviet hippies were inspired by the aesthetics of their Western counterparts, as well as their message of peace, love, and rock-and-roll. Within a few years, a network of hippies had evolved across the country. The communist state consistently eradicated independent social organization, and the hippies were no exception: the police and operatives of the Komsomol, a communist youth organization, persecuted them. The authorities often confined hippies to psychiatric hospitals. Fürst’s exhaustive history is based on 135 interviews with surviving hippies, as well as memoirs and personal archives. It is filled with colorful characters; documents their travels, gatherings, and spiritual quests; and boasts an amazing collection of photos. The book also includes tragic stories of drug abuse and dying young. Soviet hippies may have shared the antimaterialistic creed of Western hippies and rejected Soviet norms and values, but they were just as engaged as their “normal” Soviet contemporaries in procuring the coveted and expensive Western items that were missing in the Soviet economy (in their case, primarily blue jeans and music records). Fürst emphasizes that despite the hippies’ stubborn otherness, they were part of an increasingly complex late socialist society in which a broad range of “others” lived side by side with people deemed “normal.”"
28,Political Ideologies in Contemporary Russia,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-08-24/political-ideologies-contemporary-russia,Political Ideologies in Contemporary Russia,"Chebankova characterizes her work as a “theoretical study of Russia’s ideological foundations,” and the scope of the academic literature she cites is quite impressive. Unfortunately, the book’s description of the current scene in Russia has numerous inaccuracies, such as outdated affiliations of political and other figures and the mischaracterization of their current public standing. A more serious shortcoming is that Chebankova’s account of the Russian ideological and discursive environment is divorced from the social context: her analysis of the production of ideas does not differentiate dominant figures from marginal ones. Quotes from professional philosophers and political thinkers appear side by side with statements made by communications professionals, journalists, political commentators, filmmakers, and even pop culture figures. The author also disregards the political dynamics of the present day: for instance, although liberal ideas were fairly prominent in public discourse in the 1990s, in the 2010s, the Kremlin adopted a conservative discourse and radically marginalized its liberal opponents, smearing their reputations, jailing them, and forcing them out of Russia. The most striking example is the political activist Alexei Navalny, whom Chebankova identifies as belonging to a category she dubs “pluralist liberals.” The fact that Navalny (now imprisoned) was harassed for years goes unmentioned."

Her enthralling historical narrative is interspersed with dozens of individual stories of people uprooted by wars and revolutions. One wave consisted of prisoners of war and others the Nazis had deported from the territories they occupied in Poland and the Soviet Union to use as forced laborers in Germany. As the Cold War set in, Western organizations were eager to help those who sought to escape repatriation to the Soviet Union and increasingly regarded them as victims of communism rather than of Nazism. This meant looking the other way at false statements or forged identities, which often concealed histories of collaboration with the Germans. The other wave of immigrants were the White Russians who had settled in China after their defeat by the Reds in the Russian Civil War and who were forced to flee again in the late 1940s after the communist takeover of China. Australian authorities showed little kindness to Russian immigrants. They selected those who were young and healthy, separated men from women (making no exceptions for married couples), and required them to do hard manual labor for two years before starting on their own in their new country."
30,Beyond the Protest Square: Digital Media and Augmented Dissent,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-08-24/beyond-protest-square-digital-media-and-augmented-dissent,Beyond the Protest Square: Digital Media and Augmented Dissent,"Based on her research on the 2013–14 Euromaidan protests in Ukraine and the mass rallies against corruption that took place in 2017 in Russia, Lokot writes about the opportunities and limitations of digital technologies for protest movements and emphasizes the close entanglement of offline and online spaces. The book draws on state-of-the-art literature on the social role of digital technology and is academic in style but still a lively read, thanks to the numerous quotes from interviews that Lokot conducted with protesters. Digital communications were central in coordinating logistics at the protests in Kyiv, such as providing information on the availability of basic necessities, from toilets to WiFi to firewood. Live-streaming, tweeting, and blogging turned witnessing the protests into a form of participation. Countless videos recording the activities in the protest camp (cooking, singing, delivering lectures) created a public history of the uprising. Unlike in Ukraine, where the Internet is generally free, in Russia, the government has developed sophisticated technological means aimed at controlling the digital public sphere. It continues to adopt and enforce draconian regulations against activism, drawing no distinction between online and offline activities."
31,Comrade Kerensky,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-08-24/comrade-kerensky,Comrade Kerensky,"For a few months following the fall of the Russian monarchy in 1917, Alexander Kerensky, the minister of justice and then the military minister of the provisional government, was extolled as “the Leader of the People,” “the Minister of People’s Truth,” “the Champion of Freedom,” and “the Hero of the Revolution.” His public speeches attracted huge audiences that greeted him with standing ovations. Women threw flowers at him; soldiers and officers gave him their medals and jubilantly lifted him in the air. Kolonitskii examines Kerensky’s brief but cultish popularity through his speeches and contemporary accounts. Kerensky was a savvy politician and indefatigable coalition builder, but Kolonitskii credits his skill as a newsmaker to his keen sense of popular moods and his talent as a public speaker. The book’s narrative ends before the Bolshevik takeover in late 1917 and Kerensky’s subsequent escape from Russia. But the “cult” of Kerensky, Kolonitskii argues, provided a useful model for those who later created—and forcefully inculcated—the cults of Vladimir Lenin, Leon Trotsky, and Joseph Stalin."

Their sophisticated analyses examine the obstacles and external influences with which Caribbean economies must contend. The contributors underscore the region’s deep crisis: the rocky transition from plantation economies based on sugar to economies based mostly on tourism. The EU’s decision to end preferential treatment of the Caribbean shook the region, but so have climate change, natural disasters such as earthquakes and hurricanes, and the manmade calamities of drug trafficking and organized crime. Haiti’s economy has been especially hard hit, Puerto Rico went bankrupt, and Cuba still hasn’t recovered from the breakup of the Soviet Union. Guyana, with its new offshore oil discoveries, and the Dominican Republic, with its creditable economic performance, shine brightly in an otherwise depressing regional tableau. The islands’ attempt to find their niche in the world economy remains a work in progress."
33,Latecomer State Formation: Political Geography and Capacity Failure in Latin America,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-08-24/latecomer-state-formation-political-geography-and-capacity,Latecomer State Formation: Political Geography and Capacity Failure in Latin America,"In this extraordinarily ambitious tome, Mazzuca attributes the political and economic shortcomings of contemporary Latin America to the complex interactions of geography and history. He contrasts Latin American struggles with the European experience of state formation. In Europe, vulnerable midsize states had to learn how to fund armies and provide other public goods in order to survive. The new countries of nineteenth-century Latin America did not face the same level of external threats as their European counterparts. Instead of building internal state capacities, they focused on international trade, an economic model made possible by the free-trade capitalism of the era. The region’s export-led growth did not, by itself, preclude successful development—and here is perhaps Mazzuca’s most provocative insight. Development in Latin America slowed when dynamic commercial hubs in Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico annexed backward provinces that were governed by patronage machines that chronically sapped national treasuries. Smaller countries, such as Chile and Uruguay, escaped this fatal dysfunction but were held back by the recurrent crises in their larger neighbors. In a creative counterfactual, Mazzuca imagines a more viable midsize nation centered on Buenos Aires, Uruguay, southern Brazil, and the surrounding resource-rich pampas—a prosperous South American Australia."

His memoir, instead of peering into senior-level policymaking, offers a richly detailed, highly personal account of the uneasy intersection of U.S. grand strategy and stubborn realities on the ground. Tragen’s matter-of-fact descriptions of multiple U.S. missteps are all the more demoralizing given his cheerful personality and reluctance to question the basic precepts of U.S. policies. During the presidency of John F. Kennedy, Washington demanded immediate results in Latin America without addressing the deeply rooted causes of underdevelopment, which called for the patient construction of capable institutions. In Central America, Tragen witnessed the gut-wrenching consequences of U.S. backing for brutal anticommunist dictatorships. The war on drugs produced another frustrating mismatch between goals and resources. The incessant turnovers of leadership and staff in Washington and in host countries repeatedly undermined earnest efforts at long-term planning. Nevertheless, Tragen and his wife, Ele, built many bridges of friendship with their Latin American counterparts."

No single causal factor explains the rise of Jair Bolsonaro to the presidency. A former military officer and congressional backbencher, Bolsonaro tapped into several overflowing wells of societal discontent. A prolonged economic downturn had dashed the high hopes of the emerging Brazilian middle class. Identity politics advocating liberal positions on issues such as gay rights and abortion deeply offended the rapidly growing segment of Brazilians who identify as evangelical Christians. Ambitious cattle and soy farmers bristled against regulations protecting the Amazon rainforest and its indigenous peoples. Meanwhile, the mass media fueled disenchantment by highlighting government corruption scandals and frightening levels of violent crime. As president, Bolsonaro has maintained his aggressive, highly personalist style. Lapper finds that although Bolsonaro has polarized Brazilian society ahead of his reelection bid in 2022, the country’s institutions—the National Congress, the courts, mainstream media, and nongovernmental organizations—have remained resilient and have blocked much of the president’s reactionary social and economic agenda."

By 2016, flows of migrants from Mexico had already markedly diminished, a result of sharply declining fertility rates in Mexico, the 2008–9 recession in the United States, and tougher border enforcement and deportation policies. The authors assail Trump’s divisive racial politics and argue instead for public policies that strengthen societies on both sides of the border, focusing especially on a region referred to as Lasanti (Los Angeles, San Diego, and Tijuana). They call for expanded allotments of temporary work-based visas, transnational portable health-care insurance, and programs to increase college graduation rates among Latinos in California. Other chapters debunk popular myths, such as the idea that the North American Free Trade Agreement was to blame for large-scale unemployment in both Mexican agriculture and U.S. manufacturing. Looking forward, the contributors argue persuasively that strong national industrial and infrastructure policies, rather than trade accords, will speed future regional prosperity."

The group’s self-proclaimed caliph, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, knew better than to try. By 2014, when ISIS formalized its split from al Qaeda and established itself as the dominant player in the global Salafi-jihadi movement, Western security services had figured out how to make it effectively impossible for the group to establish a base of operations in Europe or North America. Like al Qaeda before it, ISIS was only ever present in the West in the form of disparate cells and sympathizers. A traditional terrorist organization—with a functioning bureaucracy, regular meeting places, and in-house propaganda production—would, Baghdadi and his henchmen understood, have had as little chance of surviving in a contemporary Western country as the proverbial snowball in hell."

Malkasian combines meticulous scholarship with a practitioner’s eye. It helps that he knows the country well, speaks Pashto, can navigate his way through the complex tribal structures that shape local politics, and has a good grasp of the Taliban’s attitudes and operations. The story he tells is a painful one. Successive U.S. administrations were unwilling to deal diplomatically with the Taliban because the militant group was either too weak or too strong, and Washington failed to put the effort and resources into building up the new Afghan government and army after 2001. The Bush administration’s focus in the early days of the post-9/11 invasion was on catching terrorists, which led to operations that killed civilians, resulting in a loss of support from the local population. In the end, despite their harsh ideology and brutal misogyny, the Taliban were able to sell themselves as authentically Afghan and resisting foreign occupation, whereas the government forces lacked conviction."

From his experience as a fighter pilot during the Korean War, he developed the so-called OODA loop—observe, orient, decide, act—as an approach to warfighting. In the 1970s and 1980s, he convinced senior U.S. policymakers of the need to abandon strategies based on attrition and embrace those based on sophisticated maneuvers instead. He drew heavily on accounts of how the German army had gained impressive victories during the World War II and on the work of the British military historian Basil Liddell Hart, who had urged an “indirect approach” to warfare to avoid deadly frontal assaults. But as Robinson reveals, the more that scholars learn about German operations and about Hart’s determination to fit all military history into his own simplistic framework, the flimsier Boyd’s thesis appears. Robinson carries out a meticulous demolition job that will be of interest to students of the Wehrmacht and to the U.S. Army and Marine Corps, demonstrating how grand theories with an emotional appeal can go a long way on the back of dubious history."

It is not an overstatement to assert, as the author does, that this weekend at Camp David was a historic turning point for the global economy. Drawing on archival sources and participant interviews, Garten recounts the unfolding drama, which inaugurated an era of greater exchange-rate flexibility and thereby opened the door to freer international capital mobility. At the same time, the demise of the Bretton Woods system changed some aspects of the global monetary and financial order less radically than anticipated at the time. In particular, the dollar, which under the Bretton Woods system enjoyed the “exorbitant privilege” of being the sun around which other currencies orbited, remains the dominant international and reserve currency even today."

He reminds the reader that although private markets are needed to ensure the ample supply of most goods and services, only governments can adequately provide collective goods such as pollution control and public health. He advocates using market mechanisms such as carbon taxes to offset externalities, applying this insight to multiple areas beyond carbon emissions and climate change. Such taxes would not be a drag on the economy; by correcting market failures, they would boost the rate of economic growth. Although Nordhaus emphasizes the indispensability of public policy intervention, coordinated at the international level, in the quest for a greener world, he also sees roles for private ethics and corporate social responsibility."
42,How Antitrust Failed Workers,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-08-24/how-antitrust-failed-workers,How Antitrust Failed Workers,"Antitrust enforcement in the United States, starting with the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890, has long focused on product-market competition and its antithesis, the monopoly provision of goods and services. In contrast, courts and regulators have largely neglected monopsony, where there exists one or a small handful of purchasers of goods and services, including labor services. Whether through noncompete clauses or simple market power, employers dominating local labor markets can depress wages and weaken worker protections. The author blames neglect of this issue on legal theorists’ nearly exclusive attention to consumer welfare and economists’ assumption that labor markets are generally competitive. He might have added a role for history and path dependence: antitrust efforts focus on monopoly today because they’ve focused on it for over a century. Posner concludes by showing that this imbalance can be righted within the existing legal framework if those responsible for antitrust policy wake up to the problem."

Keen and Slemrod, two leading public finance specialists, demonstrate that, in fact, taxes are anything but dull. Relying on historical vignettes, they show that taxation can have unintended consequences; they describe, in one instance, how the English window tax of 1696 led to dark, dank, and even windowless homes. Their book is also a reminder of the importance of getting history right. They explain, for example, that the Boston Tea Party was actually a revolt against lower taxes—not higher ones—which threatened the livelihood of American tea smugglers. Keen and Slemrod use these stories as a frame for thinking about the challenges of taxation today. They ask, for example, what genetic markers that reliably predicted a person’s lifetime income would mean for defining tax liabilities. In step with policymakers in the Biden administration, the authors point to the need for fundamental changes in how governments tax corporate profits in a world of footloose balance sheets. It is hard to imagine a more timely—and entertaining—history of the fisc."

Deudney challenges such hubris, arguing that far from delivering security, abundance, and freedom, space expansionism will exacerbate violence, inequality, and oppression, as great powers compete to dominate the ultimate “high ground,” commercial interests monopolize wealth, and tyranny flourishes both on earth and in the cold reaches of space. The nuclear arms race has been the biggest impetus behind human space activities. Why should the future be any different? The author quotes the philosopher Raymond Aron: “Short of a revolution in the heart of man and the nature of states, by what miracle could interplanetary space be preserved from military use?” Deudney predicts that untrammeled human expansion into space will ultimately result in “astrocide”—the destruction of earth from above—and the extinction of humanity. To avoid this fate, the world needs a multilateral agreement to strictly govern and limit expansion into space. Such an accord, like the famous “Earthrise” photograph taken by the Apollo 8 astronaut Bill Anders, would focus attention back where it belongs. Humanity’s destiny lies not in the stars, Deudney warns, but on “Oasis Earth.”"

Calder surveys these global cities, identifying the distinctive mix of political and functional characteristics that gives each one global reach and that forms what Calder calls a “penumbra of power.” These cities also foster grassroots movements for social justice and environmentalism. Mayors who have run them, such as New York City’s Michael Bloomberg and London’s Boris Johnson, have treated them as laboratories for innovation in areas such as transportation and public health. Calder shows that as nation-states grow more fragmented and struggle to carry out the basic tasks of government, global cities have found ways to set the international agenda and project influence by tackling the everyday problems of modern living. Nation-states will not disappear—but cities seem to be reasserting themselves, much as they did in the premodern era."

To illiberal populists, it is the elites who are the villains: globalists, bureaucrats, journalists, intellectuals, politicians. In this spirited polemic, Nichols argues the reverse: it is ordinary citizens who are failing the test of democracy. Populists fan the flames of fear and dissatisfaction, but it is the voters who put them in power. Nichols notes that in the twentieth century, liberal democracies survived multiple global conflicts, defeated fascism and totalitarianism, and weathered multiple depressions and recessions—and yet today, they seem unable to overcome less complex challenges, even within an overall context of relative peace and prosperity. Large segments of the publics in the United States and European countries have lost faith in democratic institutions, and growing numbers tell pollsters that they do not think it is “essential” to live in a democracy. Nichols argues that in an era of jaundiced self-absorption, citizens in Western societies have lost their appreciation of democratic values and the virtues of civic engagement. Still, Nichols acknowledges that any renewal of liberal democracy will rely on ordinary people, albeit ones who possess the civic knowledge and virtues needed to make the system work."

With an eye on today’s global convulsions, Potter seeks to illuminate the patterns formed by these disruptions. He notes that they all began with failures, dysfunctions, and mistakes made by defenders of the “old order” at the time. He argues that although the instability of large-scale political orders emerges from long-term economic and technological shifts, ideas and ideology matter just as much. The replacement of one world-shaping political order with another has always required strategy, leadership, and ideological struggles driven by the search for legitimacy. It is less the downtrodden and dispossessed who reshape political life than activists and charismatic leaders who latch on to potent new ideas and build new coalitions. Potter’s message to the defenders of the current era’s liberal order is to redouble their efforts to make the modern liberal state a professional servant of the people."

He has concluded that scholars were wrong to believe that democracy in advanced industrial societies could consolidate and resist backsliding. In fact, they can fall victim to what he calls “decay”: the slow erosion of liberal institutions by populist and authoritarian leaders who wrap themselves in the legitimacy of democracy but chip away at the rule of law, minority rights, and independent media. The information revolution was initially greeted as a friend of democracy, but its more ominous implications are now apparent, as China uses it for surveillance and political control and Russia uses it as a tool to destabilize Western institutions."

For some, the pandemic called that notion into question by suggesting that transnational threats pose an even greater danger to the American public than ascendant rival powers. Skeptics of great-power competition, such as Senator Bernie Sanders, an independent from Vermont, argued that the United States should seek to de-escalate tensions with China so that the two countries can work together to manage borderless risks such as pandemics and climate change."

But to anyone paying attention to U.S. foreign policy for the past decade, it has become obvious that the United States relies on one tool above all: economic sanctions."
51,From 9/11 to 1/6,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2021-08-24/war-on-terror-911-jan6,From 9/11 to 1/6,"Radical ideas that are today considered right-wing—white supremacism, violent antigovernment libertarianism, Christian extremism—have played starring roles in the American story since the very beginning. For most of the postwar era, however, the far right has mostly stayed underground, relegated to the fringes of American society. It never disappeared, of course, and in the early 1990s, it seemed poised for a resurgence after a series of confrontations that pitted the authorities against antigovernment militias and religious extremists—a phase that peaked with the 1995 terrorist bombing of a federal building in Oklahoma City by a white supremacist, antigovernment extremist, which killed 168 people."

53,The COVID Charter,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/africa/2021-08-24/covid-charter,The COVID Charter,"In August 1941, U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill met aboard the USS Augusta in the waters off Newfoundland to discuss the war then raging in Europe and Asia. As they considered the future, the two leaders remembered the past. The deprivations and divisions fueled by World War I and the Great Depression, they knew, had eventually led to the devastation of World War II."
54,Strategies of Restraint,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2021-08-24/strategies-restraint,Strategies of Restraint,"For nearly three decades after the end of the Cold War, U.S. foreign policy was characterized by a bipartisan consensus: that as the world’s “indispensable nation” and with no competitor, the United States had little choice but to pursue a transformational agenda on the world stage. Over the last few years, however, that consensus has collapsed. A growing chorus of voices are advocating a strategy of restraint—a less activist approach that focuses on diplomatic and economic engagement over military intervention. And they have found a receptive audience."
55,Who Won the War on Terror?,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/issue-packages/2021-08-24/who-won-war-terror,What’s Inside,"“This battle will take time and resolve,” President George W. Bush declared on September 12, 2001. “But make no mistake about it: we will win.” For much of the next two decades, pursuing victory in the “war on terror” would serve as the central fixation of American foreign policy. Yet even as the United States invaded two countries and launched drone strikes in others, as governments around the world erected vast security structures and attackers plotted with mixed success to evade them, as jihadi groups rose and fell and rose again, a basic question was never answered: What would it mean to “win”?"
56,North Korea’s Nuclear Family,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/north-korea/2021-08-24/north-koreas-nuclear-family,North Korea’s Nuclear Family,"When the Biden administration, following a months-long review, announced its North Korea policy this past April—“diplomacy, as well as stern deterrence”—the news barely registered. The question of how to deal with the nuclear-armed pariah state, a matter never resolved but never fully escalating into an existential threat, has dogged a long succession of U.S. administrations. The prevailing sense today, amid a pandemic and heightened great-power tension, seems to be that Washington has bigger fish to fry and more urgent crises to focus on."
57,Winning Ugly,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/middle-east/2021-08-24/winning-ugly,Winning Ugly,"My first mission as a paramilitary officer with the CIA was against a top-ten al Qaeda target. It was the autumn of 2009, and I had been deployed in my new job for a total of two days. But I was no stranger to Afghanistan, having already fought there (as well as in Iraq) as a Marine Corps officer over the previous six years. On this mission, I was joined by the Afghan counterterrorism unit I advised and a handful of members from SEAL Team Six. Our plan was to conduct a raid to capture or kill our target, who was coming across the border from Pakistan for a meeting in the Korengal Valley."
58,Them and Us,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2021-08-24/foreign-policy-them-and-us,Them and Us,"No twenty-first-century event has shaped the United States and its role in the world as much as 9/11. The attacks pierced the complacency of the post–Cold War decade and shattered the illusion that history was ending with the triumph of American-led globalization. The scale of the U.S. response remade American government, foreign policy, politics, and society in ways that continue to generate aftershocks. Only by interrogating the excesses of that response can Americans understand what their country has become and where it needs to go."

60,The Case for Complacency,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/review-essay/2021-08-24/case-complacency,The Case for Complacency,"As U.S. President Joe Biden seeks to resurrect American leadership on the world stage, the perennial question of how the United States should respond to international crises looms large. In his latest book, the political scientist John Mueller offers a refreshingly straightforward answer: Washington should aim not for transformation but for “complacency,” which Mueller characterizes as “minimally effortful national strategy in the security realm.”"
61,Beijing’s American Hustle,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/asia/2021-08-23/beijings-american-hustle,Beijing’s American Hustle,"Although many Americans were slow to realize it, Beijing’s enmity for Washington began long before U.S. President Donald Trump’s election in 2016 and even prior to Chinese President Xi Jinping’s rise to power in 2012. Ever since taking power in 1949, the ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has cast the United States as an antagonist. But three decades ago, at the end of the Cold War, Chinese leaders elevated the United States from just one among many antagonists to their country’s primary external adversary—and began quietly revising Chinese grand strategy, embarking on a quest for regional and then global dominance."
62,The Good Enough Doctrine,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/middle-east/2021-08-24/good-enough-doctrine,The Good Enough Doctrine,"In the 20 years since the 9/11 attack, U.S. counterterrorism policy has achieved some striking successes and suffered some horrific failures. On the positive side, jihadi organizations such as al Qaeda and the Islamic State (also known as ISIS) are now shadows of their former selves, and the United States has avoided another catastrophic, 9/11-scale attack. The worst fears, or even the more modest ones, of U.S. counterterrorism officials have not been realized. With terrorism less of an immediate concern, U.S. President Joe Biden has turned Washington’s focus toward China, climate change, and other issues—even withdrawing U.S. troops from Afghanistan as part of an effort to end the so-called forever wars."
63,Bin Laden’s Catastrophic Success,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/afghanistan/2021-08-13/osama-bin-ladens-911-catastrophic-success,Bin Laden’s Catastrophic Success,"On September 11, 2001, al Qaeda carried out the deadliest foreign terrorist attack the United States had ever experienced. To Osama bin Laden and the other men who planned it, however, the assault was no mere act of terrorism. To them, it represented something far grander: the opening salvo of a campaign of revolutionary violence that would usher in a new historical era. Although bin Laden was inspired by religion, his aims were geopolitical. Al Qaeda’s mission was to undermine the contemporary world order of nation-states and re-create the historical umma, the worldwide community of Muslims that was once held together by a common political authority. Bin Laden believed that he could achieve that goal by delivering what he described as a “decisive blow” that would force the United States to withdraw its military forces from Muslim-majority states, thus allowing jihadis to fight autocratic regimes in those places on a level playing field."

65,Iran’s War Within,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/iran/2021-08-05/irans-war-within-ebrahim-raisi,Iran’s War Within,"The Islamic Republic of Iran is a state divided against itself. Since its inception in 1979, it has been defined by tension between the president, who heads its elected government, and the supreme leader, who leads the parallel state institutions that embody modern Iran’s revolutionary Islamist ideals. The current supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, served as president from 1981 to 1989. During his tenure as president, he clashed over matters of policy, personnel, and ideology with the supreme leader at the time, Ruhollah Khomeini, the charismatic cleric who had spearheaded the Iranian Revolution. After Khomeini died, in 1989, Khamenei was appointed supreme leader and went on to do battle with a long line of presidents more moderate than himself."

0,America’s Forgotten Wars,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/issue-packages/2017-09-27/americas-forgotten-wars,What’s Inside,"You don’t hear much about it in the media, but American forces are waging several conflicts around the world these days. As Washington obsesses over soap operas and scandals, the actual work of maintaining global order continues under the radar. The result is a national security discourse that looks like a mullet: business at the front, party in the back. Our lead package this issue is an attempt to redress the balance, giving U.S. interventions the serious scrutiny they deserve. Think of it as a journey back to the front. We asked top experts on six key conflicts to sketch where things are, where they are going, and what the United States should do next—and we’re delighted to bring you their answers. Kosh Sadat and Stan McChrystal explain why pursuing some form of the current U.S. strategy in Afghanistan continues to be the least bad option there, even though nobody is particularly happy with the results to date. Emma Sky and Robert Ford bring their wealth of experience to bear on the post-ISIS landscape in Iraq and Syria, respectively, with Sky advising Washington to focus on local politics and institution building while Ford suggests curtailing most engagement beyond refugee assistance. Ivo Daalder tackles the new eastern front, arguing that given Russia’s actions in Ukraine, the Middle East, and elsewhere, the United States and its nato allies should focus on preventing miscalculations and unintended escalation. And Lisa Monaco and Susan Hennessey explore the more amorphous realms of terrorism and cyberwarfare, respectively, arguing that international cooperation, restored deterrence, and calibrated pushback can help contain these complex and enduring threats. U.S. foreign policy is apparently taking a gap year. Inexperienced, understaffed, and lacking a coherent grand strategy, the Trump administration has generally reacted to global events rather than driven them, engaging the world episodically and idiosyncratically. Some issues, however—like the ones covered here—are simply too important to be pushed to a back burner or delegated to staff wearing uniforms. Eventually, attention must be paid."
1,Room for Everyone,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/world/2017-10-16/room-everyone,Room for Everyone,"The World Health Organization’s newly elected director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, points out that epidemics and pandemics are a major threat to global health “because viruses don’t respect borders, and they don’t need visas” (“Global Health Gets a Checkup,” September/October 2017). He also mentions that the core mission of the WHO is to increase health coverage so as to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals’ aim to “leave no one behind.” His efforts, however, could be undermined by political interference."
2,A Kinder Truman Doctrine,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2017-10-16/kinder-truman-doctrine,A Kinder Truman Doctrine,"I am delighted to see Senator Tim Kaine (“A New Truman Doctrine,” July/August 2017) describe a bold new foreign policy strategy that balances greatness and goodness. He should further develop his proposal in two important ways."
3,Intimate Interventions in Global Health: Family Planning and HIV Prevention in Sub-Saharan Africa,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2017-10-16/intimate-interventions-global-health-family-planning-and-hiv,Intimate Interventions in Global Health: Family Planning and HIV Prevention in Sub-Saharan Africa,"Robinson argues that African countries’ responses to the HIV/AIDS crisis have been largely determined by their previous experiences in implementing family-planning programs. Based on careful case studies of Malawi, Nigeria, and Senegal, she documents how the same local nongovernmental organizations and technocrats that had gained experience and developed working relationships with international family-planning organizations, such as Family Health International (now FHI 360) and the International Planned Parenthood Federation, were typically the same actors who spearheaded efforts to combat HIV/AIDS. Preventing pregnancies and preventing the spread of HIV require the same ability to intervene in intimate relations and influence sexual practices. Robinson convincingly demonstrates that the effectiveness of a given family-planning program depended on whether the political conditions allowed for the development of relatively strong nonstate actors with links to transnational agencies. Against conventional wisdom, this fine study conveys an abiding optimism about the ability of large international aid organizations to help smaller local groups build skills in one area and then apply them to other challenges."
4,Infrastructure in Africa: Lessons for Future Development,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2017-10-16/infrastructure-africa-lessons-future-development,Infrastructure in Africa: Lessons for Future Development,"The African continent’s generally woeful infrastructure has long acted as a brake on economic growth and poverty alleviation in the region. Better roads would help African farmers get their crops to markets. Better sanitation would significantly improve public health. Cheaper and more reliable electric power would allow manufacturing sectors to expand. This collection of essays by economists associated with the African Development Bank suggests ways to achieve those outcomes. The main idea: more public spending. The authors estimate that the region’s governments currently spend less than half of the $93 billion a year they need to on infrastructure investment and maintenance. The difficulty in bridging this funding gap stems not just from a lack of money but also from a paucity of proposals for well-defined, bankable projects."
5,"Violent Non-State Actors in Africa: Terrorists, Rebels and Warlords",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2017-10-16/violent-non-state-actors-africa-terrorists-rebels-and-warlords,"Violent Non-State Actors in Africa: Terrorists, Rebels and Warlords","The best chapters in this volume on violent nonstate actors across Africa describe contemporary groups that remain understudied and poorly documented: for example, the various militias fighting in the Central African Republic, the Islamic State (also known as ISIS) in Libya, and the armed factions that briefly formed a jihadist statelet in northern Mali in 2012. One depressing message the book delivers is that a good deal of continuity exists when it comes to the emergence of these kinds of violent groups. Decade after decade, extremists continue to exploit the continent’s dire poverty and underperforming, illegitimate regimes. The names and the rhetoric change, but the essential qualities stay the same. In her succinct and useful introduction to the book, Varin suggests, however, that one significant change has occurred: newer groups, such as Boko Haram in Nigeria and al Shabab in Somalia, commit even more senseless, gratuitous violence than earlier groups, which were often brutal but were reined in to an extent by a combination of stronger chains of command, clearer ideologies, and more significant foreign support."
6,The Horn of Africa: State Formation and Decay,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2017-10-16/horn-africa-state-formation-and-decay,The Horn of Africa: State Formation and Decay,"Clapham has produced a sharp political history of Eritrea, Ethiopia, and Somalia. (Unfortunately, his book largely ignores Djibouti, the fourth country located in the Horn of Africa.) He walks the reader through a complex story of uneven state building and civil war that begins in the nineteenth century and extends to the present. To explain the variation in political outcomes in the region, Clapham turns to geography. He contrasts the region’s highlands, where relatively high population density and fertile soil have produced agricultural surpluses that can finance a viable state such as Ethiopia, with the lowlands, in which pastoralism dominates and has undermined the establishment of state authority in Somalia. Clapham sensibly puts Ethiopia at the center of his narrative: with a large population and a relatively strong state, the country was able to fight off European attempts to colonize it and has long acted as the region’s hegemon, although its neighbors have always viewed it with great suspicion. The book deftly describes how Ethiopia has emerged from recent crises with a stable government (albeit one led by military rulers) and ambitions to become Africa’s first “developmental state,” fostering growth with major infrastructure projects that have the potential to dramatically change the region."
7,Julius Nyerere,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2017-10-16/julius-nyerere,Julius Nyerere,"Julius Nyerere, who in the 1960s served as prime minister and then president of the state that would become Tanzania and then served as independent Tanzania’s first president, until 1985, was one of the dominant personalities of African politics during the second half of the twentieth century. This short, accessible biography provides an excellent introduction to his life and to the country that he ruled. Born in 1922, he was identified as a promising pupil in a Catholic mission school and later became one of the first Tanzanians to earn a college degree. That distinction, along with his keen grasp of political tactics and his talent for rhetoric, thrust him into a leadership position in the burgeoning nationalist movement. Nicknamed Mwalimu (“teacher” in Swahili), Nyerere earned a reputation for being a thoughtful and visionary socialist whose high degree of personal integrity was not matched by many other African heads of state at the time. Bjerk’s balanced biography lauds Nyerere’s accomplishments (most notably the steps he took to reduce ethnic and racial divisions within Tanzania) but also makes clear that the Nyerere regime committed human rights violations, tolerated a good deal of corruption, and implemented disastrous economic policies that left the country bankrupt by the mid-1980s."
8,China's Governance Puzzle: Enabling Transparency and Participation in a Single-Party State,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2017-10-16/chinas-governance-puzzle-enabling-transparency-and-participation,China’s Governance Puzzle: Enabling Transparency and Participation in a Single-Party State,"The American authors of this valuable study benefited from their collaboration with a number of scholars at Chinese universities and think tanks. They set out to demonstrate that even within China’s closed regime, it is possible to advance transparency and public participation, often through small experiments that are subsequently scaled up. Why would an authoritarian party permit such changes? That is the puzzle of the book’s title. According to the authors, the central state does so to reduce corruption and improve compliance with its policies at the local level. But the authors worry that under Chinese President Xi Jinping, the Chinese Communist Party is backpedaling on earlier reforms and instead favoring “coercive, top-down approaches.” Xi’s anticorruption campaign is a case in point. The authors skillfully blend the latest statistics on corruption with illuminating case studies to argue that enlisting the Chinese public to monitor the bureaucracy would yield better results than continuing the current heavy-handed crackdown that targets corrupt individuals one at a time."
9,Purifying the Land of the Pure: A History of Pakistan's Religious Minorities,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2017-10-16/purifying-land-pure-history-pakistans-religious-minorities,Purifying the Land of the Pure: A History of Pakistan’s Religious Minorities,"Founded in 1947 as a Muslim homeland but a secular state, Pakistan quickly descended into internal violence as the search for Islamic purity set Muslims against non-Muslims, Sunnis against Shiites and Ahmadis, and various Sunni sects against one another. Ispahani is a journalist and former aide to the secularist leader Benazir Bhutto, who served as prime minister from 1988 to 1990 and again from 1993 to 1996 and who was assassinated in 2007. The author places much of the blame for Pakistan’s ever-worsening intolerance on a series of military men turned politicians who fostered sectarian oppression in pursuit of political gain. Her prime villain is Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq, who took power in a coup in 1977 and ruled until 1988 and who instituted a vague law against “blasphemy” that is still widely used to persecute innocent people. The coalition he assembled included the intelligence and military agencies (who saw jihadists as useful tools to extend Pakistani influence into Afghanistan and Kashmir), the Punjabi landholding elite (who saw fundamentalism as a tool to mobilize voters), Saudi Arabia (which saw Sunni Pakistan as a bulwark against Shiite Iran), and the United States (which tolerated human rights violations because of Pakistan’s cooperation in fighting the Soviets in Afghanistan). Unfortunately, this coalition has mostly held."
10,Architects of Occupation: American Experts and Planning for Postwar Japan,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2017-10-16/architects-occupation-american-experts-and-planning-postwar-japan,Architects of Occupation: American Experts and Planning for Postwar Japan,"The U.S.-led Allied occupation of Japan after World War II is considered a strategic success because it placed a formerly militaristic, aggressive enemy firmly on the road to democracy, prosperity, and an alliance with the United States. Barnes shows that the planning for the occupation started as early as 1939. (The Council on Foreign Relations played a prominent, although unofficial, role.) It was far from obvious in advance whether or how Japan would be defeated or what to do if it was. One faction, led by some of the U.S. State Department’s leading Asia experts, held that the Japanese were culturally impervious to Western worldviews and inherently aggressive, and so Japan had to be reduced to impotence to make the world safe. The other view was that Japan’s aggression had been stimulated by resource insecurity, and so integrating the country into open global markets would be the key to peace. Barnes’ engaging intellectual and social history of the planners provides a fresh window into the origins of today’s liberal international order."
11,Samurai to Soldier: Remaking Military Service in Nineteenth-Century Japan,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2017-10-16/samurai-soldier-remaking-military-service-nineteenth-century,Samurai to Soldier: Remaking Military Service in Nineteenth-Century Japan,"More than two centuries of peace, stretching from the early 1600s to the mid-1800s, left Japanese samurai more skilled in martial arts than in martial action. Jaundrill’s impressively researched study traces the origin of the modern Japanese military to the 1840s, when one martial arts teacher introduced a more westernized style of musketry and artillery training based on the Dutch example. Samurai aristocrats resisted such regimentation. But the West’s relentless encroachment, together with internal battles between modernizing reformers and conservative feudal lords, kept up the pressure to create more effective fighting units. Soon after reformists took power in the 1868 Meiji Restoration, the new regime adopted a universal conscription law, breaking the link between service in the military and social status and consolidating the idea of a mass citizenry. By 1894, Japan was poised to defeat Qing China and win control of Korea and Taiwan."
12,Assignment: China,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2017-10-16/assignment-china,Assignment: China,"This 12-chapter documentary series, reported by the former CNN Asia correspondent Mike Chinoy, surveys the history of the U.S. media’s reporting on China. It includes contentious episodes such as the Time reporter Theodore White’s struggle with the publisher Henry Luce over how to portray the Chinese leader Chiang Kai-shek during World War II and Bloomberg News’ 2013 decision to fire the reporter Michael Forsythe because, Forsythe says, his research into the wealth of Chinese elites had angered the Chinese regime, threatening the expansion of Bloomberg’s business in China. (Bloomberg has denied this.) Viewers who are new to the China story will get a vivid primer on 70 years of political, social, and economic change through the eyes of journalists who covered it. As China followed a twisting path from war to Maoist revolution to its present state of prosperity and assertiveness, American correspondents faced ever-changing challenges. Still, wave after wave of reporters understood the importance of the story and covered it with remarkable insight."
13,Sold People: Traffickers and Family Life in North China,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2017-10-16/sold-people-traffickers-and-family-life-north-china,Sold People: Traffickers and Family Life in North China,"Making innovative use of police and court archives dating from the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, Ransmeier shows that Chinese families often bought and sold family members. Some families purchased male children to adopt as heirs. Others bought young girls to serve as future brides for their sons. Still others indentured children to work as servants or purchased children, women, and disabled people to serve as beggars, laborers, or prostitutes or to be sold on the international “coolie” market. For every buyer, there was a seller, usually driven by need—except in cases where traffickers snatched people off the street. Modernizing officials outlawed some but not all of these practices; many forms of buying and selling were covered by a veneer of kinship. China today still suffers from widespread human trafficking. Ransmeier’s richly detailed stories of individual cases show how societies can come to accept the trade in people as a normal kind of business."
14,Transforming Patriarchy: Chinese Families in the Twenty-First Century,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2017-10-16/transforming-patriarchy-chinese-families-twenty-first-century,Transforming Patriarchy: Chinese Families in the Twenty-First Century,"The anthropological perspective on Chinese family life adopted by the contributors to this volume reveals a great deal of interesting variation—across the urban-rural divide; according to region, class, and sexual orientation; and even just by personality and circumstance. But a pattern emerges. The Chinese family is changing under the impact of many forces, including marketization, urbanization, reduced family size, consumerism, and loosening sexual mores. There is more personal choice in marriage, families are smaller, and elders today rely less on their children to take care of them than in the past. Daughters are more valued than they used to be, because the housing and gifts that must be purchased to marry off a son are more expensive, and because daughters are more likely than sons to help their parents in old age. Yet tradition still weighs heavily. Between what the editors of this volume call “the two axes of patriarchy,” the power of elders has weakened more than the dominance of males."
15,Rising China's Influence in Developing Asia,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2017-10-16/rising-chinas-influence-developing-asia,Rising China’s Influence in Developing Asia,"Even as China’s power increases, the country does not always get what it wants from its regional neighbors. Goh and her contributors explore the complex interplay of pressure and resistance in China’s relations with Myanmar, North Korea, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, and Vietnam, as well as China’s role in regional issues such as dam building, monetary policy, and human rights. These interesting essays go beyond the standard chronology of diplomatic interactions to probe factors that amplify or impede Chinese influence. China’s neighbors may cooperate for economic gain, or to manage troublesome borders, or simply because they share China’s preferences. When necessary, they yield to China’s superior force. But they also fear Chinese dominance and tend to side with India, Japan, and especially the United States whenever those powers are available. Domestic politics in these countries also play a role. Corruption may make it easier for China to gain access to local decision-makers, but it can also generate scandal. Pro- and anti-China factions often form in these countries, and Beijing’s gains can be reversed because of shifts in public opinion or leadership."
16,Political Islam in Tunisia: The History of Ennahda,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2017-10-16/political-islam-tunisia-history-ennahda,Political Islam in Tunisia: The History of Ennahda,"Are Rached Ghannouchi and his Ennahda Party in Tunisia true democrats or merely tactical ones? Wolf spent four years and conducted 400 interviews trying to answer that question. She declines to give a definitive judgment but hints that the commitment to democracy may be more opportunistic than doctrinal. Ghannouchi is at the liberal end of the Ennahda spectrum, and the party’s rank and file may not be with him. Wolf stresses, however, that Tunisia’s political culture is rooted in a history of reform, and Ennahda likes to cast itself as the inheritor of the reformist mantle. After decades of repression, Ennahda began to operate legally only in 2011, when a broad-based revolt drove President Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali from power. Since then, the party has grappled with issues such as the tension between civil and religious law and the question of whether Muslims and non-Muslims should be considered equal under the law. Aside from a lack of internal consensus on such questions, Ennahda’s main weakness, Wolf contends, is its failure to put forward an explicit economic philosophy."
17,The New Sultan: Erdogan and the Crisis of Modern Turkey,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2017-10-16/new-sultan-erdogan-and-crisis-modern-turkey,The New Sultan: Erdogan and the Crisis of Modern Turkey,"Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Turkey’s leader since 2003, has had an impact on the republic arguably equal to that of its transformational founder, Kemal Ataturk. Turkey’s economy has boomed under Erdogan; its middle class has tripled in size during his rule and now includes around 40 percent of the population. But Cagaptay sees Erdogan as a deeply flawed figure who threatens Turkey’s democracy. After the economic troubles of the 1990s, Erdogan, whose politics are shaped by an uneasy mix of Islamism and constitutional secularism, consolidated a center-right coalition of pro-market and Islamist supporters that has never quite exceeded 50 percent of the electorate. After the 2007 election, in which his Justice and Development Party, known as the AKP, came close to receiving a majority, Erdogan began to eliminate all checks on his power: the military, the press, and the judiciary were all suborned. At first, Erdogan was aided by Fethullah Gulen, an influential cleric with many followers in the security establishment. But in 2013, Erdogan broke with the Gulenists. In 2016, a failed coup allegedly organized by Gulenists gave Erdogan a pretext to purge the government, academia, and the media of not only Gulenists but also liberals and Kurds. Only an economic downturn could now loosen his grip on power."
18,Citizen Hariri: Lebanon's Neo-Liberal Reconstruction,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2017-10-16/citizen-hariri-lebanons-neo-liberal-reconstruction,Citizen Hariri: Lebanon’s Neo-Liberal Reconstruction,"Rafiq Hariri was twice Lebanon’s prime minister, first from 1992 to 1998 and again from 2000 to 2004. Hariri, a Sunni Lebanese billionaire who made his fortune in the construction business in Saudi Arabia, was the primary force behind Beirut’s reconstruction after the long Lebanese civil war, which ended in 1989. (He was also a trustee and benefactor of the American University of Beirut, where I served as president from 1998 until 2008.) Hariri was assassinated in a massive blast in Beirut in 2005 that killed dozens of people and that a UN special tribunal has blamed on members of the Shiite militia Hezbollah. Baumann focuses on Hariri’s economic reforms, specifically his program of acquiring undervalued property in Beirut and redeveloping it and his pegging of the Lebanese pound to the U.S. dollar. He argues that such policies exploited the state’s power to engineer a huge transfer of wealth from ordinary Lebanese to oligarchs such as Hariri himself, many of them based in Gulf Arab states. The story is well told, but Baumann crowds too much under the umbrella term “neoliberalism.” The Gulf-based oligarchs, for example, did not need Lebanon to make their fortunes, which were more directly affected by oil prices than by the Beirut property market."
19,"Losing an Enemy: Obama, Iran, and the Triumph of Diplomacy",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2017-10-16/losing-enemy-obama-iran-and-triumph-diplomacy,"Losing an Enemy: Obama, Iran, and the Triumph of Diplomacy","Parsi has written a detailed and gripping account of the 22 months of negotiations over Iran’s nuclear program that resulted in the 2015 deal struck by the Islamic Republic and the permanent members of the UN Security Council plus Germany (known as the P5+1). Iran pledged to eliminate its stockpiles of uranium, drastically limit its enrichment activities, and allow inspections of its nuclear facilities. In exchange, the P5+1 agreed to lift crippling sanctions on Iran. Parsi did not participate in the negotiations but has interviewed just about everyone who did. His book captures the ebb and flow of the process—indeed, its psychology. The United States saw sanctions as a way to force Iran to negotiate; Iran saw enrichment as a way to force the United States to negotiate. Neither wanted to put down its stick. There is no doubt in Parsi’s mind that the only alternative to the deal was war, which was U.S. President Barack Obama’s position, as well. Further sanctions would not have produced regime change in Tehran, Parsi contends. He also does not believe that Iran—a big, diverse, proud nation—could be isolated indefinitely. The Trump administration may think otherwise, but Parsi presents a convincing argument that normalization with Iran, although not inevitable, is possible."
20,Democratic Transitions in the Arab World,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2017-10-16/democratic-transitions-arab-world,Democratic Transitions in the Arab World,"This important collection follows an earlier edited volume that Elbadawi and Makdisi put together prior to the Arab uprisings of 2010–11. That book explored the “democracy deficit” in the Arab world. For decades, the region’s autocracies defied predictions that growing wealth, rising levels of education, and the development of middle classes would lead to democratic transitions. In their contribution to the book, Elbadawi and Makdisi persuasively argued that the deficit derived from a combination of war and the wealth afforded autocrats by natural resources. The uprisings briefly raised the possibility that the deficit would be overcome. But in the eyes of most experts, civil war and the reassertion of autocracy have crushed those hopes (except in Tunisia, where a fragile democracy arose after the upheaval). Nevertheless, in their new volume, Elbadawi and Makdisi conclude that the process of democratic transition that began in 2011 will resume at some point and that Islamist fundamentalism will not emerge as the dominant political paradigm in the medium or long term. The other contributors, all Arab academics, generally make similar arguments in useful sketches of particular countries, including Egypt, Lebanon, and Syria. The trouble is that, outside Tunisia, there is not much empirical evidence to support such optimism."
21,The House of Government: A Saga of the Russian Revolution,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2017-10-16/house-government-saga-russian-revolution,The House of Government: A Saga of the Russian Revolution,"Slezkine builds the core of this epic narrative around the lives of a stunning cast of Soviet personalities in the period from the Russian Revolution through the aftermath of World War II. The main characters are the residents of the House of Government, an immense edifice in Moscow, completed in 1931, that housed the Soviet elite. He traces their lives, often in their own words, from youthful idealism and ardent revolutionary fervor to disillusionment and prosaic surrender to pragmatism—and, for a vast portion of the protagonists, exile or death during Stalin’s terror. The book is richly layered and multifaceted: it offers a philosophical reflection on religion and its relationship to the intellectual underpinnings of the Russian Revolution, a political and biographical history of the first half of the twentieth century, a study of the period’s key literary texts, and an extensive assessment of Stalinist architecture. The book’s depth (not to mention its length) invites the reader to luxuriate in it, chapter by chapter, rather than simply plowing through."

The seditious emotions that would later inspire political terror, she suggests, first appeared in Aleksandr Radishchev’s 1790 Journey From St. Petersburg to Moscow. It then gestated in the work of authors such as Turgenev and Dostoyevsky (and, even more boldly, in that of their less famous but more radical counterparts, Sergei Nechaev and Nikolai Chernyshevsky), who depicted revolutionary zeal and its terrorist strain. Although Patyk draws on the works of many authors to subtly tease out the symbiosis between words and deeds, her central focus is Dostoyevsky’s three great novels Crime and Punishment, Demons, and The Brothers Karamazov, which gave terrorism literary form well before it became a fixture of modern politics."

This problem attracts intense scrutiny from those studying and promoting economic reform. Normally, scholars draw a sharp correlation between secure property rights and the strength and integrity of political and legal institutions. Most analysts assume that if those institutions are weak or corrupt, people and groups struggling to protect their property will resort to criminal or corrupt means. Gans-Morse, employing survey data and extensive interviews, turns that assumption upside down. In this valuable, original take on an important subject, he demonstrates that even when faced with imperfect legal remedies, Russians increasingly use the courts when the costs of criminal or corrupt alternatives are too high or the returns insufficient. Despite lagging efforts to improve Russian courts and state bureaucracies, a great many disputes over ownership and contracts are settled by legal means. This trend, however, has advanced unevenly, and the level of engagement with the legal system often depends on the size of the firms involved, the nature of their products, and the character of the markets in which they operate."

It is now mired in corruption, political dysfunction, and economic stagnation. Pelkmans paints an earthy portrait of how people in one Kyrgyz city, a former mining town of 20,000 inhabitants, have coped. Half of them have fled. Those who stayed have adopted a variety of credos to help them understand their new world. Initially, many hewed to neoliberalism, which promised a future of democracy and prospering markets. When those dreams failed to materialize, people drifted to alternatives, including nationalism and religion, with conservative Islam (ushered in by Tablighi Jamaat, a proselytizing group that encourages personal piety), Pentecostal Christianity, and shamanistic spiritual healing all enjoying a surge in popularity. Pelkmans focuses on the swift cycle in which these belief systems gained purchase over people and generated enthusiasm and energy, which then deflated when prophets failed and outcomes disappointed. He is interested in not merely the force of ideas but also what determines their influence, durability, and decline."
25,Communism's Shadow: Historical Legacies and Contemporary Political Attitudes,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2017-10-16/communisms-shadow-historical-legacies-and-contemporary-political,Communism’s Shadow: Historical Legacies and Contemporary Political Attitudes,"In this immensely ambitious, careful, and data-rich study, Pop-Eleches and Tucker do not merely explore the historical legacy of communism in eastern Europe; they also tackle the far more difficult problem of distinguishing its impact from that of other factors. They compare contemporary attitudes in postcommunist countries with those in societies never ruled by communist regimes on issues such as democracy and market-based economics (less support in postcommunist states), government-funded social welfare programs (more support in postcommunist states), and gender equality (not much difference between the two groups). It is often hard to determine how much those differences are due to the communist past rather than historical features that predated communism or factors that transcend the nature of political systems, such as what the authors refer to as “geographic location.” But Pop-Eleches and Tucker succeed in that task by applying a highly refined theoretical model to their large data sets. Those trying to pin down with greater precision the legacy of communism now have a model to emulate."
26,The NGO Game: Post-Conflict Peacebuilding in the Balkans and Beyond,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2017-10-16/ngo-game-post-conflict-peacebuilding-balkans-and-beyond,The NGO Game: Post-Conflict Peacebuilding in the Balkans and Beyond,"McMahon has produced a detailed, tough-minded study of what happened when a swarm of nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) rushed into Bosnia and Kosovo in the wake of conflicts during the 1990s. She argues that, despite their good intentions and hard work, their actual contribution to postconflict peace building was largely insignificant—or even counterproductive. Rather than generate local initiative, create community, strengthen civil society, or foster democracy, they left locals despairing of change, cynical, and disdainful of the NGO model. This, she says, is because of a perverse interaction between international and local NGOs. International groups and the governments and global institutions that supported them had the money, but their aims did not match the reality on the ground. Making matters worse, they relied on self-serving measures of success and disregarded the insights and preferences of their local counterparts. Those counterparts soon figured out that to get funding, they had to design their programs according to international priorities rather than genuine local needs. Bust followed boom as failure and exhaustion set in; international NGOs moved on, and local NGOs withered. Many within the NGO community now understand these problems, but McMahon fears that too many incentives exist to leave things as they are."
27,"Home—So Different, So Appealing",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2017-10-16/home-so-different-so-appealing,"Home—So Different, So Appealing","Forty-two Latino and Latin American artists present a mostly grim view of low-income urban life and reduced opportunity, whether in the shantytowns of Bogotá and Buenos Aires or the housing projects of the Bronx. The exhibition, organized by LACMA, the UCLA Chicano Studies Research Center, and the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, includes works in many media—drawings, paintings, photographs, installations, videos—and encourages the viewer to see mundane domestic objects as artifacts laden with historical and psychological meaning. But the overwhelming, strident political commentary is disturbingly pessimistic. Ugly slums brutalize vulnerable children, loudly flapping buzzards loom over heaps of trash, jarring inequalities separate the prosperous from the impoverished. Latino immigrants to the United States confront class divisions, bogus patriotism, and long, wrenching jail sentences. New single-family housing developments in Mexico and the United States alike appear as bleak, dehumanized wastelands of consumerism. In these artists’ eyes, the American dream is an illusion, and there is no exit from the Western Hemisphere’s social nightmares. Ironically, these images of despair are more akin to U.S. President Donald Trump’s vision of “American carnage” than to Barack Obama’s “audacity of hope.”"
28,Fractured Utopias: A Personal Odyssey with History,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2017-10-16/fractured-utopias-personal-odyssey-history,Fractured Utopias: A Personal Odyssey with History,"Burbach, who passed away in 2015, was a self-styled “utopian intellectual vagabond” who had fled his Midwestern origins to struggle alongside left-wing comrades striving to remake their worlds, most intensely in Chile during the Allende years, in the early 1970s, and in Sandinista Nicaragua, in the 1980s. In this posthumously published memoir, he blends tales of dramatic political upheaval and stories of libertine liaisons: “Passion and eroticism can be part of the longing for Utopia,” he notes. Burbach was an erudite student of progressive political theory who enjoyed deep connections to major figures on the Latin American left, and his emotive memoir takes an unusually profound dive into the revolutionary movements of the late twentieth century, their lofty aspirations, euphoric victories, costly illusions, and tragic confrontations. Despite political and romantic setbacks, and injuries he endured in a swimming accident in 1989 that confined him to a wheelchair for the rest of his life, Burbach persisted in his uncompromising commitment to radical research and activist engagement."

Yet the collection of admirable studies presented by Domínguez and his esteemed Cuban collaborators manages to convey a compelling, if depressing, portrait of Cuban society. Universal health and education have produced worthy outcomes, but their quality is visibly deteriorating, and efforts at reform have fallen short. Although good data are scarce, it is clear that socioeconomic inequalities are widening along gender, ethnic, and geographic lines. Cuba’s highly centralized bureaucracy and tightly planned economy, both of which rest on ideological foundations resistant to reform, have repeatedly frustrated attempts to decentralize decision-making and increase democratic participation. Even these erudite authors struggle to recognize that renewed economic growth and higher labor productivity will require sacrificing some egalitarian social ideals."

Lochery has written a useful introduction to an underappreciated corner of Europe, tracing the country’s history from the fall of authoritarian rule in the so-called Carnation Revolution of 1974 to the present. Most of his story covers the early years. It recounts how Portugal established democracy, a tale that involves U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger’s curious intervention in Portuguese domestic politics to bolster moderates against Communists. Lochery also narrates Portugal’s joining the EU in 1986 and the 2004 elevation of a Portuguese politician, José Manuel Barroso, to head the European Commission. Short chapters on recent years focus on the political fallout of the financial crisis, which posed as dire a threat to Portuguese democracy as communism had a quarter century earlier."
31,After Europe,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2017-10-16/after-europe,After Europe,"The multiple crises washing over Europe—Brexit, the rise of right-wing populism, mass migration, the resurgence of Russia, simmering financial crises, the uncertainty introduced by the Trump administration—have produced overblown, opportunistic warnings about “the end of Europe.” But some Europessimists sincerely believe that Europe’s travails reflect an epochal transformation in Western societies. So argues Krastev, an uncommonly literate, reflective, and engaging observer of European affairs who is also a trained philosopher with a penchant for grand historical visions. He argues that in the wake of Franco-German reconciliation, the collapse of the Soviet Union, and the stagnation of the European economic model, the movement for further European integration lacks big ideas to push it forward. Moreover, Krastev believes that the refugee crisis poses a genuine threat to European identity by spawning populism, which in turn threatens Europe’s established political compromises, cultural cosmopolitanism, commitment to human rights, and social solidarity. Still, a realistic analysis of these crises might suggest a more sanguine conclusion. Consider that in the past two years, European governments have worked together to cut third-country immigration by more than 80 percent. The United Kingdom has manifestly failed to outline a workable plan for leaving the EU. And although economic malaise may be the most serious of all the crises, the eurozone seems to be stable and recovering for the moment. Even without great ideas or popular optimism, Europe muddles through."
32,Realizing Roma Rights,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2017-10-16/realizing-roma-rights,Realizing Roma Rights,"The estimated 14 million Roma people—“gypsies,” in old-fashioned parlance—compose Europe’s hidden minority. This book introduces readers to their plight, focusing especially on legal remedies for human rights violations. Like African Americans, the Roma suffer from a legacy of slavery, discrimination, and economic marginalization. Yet over the past century, the Roma have not benefited from the type of broad legal revolution that has improved the lot of minorities in the United States. Governments, especially in eastern Europe, continue to slight the Roma, often informally, in the provision of housing, education, and employment and frequently fail to protect them from violence and violations of family rights, including the unjustified forcible removal of children. Although a significant literature on Roma rights exists in Europe, this book seeks to bring the Roma’s plight to the attention of Americans. Insofar as policies toward the Roma have improved, it is largely because western European countries use the EU to impose policy changes on eastern European governments. The authors blame the Roma’s continued second-class status in Europe on a weak social and governmental commitment to the cause of equality, but they also note that the Roma have failed to organize effectively."

Many commentators on both the left and the right insist that powerful officials in international organizations such as the International Monetary Fund and the EU dominate global finance. Yet such institutions rarely act independently. Instead, just like domestic political institutions, they are arenas of political conflict. Henning analyzes the European financial crisis of the last decade, focusing on seven debt-restructuring programs that pitted creditors against debtor nations. He explores why oversight of such programs lies with the so-called troika formed by the European Central Bank, the European Commission, and the IMF—a cumbersome arrangement that increases complexity, reduces efficiency, and undermines European integration. The reason, Henning argues, is that parliaments in powerful creditor countries, notably Germany, will only approve institutional arrangements designed to do their bidding to the greatest extent possible. Ironically, given the widespread belief that the EU suffers from a “democratic deficit,” creditors rejected an EU-based solution—a proposed European Monetary Fund—because it would have diluted their power and restricted the imposed austerity that benefits them."
34,Stanton: Lincoln’s War Secretary,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2017-10-16/stanton-lincolns-war-secretary,Stanton: Lincoln’s War Secretary,"With cities and college campuses around the United States engaged in bitter debates over the fate of memorials to the Confederacy and its leaders, Stahr’s timely biography of Edwin Stanton, who served as President Abraham Lincoln’s secretary of war, brings an important reminder of just how wrenching and transformational the Civil War was. Stanton was responsible for the recruitment, supply, and coordination of the unprecedented military machine that the Union assembled during the war, and also played a critical role in the suppression of Confederate sympathizers and antidraft activists in the North, which led to thousands of arrests and trials by military commission. A longtime Democrat, Stanton would go on to forge close links with the Radical Republican faction, and in the shocking days following Lincoln’s assassination and the attempted assassination of Secretary of State William Seward, Stanton was the virtual ruler of the United States. In 1868, President Andrew Johnson demanded Stanton’s resignation after Stanton sided with Republicans who wanted to take a harder line on Reconstruction in the South. That dispute led to Johnson’s impeachment and trial. Few Americans have been at the center of so many consequential political storms; this long and thorough (at times a bit too thorough) account sheds new light on some of the most important events in the history of the United States."

Both of her parents were elected as Democrats to the city’s Board of Aldermen and plied their trade in much the same way that past generations of ward politicians had done: doing favors, finding jobs for constituents, keeping their fingers on the pulse of the local community. Out of that experience DeLauro developed a concern for the underdog and a commitment to retail politics. In The Least Among Us, which combines backward-looking memoir with forward-facing prescriptions, DeLauro argues that, with inequality growing and newly arrived immigrants struggling in U.S. cities, old-school Democratic politics has much to offer. Should the Democrats recapture the House of Representatives in 2018, DeLauro’s mix of sharp intelligence, skilled partisan instincts, and long-term legislative experience will make her a key player. Readers who want to know how the winds might shift in Washington could do worse than to learn how DeLauro understands politics."

E. Lawrence, helping to transform the British archaeologist and military officer into “Lawrence of Arabia” in the public imagination during World War I. Thomas remained a dominant presence in the U.S. media well into the 1970s, but he might be the most famous twentieth-century media figure whom hardly anyone under 40 has heard of. Stephens has written an unusual biography; he is less interested in rescuing Thomas from oblivion than in illuminating what his rise and fall say about a changing country. Thomas was more of a showman than a reporter; he embellished Lawrence’s story with so many legends and half-truths that biographers and researchers are still trying to untangle the mess. He nimbly adapted to the shifting conditions in the media industry, moving from radio to newsreels and finally to television. Stephens suggests that today’s media environment is less hospitable to the kind of journalism Thomas practiced. The mass audiences of the networks have broken up, and Thomas’ trademark travelogues would have less appeal in the age of jet travel. All true, but if Thomas were a young man today, he might just find another road to fame and glory."

Bannon, who prior to the campaign had been largely unknown beyond the audience of his controversial “alt-right” website, Breitbart News, helped Trump skewer the bipartisan political establishment and activate enough angry voters in the right places to eke out an Electoral College victory despite losing the popular vote. Green saw Bannon as an important figure early on and began to track his career long before other journalists. As a result, Green had the material and access to produce a deeply researched and sharply observed account of a political figure and a movement that took most of the country by surprise. Many seasoned observers thought that Trump had rendered himself unelectable by embracing and peddling “birther” conspiracy theories regarding President Barack Obama’s national origins. Bannon, however, understood that Trump had forged a bond with a significant Republican constituency that could win him the GOP nomination and put him on the road to the White House. Although Bannon’s tenure as Trump’s chief strategist in the White House was brief and mostly unsuccessful, it is unlikely that his influence in U.S. politics will fade quietly away. Readers will find no better guide to Bannon’s vision than this gripping and sometimes appalling account."
38,On Tactics: A Theory of Victory in Battle,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2017-10-16/tactics-theory-victory-battle,On Tactics: A Theory of Victory in Battle,"Given the steady flood of books about strategy, it is remarkable how few there are about tactics. Friedman has filled that gap with a short, sharp piece of analysis that highlights the physical, mental, and moral dimensions of conflict and explores important concepts such as “the culminating point of victory,” the term Clausewitz used to describe the point when the attacker had achieved the maximum possible. The successful tactician, Friedman writes, “arranges the physical means at his disposal in terms of maneuver, mass, firepower, and tempo to inflict mental effects in the mind of the opposing tactician and his units: deception, surprise, confusion, and shock.” Friedman enlivens a potentially dull subject, using plenty of historical examples to illustrate his points. In so doing, he demonstrates that some core lessons are timeless—the advantage of combined arms, the importance of having the right mix of mass and firepower—even though their application must incorporate the latest technologies. Although he shows how war fighters can win tactical victories, he is well aware that in the broader strategic context, these may not be sufficient to win a war."

Almost every online transaction, however routine and innocent, has the potential to become part of an unseen maneuver to cause mischief, steal money, bring down vital infrastructure, or subvert a government. But it is difficult to take the measure of cyberconflict, because it is now part of every other form of conflict; it affects everything while deciding very little on its own, at least thus far. One merit of Klimburg’s book is his description of the many layers of the Internet, their vulnerabilities, and the governance problems they pose, although the book’s profusion of acronyms can be overwhelming. The essential portrait of cyberspace that emerges is of a stateless global good being ruthlessly exploited by states, especially for the purpose of reshaping the way people think; some of the strongest sections focus on Russia, an innovator in such activity."
40,Turning to Political Violence: The Emergence of Terrorism,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2017-10-16/turning-political-violence-emergence-terrorism,Turning to Political Violence: The Emergence of Terrorism,"Sageman sets out to explain why people with radical political agendas turn to violence. He covers the French Revolution, the development of terrorism in tsarist Russia, the radical nationalist movements in the Balkans that helped trigger World War I, and anarchist violence in the United States during the early twentieth century. The book’s greatest value lies in its detailed accounts of the individuals who plotted attentats (Sageman favors this French word over “attacks” because it better conveys a sense of aggression). Although the book touches on mob violence and indiscriminate killing, Sageman mostly examines efforts to assassinate significant political figures. His sharp focus on the perpetrators of such acts illuminates their motives and circumstances but does not contribute much to Sageman’s main goal of developing a general theory of why some people become killers. One thing that comes through quite clearly, however, is the role of political repression in radicalizing those who might otherwise have eschewed violence."

The authors reveal the complex set of relations among bin Laden’s many wives and children, the disagreements within al Qaeda (most of its senior figures opposed the 9/11 plan), and the challenge posed to the organization by the brutal sectarianism of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the leader of its affiliate in Iraq. The books sheds considerable (although not conclusive) light on the question of whether senior Pakistani officials knew that bin Laden was hiding in their country. Perhaps the book’s most fascinating sections explain how a large group of senior al Qaeda figures and bin Laden family members found unlikely refuge in Iran after the 9/11 attacks. They were both guests and hostages, providing Iran with some immunity from al Qaeda attacks and representing potential bargaining chips—ultimately never cashed in—during negotiations with the United States."

As aesthetically pleasing and occasionally useful as such theoretical constructs may be, human life does not conform to them. In particular, they fail to account for the crises that all too frequently plague modern economies. Bookstaber’s cogent and accessible book explains the financial crisis of 2008 in great detail, demonstrating how people’s reactions to events—sometimes emotional, sometimes rational—influenced the behavior of other people, which then reverberated back to the initial actors. This is what the philanthropist and investor George Soros has called “reflexivity.” To better understand such dynamics, Bookstaber endorses a pragmatic, inductive “storytelling” approach and recommends that analysts eschew deductive, theoretical approaches."
43,The Language of Global Success: How a Common Tongue Transforms Multinational Organizations,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2017-10-16/language-global-success-how-common-tongue-transforms,The Language of Global Success: How a Common Tongue Transforms Multinational Organizations,"In 2010, the chief executive of a rapidly growing Japanese e-commerce firm, Rakuten, mandated that all of the company’s 10,000 employees, most of whom were Japanese, start using English to communicate within the firm, both in speech and in writing. Neeley followed the implementation of this radical change over the course of five years. She weaves her observations of Rakuten into a larger story about language education in Japan, which is a crucial part of the “Abenomics” agenda of the country’s prime minister, Shinzo Abe. The result is an interesting and informative book full of practical lessons for any internationally ambitious organization. Ninety percent of Rakuten’s employees obtained the targeted level of English proficiency within two years, and those who did not but nevertheless showed promise were granted another six months to reach the goal. Neeley points out that although language reflects culture and influences behavior, it does not determine them. Indeed, she reports that one consequence of the universal use of English at Rakuten was the reinforcement of traditional Japanese customs throughout the firm, especially Japanese-style hospitality, thanks to clearer shared expectations."
44,Basic Income,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2017-10-16/basic-income,Basic Income,"Is the world—or at least some countries—ready for a basic income? These two books argue strongly in the affirmative. Such a policy involves the government providing cash grants to every member of society at a level that could sustain life: an amount equal to one-quarter of GDP per capita would suffice, suggest Van Parijs and Vanderborght. The size of the grants could be affected by various factors, such as the recipient’s age and level of need, and could be conditioned on grantees meeting certain behavioral requirements, such as preventing truancy in their school-age children. Van Parijs and Vanderborght, however, prefer a universal, unconditional cash grant—as does Standing. Van Parijs and Vanderborght’s book is more scholarly than Standing’s and explores the history of basic-income schemes going all the way back to sixteenth-century Antwerp. Standing, for his part, usefully examines present-day pilot projects in Finland, the Netherlands, and the Canadian province of Ontario."

Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson and as one of the main architects of U.S. (and, by extension, South Vietnamese) strategy in the Vietnam War. But as the death toll from the war mounted and public opposition increased, McNamara left (or was perhaps pushed out of) the Pentagon and took the helm at the World Bank, where he served until 1981. His famous drive and energy radically transformed the bank: reformulating its mission, increasing the scale of its operations, and turning it into the preeminent global institution for supporting economic development. This useful book describes McNamara’s tenure during a turbulent period that saw the partial breakdown of the postwar international monetary system, two major increases in world oil prices, and China’s entry into the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. Sharma analyzes the positive and negative aspects of McNamara’s enduring legacy at the bank, including his focus on reducing poverty and his insistence on rigorous quantitative analysis of both client countries and the bank’s own performance."

The authors quarrel with the conventional wisdom about what is necessary for successful development. Instead of hawking a one-size-fits-all formula, they urge countries to find a niche in the world economy by taking a pragmatic approach tailored to their financial resources, labor markets, and types of government. That said, Lin and Monga tend to favor the creation of industrial or export zones, outfitted with infrastructure and unburdened by red tape—but also offered no protection from market forces. They have no ideological objection to an active role for government, which is often necessary, but they are wary of restrictions and regulations that allow only some players to profit."

If an American president draws a “redline” but fails to enforce it with military power when an adversary crosses it, will this embolden other adversaries? The prevailing wisdom among policymakers and pundits is that credibility counts. No such consensus exists, however, among political scientists, many of whom argue that Washington’s credibility in the eyes of an adversary will be overwhelmingly shaped by the adversary’s reading of current U.S. interests and capabilities, and not by past actions. Harvey and Mitton join this debate with a detailed study of the Obama administration’s response to Syria’s use of chemical weapons in 2013. After Syria crossed U.S. President Barack Obama’s publicly stated redline by using such weapons against civilians and rebels, Russia brokered an agreement in which Syria gave up its chemical stockpiles but avoided U.S. military action. Harvey and Mitton argue that Washington’s “reputation for resolve”—earned by the use of U.S. military force in similar circumstances in Bosnia, Kosovo, and Iraq—influenced Russian and Syrian calculations. The authors do not settle the debate about whether Obama harmed that reputation by declining to use military force to punish Syria. But they drive home the fact that credibility ultimately depends on the imperfect perceptions of leaders and their real-time calculations of risks and probabilities."
48,Renegotiating the World Order: Institutional Change in International Politics,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/renegotiating-world-order-institutional-change-international-politics,Renegotiating the World Order: Institutional Change in International Politics,"How will rising states such at Brazil, China, and India seek to reshape the global order? Will they be responsible stakeholders working within the existing Western-led order, or will they be revisionists seeking to overturn it? After years of debate, most scholars have concluded that the most likely answer is not either-or: sometimes rising states will seek greater authority within existing institutions (for example, greater voting rights in the International Monetary Fund), and at other times they will venture out to create new ones (such as China’s Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank). Lipscy provides the most elegant and systematic explanation yet for these diverse and shifting choices. His key insight is that policy areas differ in their propensity to create competition between institutions. In some areas, such as the management of financial crises, all states want global surveillance of the situation, so it makes sense to concentrate capabilities in a single institution—and the costs for dissatisfied rising states of creating new institutions would be prohibitively high, anyway. But other policy areas, such as foreign aid and infrastructure lending, reward competition over cooperation, creating more opportunities for rising states to strike out on their own."

He is remembered at home for his paternalistic liberalism and complicity in racial injustice and abroad for his naive idealism. But this groundbreaking book by Throntveit, a young historian, tells a different and more sympathetic story; it is an extraordinary effort to recover and illuminate the thinking behind Wilson’s internationalist vision. Throntveit argues that Wilson was not actually a “Wilsonian,” if that term implies imposing American-style democracy on other countries. What Wilson actually sought was the gradual and collective development of a system of global governance geared toward the promotion of justice and peaceful change. It was a vision, Throntveit maintains, that was deeply influenced by the American wing of the philosophical school of pragmatism, particularly the ideas of William James. Wilson’s views were also shaped by the Anglo-American progressive tradition and its many public intellectuals, including Jane Addams, W. E. B. Du Bois, John Dewey, Herbert Croly, and Walter Lippmann. Wilson’s thinking was certainly eclectic, with ideas drawn from British constitutional theorists, the American founders, and Christian ethicists. But Throntveit makes a powerful case that Wilson developed a pragmatic and sensible internationalist vision—an accomplishment that should not be obscured by Wilson’s moral and political failings."

The UN’s 1948 adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was the starting point for what would become a revolution in global political culture. In this landmark book, Bradley illuminates this transformation, focusing less on the drama of great-power politics than on subtle shifts in how elites and activists outside of government visualized and verbalized the rights and obligations of people within an emerging postwar community of nations, tracking how talk of human rights went from an “exotic aspirational language” to an “everyday vernacular.” In a multitude of small steps, symbolic moments, breakthroughs, and setbacks during the postwar decades, ideas about human rights wove themselves into narratives about the United States’ identity and role in the world. Sensibilities in Africa, Asia, and Europe also changed dramatically. But Bradley’s arresting account of the rise of a global human rights imagination makes its most profound statements on the subject of the United States’ changing—and, unfortunately, declining—position within this evolving moral landscape."

He contends that although the effort to cut terrorists off from the global financial system has crimped business and hampered humanitarian aid, “there is no evidence that it has ever thwarted a terrorist campaign.” “Governments,” he concludes, “should overhaul their approach to countering terrorist funding, shifting their focus away from the financial sector.”"

In an effort to make these data-collection programs more transparent and legitimate, the Obama administration established a special review group, revived a dormant privacy oversight board, and issued an executive order pledging to respect the privacy rights of noncitizens abroad. U.S. technology and telecommunications companies—whose complicity Snowden’s documents had exposed—moved into a defensive crouch. In order to maintain their international customer base, they sought to explain away their past cooperation and distanced themselves from the government. In 2015, the U.S. Congress entered the fray, reining in the so-called telephony metadata program, the NSA’s bulk collection of the phone numbers of incoming and outgoing calls, which can be used to draw a map of a person’s associations."

Drawing on an unprecedented amount of historical economic data from 20 countries, Piketty showed that wealth concentration had returned to a peak not seen since the early twentieth century. Today in the United States, the top one percent of households earn around 20 percent of the nation’s income, a dramatic change from the middle of the twentieth century, when income was spread more evenly and the top one percent’s share hovered at around ten percent. Piketty predicted that without corrective action, the trend toward ever more concentrated income and wealth would continue, and so he called for a global tax on wealth."
54,Political Islam After the Arab Spring,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/review-essay/2017-10-16/political-islam-after-arab-spring,Political Islam After the Arab Spring,"The term “Islamism” and its watered-down equivalent, “political Islam,” sprang into widespread use after the Iranian Revolution of 1979 and soon became permanent fixtures of contemporary political discourse. They were coined to describe an allegedly new phenomenon: political movements headed by educated Muslim laymen who advocated the “re-Islamization” of Muslim-majority countries (and Muslim communities elsewhere) that had, in their eyes, ceased to be sufficiently Islamic. These movements promoted sharia through modern forms of popular mobilization—for example, creating branches specifically for young people, women, and workers. They adopted a hybrid organizational structure, a cross between a traditional Sufi brotherhood, in which members pass through different steps of initiation, and a modern political party, where an advisory council appoints a leader who oversees technical committees devoted to particular policy areas. Islamists worked on two tracks: fostering a social movement that would partner with community organizations and charities and establishing a political movement that would compete in elections while pushing its members into the state bureaucracy."
55,Why the British Chose Brexit,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/review-essay/2017-10-16/why-british-chose-brexit,Why the British Chose Brexit,"The United Kingdom’s vote last year to leave the European Union was a seismic event. The British people ignored the advice of the leaders of all their major political parties and of virtually all experts. George Osborne, the chancellor of the exchequer, told voters that leaving would wreck the British economy. U.S. President Barack Obama warned that it would reduce the United Kingdom’s influence on the world stage. Financial markets, many pollsters, and political pundits all anticipated that voters would heed the elites’ advice. And yet they decided not to, setting off a process destined to transform the country’s politics, economy, and society."
56,Why Military Assistance Programs Disappoint,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/united-states/why-military-assistance-programs-disappoint,Why Military Assistance Programs Disappoint,"Since the end of World War II, U.S. administrations of both parties have relied on a time-honored foreign policy tool: training and equipping foreign militaries. Seeking to stabilize fragile states, the United States has adopted this approach in nearly every region of the world over the last 70 years. Today, Washington is working with the militaries of more than 100 countries and running large programs to train and equip armed forces in such hot spots as Afghanistan, Iraq, Jordan, and Pakistan."
57,Even Smarter Sanctions,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/united-states/even-smarter-sanctions,Even Smarter Sanctions,"Economic sanctions have been a fixture of U.S. foreign policy for decades, but never have they enjoyed so much popularity as they do today. On virtually every major foreign problem—North Korea’s belligerence, Iran’s nuclear aspirations, Russia’s aggression, the Islamic State’s (or ISIS’) brutality—the U.S. government has turned to some form of sanctions as an answer. Their value is one of the few things that former President Barack Obama and President Donald Trump agree on: Obama used them more than any other president in recent history, and Trump, in his first eight months in office, oversaw significant expansions of U.S. sanctions against North Korea, Venezuela, and, despite his misgivings, Russia."
58,Yemen’s Humanitarian Nightmare,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/yemen/2017-10-16/yemens-humanitarian-nightmare,Yemen’s Humanitarian Nightmare,"On February 20, 2015, as the residents of Sanaa prepared for evening prayers, Yemeni President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi put on a woman’s niqab and slipped out the back door of his official residence, where a car was waiting for him. For a month, Houthi rebels, who had taken Sanaa in late 2014, had been holding him under house arrest. By the time the guards noticed that he was gone, Hadi had reached the relative safety of the southern port of Aden. A month later, as Houthi forces advanced south, he fled again, this time to Riyadh, where he called on Saudi Arabia to intervene in Yemen’s civil war."
59,Will India Start Acting Like a Global Power?,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/india/2017-10-16/will-india-start-acting-global-power,Will India Start Acting Like a Global Power?,"The country with the world’s third-largest military by personnel strength, fifth-largest defense budget, and seventh-largest economy isn’t a member of the UN Security Council. It isn’t even a member of the G-7, the exclusive club of major industrialized economies. It is India, a country long regarded as an emerging power rather than a major global player."
60,Deterring Cyberattacks,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/review-essay/2017-10-16/deterring-cyberattacks,Deterring Cyberattacks,"In the two years before the 2016 U.S. presidential election, hackers targeted a number of prominent political organizations of both parties, including the Democratic National Committee (DNC), and managed to steal a trove of documents pertaining to the presidential campaign of Hillary Clinton. The hackers got ahold of private e-mails, including those belonging to Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the DNC chair, and John Podesta, Clinton’s campaign chair. Some of these exchanges discussed hot-button issues such as the Clinton Foundation’s fundraising or suggested that senior DNC figures had sought to aid Clinton in her primary campaign against Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont."
61,Responding to Russia’s Resurgence,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/russia-fsu/2017-10-16/responding-russias-resurgence,Responding to Russia’s Resurgence,"Many observers believe that the greatest damage Russia has done to U.S. interests in recent years stems from the Kremlin’s interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential race. Although there is no question that Moscow’s meddling in American elections is deeply worrying, it is just one aspect of the threat Russia poses. Under Vladimir Putin, Russia has embarked on a systematic challenge to the West. The goal is to weaken the bonds between Europe and the United States and among EU members, undermine NATO’s solidarity, and strengthen Russia’s strategic position in its immediate neighborhood and beyond. Putin wants nothing less than to return Russia to the center of global politics by challenging the primacy that the United States has enjoyed since the end of the Cold War. He has undertaken a major military modernization designed to intimidate neighbors and weaken NATO, and he has resorted to the overt use of military force to establish new facts on the ground—not just in what Moscow calls its “sphere of privileged interests,” which encompasses all of the former Soviet republics, but also further afield, including in the Middle East, an area where the U.S. military has long operated with a free hand."
62,Preventing the Next Attack,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/world/2017-10-16/preventing-next-attack,Preventing the Next Attack,"In the immediate aftermath of 9/11, the United States’ resolve was clear: never again. Never again would it let shadowy networks of jihadists, acting in the name of a perverted version of Islam, carry out a catastrophic attack on American soil. And so, in fits and starts, the George W. Bush administration and then the Obama administration developed a strategy for fighting what became known as “the global war on terror.” Washington sought to disrupt plots wherever they emerged and deny terrorists safe havens wherever they existed. When possible, it would rely on local partners to prosecute the fight. But when necessary, it would act alone to disrupt plots and kill or capture terrorist operatives and leaders, including with drone strikes and daring special operations raids such as the one that killed Osama bin Laden."
63,Keeping Out of Syria,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/syria/2017-10-16/keeping-out-syria,Keeping Out of Syria,"The Syrian civil war has entered a new phase. President Bashar al-Assad’s government has consolidated its grip on the western half of the country, and in the east, U.S.-backed forces are advancing on the remnants of the Islamic State (also known as ISIS). So far, these two campaigns have remained largely separate. But that is changing: Assad, with Iranian and Russian help, is starting to project more power into eastern Syria. As ISIS’ remaining territory shrinks, Syrian and U.S.-backed forces are converging on the same cities. Before long, Washington will have to decide whether, when, and how to withdraw."
64,Mission Still Not Accomplished in Iraq,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/middle-east/2017-10-16/mission-still-not-accomplished-iraq,Mission Still Not Accomplished in Iraq,"In July 2017, Iraqi soldiers, backed by U.S. air strikes, liberated Mosul, the city where Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of the Islamic State (also known as ISIS), had declared a caliphate just three years before. It was a hard-won victory. For nine grueling months, Iraq’s Counter Terrorism Service, an elite group of U.S.- trained forces, suffered heavy losses as they fought street by street to uproot ISIS fighters, who used the local population as human shields. Thousands of civilians were killed, and a million or so were displaced from their homes. Mosul’s historic monuments have been destroyed. And the city’s infrastructure lies in tatters."
65,Staying the Course in Afghanistan,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/asia/2017-10-16/staying-course-afghanistan,Staying the Course in Afghanistan,"The cigarette glowed red as he took a drag, and the smoke rose rapidly as he exhaled. It had been a long afternoon. It had been a long war."
66,When Stalin Faced Hitler,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/russia-fsu/when-stalin-faced-hitler,When Stalin Faced Hitler,"Through the first four decades of his life, Joseph Stalin achieved little. He was born in 1878 to a poor family in Gori, Georgia, then part of the Russian empire. His father was a cobbler; his mother, a cleaning lady and seamstress. Stalin’s childhood, illnesses and mishaps included, was largely normal for the time. He received good marks in school and, as a teenager, got his poems published in well-regarded Georgian periodicals. (“To this day his beautiful, sonorous lyrics echo in my ears,” one reader would later recall.) But he did not sit for his final-year exams at the Tiflis Seminary and failed to graduate. Instead of becoming a priest, he became an underground revolutionary fighting tsarist oppression, spending the next 20 years hiding, organizing, and serving time in prison and internal exile in Siberia."
67,The Korean Missile Crisis,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/north-korea/2017-09-10/korean-missile-crisis,The Korean Missile Crisis,"It is time for the U.S. government to admit that it has failed to prevent North Korea from acquiring nuclear weapons and intercontinental ballistic missiles that can reach the United States. North Korea no longer poses a nonproliferation problem; it poses a nuclear deterrence problem. The gravest danger now is that North Korea, South Korea, and the United States will stumble into a catastrophic war that none of them wants."

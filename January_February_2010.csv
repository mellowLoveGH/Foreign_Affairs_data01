1,The Long Road to Zero,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/united-states/long-road-zero,The Long Road to Zero,"Over the past three years, a remarkable bipartisan consensus has emerged in Washington regarding nuclear security. The new U.S. nuclear agenda includes renewing formal arms control agreements with Russia, revitalizing a strategic dialogue with China, pushing for ratification of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, repairing the damaged nuclear nonproliferation regime, and redoubling efforts to reduce and secure fissile material that may be used in weapons. During the 2008 presidential campaign, the veteran foreign policy experts Henry Kissinger, Sam Nunn, William Perry, and George Shultz successfully encouraged both major-party candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain, to embrace the idea of a world free of nuclear weapons. In the past year, President Obama has made this goal a priority for his administration, although he admits that it is not likely to occur in his lifetime."
2,Not So Dire Straits,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2010-01-01/not-so-dire-straits,Not So Dire Straits,"Since 2005, Taiwan and China have been moving into a closer economic and political embrace -- a process that accelerated with the election of the pro-détente politician Ma Ying-jeou as Taiwan's president in 2008. This strengthening of relations presents the United States with its greatest challenge in the Taiwan Strait since 1979, when Washington severed ties with Taipei and established diplomatic relations with Beijing."
3,Against the Grain,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/world/against-grain,Against the Grain,"In the late eighteenth century, the English political economist Thomas Malthus took a look at two sets of numbers and had an unnerving vision: with food supplies increasing arithmetically while the number of people grew geometrically, the world population would eventually run out of food. ""By that law of our nature which makes food necessary to the life of man,"" he wrote in 1798, ""the effects of these two unequal powers must be kept equal. This implies a strong and constantly operating check on population from the difficulty of subsistence. This difficulty must fall some where and must necessarily be severely felt by a large portion of mankind."""
4,A Few Dollars at a Time,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/africa/2010-01-01/few-dollars-time,A Few Dollars at a Time,"Starting in this quarter, hundreds of millions of people will have an unprecedented opportunity to help the world's most unfortunate inhabitants. When purchasing airline tickets through most major reservation Web sites or through a travel agent, consumers will be asked if they want to make a direct contribution to the fight against the world's three deadliest epidemics: HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis. Part of a movement called innovative financing, the project is a new kind of aid that could fundamentally change the relationship between the rich and the poor throughout the world, a few dollars at a time."
5,The New Energy Order,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/liechtenstein/2009-12-21/new-energy-order,The New Energy Order,"The last decade has seen an extraordinary shift in expectations for the world energy system. After a long era of excess capacity, since 2001, prices for oil and most energy commodities have risen sharply and become more volatile. Easy-to-tap local fuel supplies have run short, forcing major energy consumers to depend on longer and seemingly more fragile supply chains. Prices have yo-yoed over the last 18 months: first reaching all-time highs, then dropping by two-thirds, and after that rising back up to surprisingly high levels given the continuing weakness of the global economy. The troubles extend far beyond oil. Governments in regions such as Europe worry about insecure supplies of natural gas. India, among others, is poised to depend heavily on coal imports in the coming decades. For these reasons, governments in nearly all the large consuming nations are now besieged by doubts about their energy security like at no time since the oil crises of the 1970s. Meanwhile, the biggest energy suppliers are questioning whether demand is certain enough to justify the big investments needed to develop new capacity. Producers and consumers, each group unsure of the other, cannot agree on how best to finance and manage a more secure energy system."
6,Mind Over Martyr,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/saudi-arabia/2009-12-21/mind-over-martyr,Mind Over Martyr,"Is it possible to deradicalize terrorists and their potential recruits? Saudi Arabia, a pioneer in rehabilitation efforts, claims that it is. Since 2004, more than 4,000 militants have gone through Saudi Arabia's programs, and the graduates have been reintegrated into mainstream society much more successfully than ordinary criminals. Governments elsewhere in the Middle East and throughout Europe and Southeast Asia have launched similar programs for neo-Nazis, far-right militants, narcoterrorists, and Islamist terrorists, encouraging them to abandon their radical ideology or renounce their violent means or both."

Although some of the papers are dated, they remain useful. One section of the book includes several contributions about the nature of poverty in the region, with a particularly informative chapter on poverty in the African countryside. Another section questions the conventional wisdom that economic reforms in the 1980s and 1990s aggravated poverty, painting a more nuanced picture. Although poverty in the region worsened during this period, it does not appear to have increased more in countries that implemented reforms than in those that did not. Because the available economic data on Africa are mired by low quality and major gaps, however, the conclusions of several chapters are limited.

11,Legislative Power in Emerging African Democracies,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2009-12-20/legislative-power-emerging-african-democracies,Legislative Power in Emerging African Democracies,"Most observers would concur with Barkan's view that democracy cannot thrive without an effective and influential legislature to balance the power of the executive. Since most of the recent defects in governance in Africa can be blamed on unaccountable leaders, this view seems particularly germane to democracy there. Yet, oddly, the evolution and current state of legislatures in Africa have attracted little attention. This collection of case studies of the legislatures in Benin, Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, South Africa, and Uganda begins to rectify this oversight. Barkan's central empirical thesis is that all over Africa, a young, educated, and professional class of parliamentarians has begun to advance the power of legislatures, pressuring presidents to accept more democratization. As the case studies show, this has meant that legislatures have begun asserting their constitutional prerogatives -- notably, the oversight of government spending and activities. It also appears to have meant that legislators have voted themselves salary increases and other perks, and the experiences of Kenya and Nigeria, for instance, certainly suggest that legislators' commitment to democratic values is uneven at best. The book's real lesson is that the legislative branch can balance the power of the executive branch even when the former's members are not particularly virtuous.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."
12,The Dynamics of Violence in Central Africa,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2009-12-20/dynamics-violence-central-africa,The Dynamics of Violence in Central Africa,"A longtime observer of the Great Lakes region of Africa, Lemarchand has conducted an incisive study of the Hutu-Tutsi violence in Rwanda and Burundi and the conflict it helped propagate in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the mid-1990s. He emphasizes the evolution of the region's ethnic conflicts over long periods of time, revealing a dynamic in which episodes of violence force certain groups to migrate, which then puts them in conflict with other groups. That, in turn, eventually creates another cycle of violence and forced migration. Quite convincingly, Lemarchand argues that the Tutsi army's now-forgotten slaughter of Hutu civilians in Burundi in 1972, which resulted in between 150,000 and 300,000 casualties, was a watershed event that forever shaped Hutu-Tutsi relations. His analysis of the civil wars in the Democratic Republic of the Congo since 1996 skillfully untangles the web of shifting ethnic alliances and explains how the very real grievances of desperately poor communities are exploited by rapacious patrimonial warlords and their militias.

13,The Dragon’s Gift: The Real Story of China in Africa,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2009-12-20/dragons-gift-real-story-china-africa,The Dragon’s Gift: The Real Story of China in Africa,"Brautigam situates the current relationship between China and Africa within a historical framework that goes back to the 1960s. Bucking the conventional wisdom that China's substantial increases in aid to the region are motivated by short-term commercial and strategic interests, Brautigam's lively and thoroughly documented account emphasizes that Chinese motivations are broader and more long term. The book starts with a revealing history of Chinese involvement in the region, beginning with agricultural and infrastructure projects in the 1960s. It outlines China's current aid activities and investments in the region, providing the most authoritative data available on both. The book's most intriguing argument is that China is genuinely interested in extending to Africa the lessons it learned from its own development and that what may appear to be crass commercial moves are actually the result of careful thinking about mutually beneficial activities. Brautigam is clearly impressed with what she views as the breadth and sophistication of China's Africa policy and contrasts it with the self-serving and nearsighted thinking of the West's.

John Githongo became permanent secretary for governance and ethics after the democratically elected president Mwai Kibaki took office in 2002 promising great change. Naive, but persistent and principled, Githongo soon uncovered massive corruption at the apex of the state, within a Kikuyu ethnic mafia around the presidency whose members believed that, after years out of power, it was time for their ethnic group to benefit. A fellow Kikuyu, Githongo had been expected to play along, and when he went public with detailed evidence, he was fired, discredited, and threatened. (He fled the country in 2005.) In the process of telling this story, Wrong covers a wide swath of contemporary Kenya with great precision and telling details, from the dynamics of ethnicity to the grinding poverty of the Nairobi slums and the cushy lifestyle of the country's establishment. The book trenchantly analyzes the complacency of Western donors and accuses the World Bank of actual complicity in Kenya's corruption. Amazingly, successive country representatives from the bank rented a house from and shared a garden with Kibaki in Nairobi, which was maintained at taxpayers' expense. For his troubles, Githongo was briefly feted in various feel-good international forums, but the Kibaki regime was barely admonished, and aid continued to flow into the country.

15,China and the Transformation of Global Capitalism,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2009-12-20/china-and-transformation-global-capitalism,China and the Transformation of Global Capitalism,"This symposium uses the Marxist-inflected theory of globalization known as world-systems theory to view some familiar topics through a fresh lens, although it is often blurred by jargon. Subjects addressed include how China's engagement with global capitalism has contributed to the rise of far-flung production networks, the shift of manufacturing to the East, the growing Asian resource hunger, and new geopolitical rivalries. Richard Appelbaum argues that the market power of mega-retailers, such as Wal-Mart, is counterbalanced by less well-known but similarly gigantic suppliers owned by enterprises from Hong Kong, Taiwan, and South Korea that command integrated production facilities. Stephanie Luce and Edna Bonacich explore nascent opportunities for the U.S. labor movement to cooperate with Chinese workers instead of treating them exclusively as competitors. And Beverly Silver and Lu Zhang suggest, with more hope than evidence, that labor unrest in China might invigorate the labor movement worldwide.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

The kingly past bequeathed a zero-sum concept of power; the colonial era, irrational borders and a toxically unequal distribution of wealth among ethnic groups; and postindependence military rule, a decline in state capacity and a turn to predation. The international environment is also damaging: as former Prime Minister U Nu said, the country is ""hemmed in,"" between China, India, and the distant but looming United States, ""like a tender gourd among the cactus."" This has caused successive leaders to close off Myanmar from the West and lean toward China. As in other predatory states, an advantaged military caste, in this case comprising four percent of the population, lives off everyone else. Many want to join, but few are chosen; once admitted, the price of survival is loyalty. The layering of ethnic, economic, and legitimacy crises has trapped the country in a tragedy with no near-term resolution, to which the U.S. policy of unremitting sanctions has contributed nothing productive.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."
17,"Honorable Survivor: Mao’s China, McCarthy’s America, and the Persecution of John S. Service",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2009-12-20/honorable-survivor-maos-china-mccarthys-america-and-persecution,"Honorable Survivor: Mao’s China, McCarthy’s America, and the Persecution of John S. Service","John Service was one of several China hands fired from the U.S. State Department for questionable loyalty in the early 1950s. His trouble started when he got entangled in the inquiry  into the leaking of classified documents by federal employees to the academic journal  Amerasia, a spy case that turned out to be more about FBI misconduct than Soviet espionage. He was not indicted, but the investigation led to his interrogation before a series of State Department and congressional committees and to his firing. The deeper cause of his downfall was that he had challenged more powerful officials by arguing that Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang was too corrupt to survive -- and he turned out to be right. (Less correct was his view that Mao's Communists were potentially pro-American pragmatists.) Service was eventually vindicated by the Supreme Court, but his diplomatic career had been ruined. Joiner traces the story in engrossing political and personal detail, based on interviews with Service and his wife and files from the State Department and the FBI obtained through the Freedom of Information Act. It is a cautionary tale about the harm of persecuting diplomats who tell the truth as they see it, but also, as Joiner acknowledges, about the dangers of a security culture so lax that extensive leaking had become habitual even for honorable officers."
18,The Art of Not Being Governed: An Anarchist History of Upland Southeast Asia,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2009-12-20/art-not-being-governed-anarchist-history-upland-southeast-asia,The Art of Not Being Governed: An Anarchist History of Upland Southeast Asia,"Scott has put rural and marginal people at the center of his previous studies, and here he offers a history of the estimated 100 million people who live in a vast hill and mountain zone that runs across southwest China, northeast India, and parts of five Southeast Asian countries. These populations fled into the hills over the course of two millennia, he argues, to avoid the imposition of slavery, indentured labor, and taxes by expanding states. There they evolved languages, economies, and ways of life designed to keep the state at bay. Outside of Asia, too, such fugitive populations define the ""ungovernable"" territories and ""minority"" or ""tribal"" identities usually thought of as exceptions to the norm. Scott often returns to the complex example of Myanmar (also called Burma) to explain how states mapped terrain, classified populations, and acquired resources as they expanded -- and to show how the Kachins, the Hmong, and others resisted. He believes that the uplanders' strategies of avoidance are approaching an endgame as new technologies give the modern state a longer reach. But the news from Afghanistan and Pakistan, as well as from Myanmar, suggests that these ungoverned groups may hold out longer than Scott thinks.

No wonder New Delhi aspires to great-power status -- and has begun to earn it with economic growth, a naval buildup, and smarter diplomacy. Sikri, a retired Indian diplomat, expresses the Indian perspective straightforwardly. The major obstacles to India's ambitions, he says, are an unjust suspicion of its motives on the part of its immediate neighbors and the rise of China. Blaming Afghanistan's ungovernability on Pakistan, he recommends pressuring Islamabad by announcing construction projects that would cut the flow of desperately needed water from the Indus River. He counsels cooperation with Beijing even while suggesting how India might weaken its acknowledgment of Chinese sovereignty in Tibet, where the Chinese presence constitutes a permanent threat to Indian security. India's ambitions in every theater encounter other actors already present. In this sense, Sikri is right to say that India is not a status quo power, even though its goal is to join, not overturn, the great-power system."
20,Japan’s Remilitarisation,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2009-12-20/japans-remilitarisation,Japan’s Remilitarisation,"For 40 years, Japan has incrementally raised its defense budget, extended its security perimeter, improved its armaments, and raised the bureaucratic status and operational ambit of the Self-Defense Forces. Do these trends, which accelerated after 2001, represent remilitarization or just the maintenance of a defensive posture in a more challenging security environment? Hughes argues for the former interpretation, based not just on data about budgets and weapons but also on contextual factors, such as the erosion of civilian control over the military, the strengthening of the military-industrial complex, the Liberal Democratic Party's promotion of constitutional changes, and Japan's acceptance of new tasks within the U.S.-Japanese defense alliance. Such trends validate the wariness of Japan's neighbors, such as China. But as Hughes acknowledges, Japan is nowhere near having the capacity to go to war without support from the United States. With Japan's government now under a new ruling party, this book provides a useful baseline from which to measure the future evolution of Japanese defense policy.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."
21,Political Liberalization in the Persian Gulf,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2009-12-19/political-liberalization-persian-gulf,Political Liberalization in the Persian Gulf,"This multiauthored survey of all the Persian Gulf states begins with a regionwide appraisal, followed by short country studies. The separate chapters treating those oil-rich and small Persian Gulf monarchies whose citizens are a minority of those living in each country -- Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates -- show the considerable liberalization and institution building that is taking place, but without disrupting the ruling families' holds on power. The portrayal of the United Arab Emirates as more like a corporation than a state is suggestive for the others as well. Of the chapters on the three big Persian Gulf states, two focus narrowly on the role of the ulama (Islamic clergy). The chapter on Saudi Arabia paints a bleak appraisal of the Wahhabi ulama, whereas the one on Iran sees much more ideological nuance, concluding that ""democracy has a better chance in Iran"" than in Sunni countries. The chapter on Iraq, after setting out the differing ""visions"" of democracy there, concludes that Iraq is no longer a nation-state but a ""diffuse"" country whose contending entities ""have yet to take their final shape."""
22,Jewish Terrorism in Israel,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2009-12-19/jewish-terrorism-israel,Jewish Terrorism in Israel,"Jewish Terrorism in Israel, the second book to appear in the Columbia Studies in Terrorism and Irregular Warfare series, sets a high bar for subsequent works. After a brisk treatment  of terrorism in ancient Israel (which often inspires today's terrorism), it moves to modern times, documenting not just the well-remembered examples, such as the 1948 assassination of Count Folke Bernadotte, Baruch Goldstein's 1994 mass murder in Hebron, and the 1995 assassination of Yitzhak Rabin but seemingly every terrorist act by Israeli Jews realized or aborted from 1948 to 2007. Avoiding the pitfalls that generally confront the study of terrorism -- either expressing outrage at such inhumane behavior or dismissing one man's terrorist as another man's freedom fighter -- the authors dispassionately study the backgrounds, social networks, and motives of the terrorists. Several of these case studies are based on interviews with perpetrators quaintly labeled as ""retired."" Comparing Jewish terrorism to that of Islamists, the authors show that ""religious terrorism is not a one-faith phenomenon."""
23,Negotiating With Iran: Wrestling the Ghosts of History,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2009-12-19/negotiating-iran-wrestling-ghosts-history,Negotiating With Iran: Wrestling the Ghosts of History,"Using four crises spread over four decades, from just after World War II to the 1980s, Limbert appraises the negotiating style of Iran and of those it confronts. The 1945-47 Azerbaijan crisis pitted Iran against the Soviet Union, with the United States playing a limited role. The 1951-53 oil nationalization crisis and the overthrow of Iranian Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddeq marked the moment the United States replaced the United Kingdom as the dominant Western power in Iran. The last two crises -- the 1979-81 Iranian hostage crisis and the U.S. effort throughout the 1980s to free Americans held hostage in Lebanon -- were bilateral confrontations between Washington and Tehran. Drawing on these four cases and more, Limbert offers advice on negotiating with Iran and addresses the need to overcome ""mutual myth-perceptions"" in U.S.-Iranian relations. Now serving as a senior official on Iran in the State Department, Limbert was one of those held hostage in Tehran from 1979 to 1981. Yet as this splendid study of U.S.-Iranian relations demonstrates, he emerged from that bitter experience with an ability to bring to his appraisal a rare combination of insight, dispassion, and empathy.

That many of the articles are book reviews gives the book the bonus of also offering a historiographical survey. Shlaim, a pioneer of the revisionist school of ""new historians"" that emerged in the 1980s, provides a realpolitik reading of the history, demolishing the heroic and innocent image of Israel in its relations with the Palestinians. In his accounting, up to the June 1967 war, Israel acted much like other struggling new nations -- no better, no worse. After 1967, Israel became a colonialist power occupying others and steadily taking over their lands. The Israeli side of the story (viewed critically) is dominant in most of the articles, but"

Alas, Subotic argues, the progress made in moving from an-eye-for-an-eye politics to due process in international and national courts and truth commissions is deceptive. It turns out, as her Serbian, Croatian, and Bosnian cases show, that local political actors, rather than dealing with history, have used the exercise for their own more immediate ends: to dispose of political opponents, secure economic assistance, or grease the way into the European Union. How this has happened and what those committed to making the new norms stick should do about it drive this book. Subotic goes about her study in an exceedingly clearheaded fashion; not only is she in full command of the relevant theoretical literature, but she deploys and then extends it in compact, crystal-clear paragraphs. The writing and argumentation are a model of what social science should be.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

Hence, this book's subtitle seems an overly large claim. Pomper justifies it in a dual sense: Ulyanov's political and intellectual milieu contained important antecedents of the movement to follow, and his life's twisted tragic-heroic turn heavily shaped Lenin's personal psychology. In March 1887, on a date timed to mark the successful assassination of Tsar Alexander II six years earlier, Ulyanov and 14 others plotted the same fate for Tsar Alexander III. They never got to throw their bombs at the target, and Ulyanov was hanged two months later. The psychological reading that Pomper renders -- that Lenin, in some significant degree, made the revolution to avenge what the tsarist regime had done to his brother and his family -- may not be entirely convincing in the absence of direct testimony from Lenin or those who knew him. But the canvas that Pomper so richly fills with the details of Ulyanov's precocious teenage intellectual interests and his path from a preoccupation with zoology to revolution and, ultimately, to terrorism makes for very engaging reading.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

At every turn, Bobelian argues, from the post-World War I peace to the failure of the U.S. Congress to pass genocide resolutions in the 1990s, the Armenian cause has fallen victim to broken Western promises and been sacrificed to the priorities of others. He carefully unwinds three entwined threads, starting with the hopes for an independent homeland that were dissolved when Armenia was absorbed into Soviet Russia. The second thread emerges from the 1920s onward, when Atatürk's Turkey made denial of the episode an element of the country's emergent nationalism. The third thread is the quest to have the events of 1915 recognized as genocide, efforts that have been thwarted by U.S. administrations concerned with protecting relations with a NATO ally.

From his days as a Pravda correspondent in Cairo in the mid-1960s through his time as Russian foreign minister and then prime minister in the 1990s -- a career stretching from Leonid Brezhnev to Vladimir Putin -- he has been personally involved in every major Middle Eastern event, from the wars of 1967 and 1973 to the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003, and in between the turmoil in Lebanon, Sudan, and Yemen. He has interviewed and negotiated with every major Middle Eastern leader, from Syria's Hafez al-Assad to Iraq's Saddam Hussein. Much of the book is, indeed, ""behind the scenes,"" as he lets the reader in on his conversations with Yassir Arafat (whom he admired), Golda Meir (he led secret negotiations with the Israelis from 1971 to 1977), Saddam, and many others. But he also inserts these accounts into thoughtful reflections on the sources of the Arab-Israeli conflict, Arab nationalism, the failure of communism in the Middle East, and the many missed opportunities to break the cycle of violence."

To a large degree, the same man emerges from both: in each account, he is a figure more of fascination than admiration -- quite in contrast to earlier biographies written by his devotees. He is a compelling crowd rouser but remote and cold personally, puritanical but more than a little lascivious, and the object of fervid political devotion yet ruthless in the pursuit of his compassionless notion of revolution. Service deals with Trotsky's life from boyhood to the end but concentrates on the critical period from his days as a youthful revolutionary and foe of Bolshevism through the 1920s and the dramatic arc from his ascendancy to his defeat. The writing is trim and unadorned, allowing Service to march expeditiously over new ground: Trotsky's early political affinity with Stalin, the smug self-confidence that worked against him in the post-1923 maneuvering, and his moments of striking political insight, which were matched by those of disastrous misjudgment."

Leading U.S. and Mexican political scientists, with National Science Foundation funding, ran a series of preelection polls whose results provide the fodder for each of the volume's 15 smartly argued essays. Unsurprisingly, the analysts concur that the winner ran a sharper campaign, successfully identifying himself with competence and prosperity while deploying negative advertising to tarnish the image of his opponent. With far-reaching implications, Alberto Diaz-Cayeros, Federico Estevez, and Beatriz Magaloni find that conditional cash transfers to very poor households (requiring that their children attend school) helped the incumbent party; paradoxically, the ""right-wing"" Calderón won as a result of antipoverty programs. The collection's authors dispute the degree to which ideological cleavages continue to divide Mexican voters, even as there is general agreement that the Mexican left faces difficult times ahead. Overall, these top experts paint a reasonably optimistic picture of a gradually maturing Mexican democracy.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

This welcome update on the current state of the feminist agenda in the region is full of strong contributions. Marcela Ríos Tobar skillfully describes the enduring contradictions of women's lives in the social democratic Chile of President Michelle Bachelet. Flávia Piovesan explains how Brazilian women leveraged the legitimacy of international institutions -- by successfully appealing to the Organization of American States -- to alter national laws and practices regarding violence within families. Well worth the price of admission is the brilliant concluding chapter, in which Jaquette champions professional women working within their democratic political systems -- to build bridges to government agencies, win legal redress through the courts, and provide life-sustaining social services. ""Feminists must be committed to the institutional means, as well as the utopian ends, of social justice,"" Jaquette soberly declares.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

But as the veteran Mexico watcher Grayson documents in lurid and depressing detail, powerful drug traffickers have corrupted the country's political and law enforcement establishments at all levels. The cartels simply have too much money, and the U.S. government, despite four decades of waging its ""war on drugs,"" has utterly failed to stem the cross-border drug flows and the distribution networks that continuously replenish criminal coffers. Grayson seems to approve of recent U.S. programs transferring equipment and technology to Mexican security forces, and he respects Mexican President Felipe Calderón's bold, forceful counterattacks against the criminal gangs. But Grayson's bottom line is pessimistic: ""It is extremely difficult -- probably impossible -- to eradicate the cartels. They or their offshoots will fight to hold on to an enterprise that yields Croesus-like fortunes."" More out of desperation than desire, Grayson proposes that the United States begin ""thinking about the unthinkable: decriminalization.""Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

To build a stout analytic framework for the next generation of market-oriented reforms that will secure and continue past progress, the Center for Global Development has pooled the talents of some of the hemisphere's leading social scientists in this cutting-edge synthesis of ""lessons learned."" The contributors seek a reasonable middle ground between simplistic one-size-fits-all prescriptions and a circumstance-specific ""it all depends"" approach, and between a paralyzing laundry list of proposals and a narrowly focused single-constraint diagnosis. The volume singles out five solid foundations for growth: sustained macroeconomic stability, a more equitable sharing of benefits, secure property rights, equal opportunities, and economic and political competition. Sophisticated country chapters explain what must be done to support political constituencies that favor market reform and encourage more rapid, sustainable growth.

In response, as Nelson painstakingly documents, government gunmen opened fire. Fearing further bloodshed, the military high command deposed President Hugo Chávez. But the improvised civilian government blundered while key generals vacillated -- allowing Chávez's more decisive military and civilian loyalists to quickly engineer his dramatic return. Nelson's minute-by-minute reporting vividly re-creates the infectious excitement of mass participation, and his well-sketched mini-portraits illuminate the deeper currents of Venezuela's polarized politics. Was the United States involved in the coup? On the contrary, concludes Nelson, the U.S. embassy was caught off-guard and was ineffective -- there was a ""complete lack of U.S. policy toward Venezuela."" Once the smoke cleared, the big winner was Chávez, who rewrote the history of the march as a skirmish between two equally matched groups of armed extremists. He seized the opportunity to purge opponents from the military and the metropolitan police and consolidate his grip over other national institutions.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

What is surprising is not that the ECJ handed down these decisions but that national courts -- and with them the nation-states of Europe -- assented to them, even though they were often seen as undermining national sovereignty. Alter is a hardheaded political scientist who recognizes the centrality of traditional factors such as economically self-interested litigants and politicians who support integration, yet she is also a keen legal analyst who acknowledges the ways in which lawyers and judges have forged a limited autonomy for the law.

Majone, among the most knowledgeable and insightful analysts of EU regulatory policy, remains unimpressed. The EU, he believes, has become a self-perpetuating Brussels-centered system of elitist governance that privileges further integration over sound policy and democratic representation. The evidence of inadequacy lies in referendum defeats, slower economic growth, tensions within the Eurozone, and the failure to further liberalize regulation. Majone's solution is to renounce the rhetoric of ""ever-closer union"" and encourage issue-specific ""coalitions of the willing"" among EU members -- which might even spark greater regulatory competition. Some will disagree with the diagnosis; others will counter that the EU has already, in practice, renounced ambitious plans in favor of a constitutional settlement akin to what Majone prescribes.

Depending on one's partisan predilection, Europe is held up as an example either of just and generous state intervention or of un-American socialism. In this provocative polemic, Baldwin, an economist, claims that the European social model does not exist. In most things, he says, the United States resembles, at least in statistical terms, an average European state. Yet a surprising amount of Baldwin's evidence actually supports the stereotype: the United States has a free-market system with little labor protection, an adversarial legal system, high murder rates and plenty of guns, an enormous prison population, inequitable and expensive health care, and widespread poverty. The book is a must-read nonetheless -- and not just because it is filled with intriguing facts that add nuance to what can often be a black-and-white debate. Baldwin is right to point out that although the distance between the European left and the American right is extreme, the difference between the average positions of Europe and the United States is less than is often believed. Yet he all but ignores that the U.S. government is far less equitable than its European counterparts. It is often surprisingly active in social matters, yet its policies benefit primarily the middle and upper classes.

39,Why the Dreyfus Affair Matters,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2009-12-19/why-dreyfus-affair-matters,Why the Dreyfus Affair Matters,"L'Affaire Dreyfus was the most widely debated European political event of the generation before World War I. Alfred Dreyfus, a French artillery captain and a Jew, was falsely accused of spying for Germany, for which he spent over four years in solitary confinement on the remote and tropical Devil's Island. To this end, top French military officers forged documents, suppressed information, perverted the military tribunal system, and abused their subordinates. They were backed by right-wing and clerical anti-Dreyfusards, who mobilized anti-Semitic riots, spread nationalist propaganda, marshaled conservative obstruction -- even planned a political assassination. Liberal and socialist Dreyfusards, sparked by Émile Zola's heroic polemic ""J'Accuse,"" supported the innocent man with an ultimately successful press campaign to pressure government officials and civilian courts to intervene. Begley, a lawyer, novelist, and historian, struggles to make it all relevant today. He dwells on anti-Semitism, which is less relevant to Western politics now than then. He invokes analogies to the Iraq war and the George W. Bush administration's policies on human rights, but in an oddly disconnected manner. All this misses the deeper point: the Dreyfus Affair cast the ""red-versus-blue"" mold of much modern politics, pitting conservative nationalists, soldiers, farmers, and religious interests in a partisan ideological battle against liberal journalists, academics, civilian professionals, urbanites, and cosmopolitans. In thousands of political battles -- including those over the Iraq war -- Western publics have relived the Dreyfus Affair ever since.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

By contrast, the United States is often dysfunctional. When indirect fees, private out-of-pocket costs, and taxes are all included, Americans pay as much as Europeans for public services but end up with much less. Europe's health care, social welfare, environmental policies, labor rights, ""smart power"" projection, and multiparty parliamentary governments are consistently more efficient, more just, and less fractious than the United States' libertarian, militaristic, two-party, money-driven, separation-of-powers alternatives. Hill can be breathlessly wordy, and, like some other Europhiles, he occasionally indulges in armchair social psychology -- but the overall argument rests on solid data. It explains why in most areas, it is Europe's constitutional forms, economic regulations, and social values, not those of the United States, that are the most popular models for new democracies.

Bush's foreign policy record were not problematic enough, dystopian caricatures of it usually add a raft of nefarious characters offscreen pulling the strings. In an earlier era, these would have been supervillains or arms manufacturers; today, they are often government contractors, such as Halliburton or Blackwater. Outsourcing has gone so mainstream, in other words, it even shows up in conspiracy theories. If the delegation of governmental functions to private companies has become standard practice, however, the scope,  implications, and wisdom of it remain unclear, which is why One Nation Under Contract is so useful. Stanger gathers together information on outsourcing in three different spheres -- security,  diplomacy, and development -- and in the process shows just how integral the phenomenon has become in establishing and maintaining the United States' global role in the twenty-first century. She  also shows just how little thought and oversight have accompanied the use of contractors, with predictably unfortunate consequences. The status quo is unacceptable, she argues, and turning back the clock is impossible, so the answer is more transparency and accountability. Officials need to better understand and manage public-private partnerships so that they can serve national interests rather than undermine them."

Gooch's biography breaks new ground, providing the most complete look at this mysterious and devastating writer available. It portrays O'Connor as an eccentric literary figure, well placed on the southern side of a flourishing postwar literary culture. Although the distinctive form of Catholicism that shaped O'Connor is well documented and influenced a host of other major American writers and thinkers as well, Gooch is curiously unwilling to bring this body of thought to bear on her life, her choices, or her work, instead focusing on the parts of her life that she herself considered the least important -- her travels, her involvement in the literary life of the day. Similarly, while treading gingerly through O'Connor's sometimes pungent and swampy racial attitudes, Gooch fails to give readers O'Connor as a southerner. They will be grateful for what they have but greedy for more; the definitive study of this great literary light has yet to be written.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

For historians, A Savage Conflict opens a new window onto the Civil War, portraying the anarchy and conflict that gradually enveloped the South and showing why, once the Confederates' major armies were defeated in the field, neither the Confederate government nor its supporters were willing to fight on as guerrillas. For students of contemporary politics, Sutherland's dispassionate but horrifying study of partisan warfare in the United States will illuminate many of the challenges faced by modern militaries and diplomats in Afghanistan, Iraq, and elsewhere. Sutherland's sober depiction of the moral and human costs of such conflicts, as well as his accounts of the terrifying rapidity with which civil peace disintegrated as anarchy spread, provides much food for thought."
44,Getting Out: Historical Perspectives on Leaving Iraq,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2009-12-19/getting-out-historical-perspectives-leaving-iraq,Getting Out: Historical Perspectives on Leaving Iraq,"A surprisingly large number of U.S. policymakers appear to agree with Henry Ford's famous observation that ""history is bunk."" Strong on theory and assumptions drawn from disciplines such as economics and political science, but largely ignorant of the facts on the ground, Americans repeatedly get into trouble when theory meets praxis and bullets start to fly. Getting Out is a healthy corrective to this national flaw. In this slender but illuminating volume, Walzer and Mills have assembled essays on past military withdrawals and on the tasks facing Americans designing an exit from Iraq. From Stanley Weintraub's crisp essay on Great Britain's withdrawal from the Colonies after its defeat in the American Revolutionary War to studies of much more recent disengagements, the contributions offer a variety of useful and stimulating perspectives on the complex problems involved in orderly withdrawals. George Packer's essay on Iraq best summarizes the consensus here: slow and careful withdrawals work best, although there are no guarantees."

In part, this is because the story is so inscrutable. Fragments of Islamic practice survived among slaves, but records are scarce and their meaning is hard to untangle. Many of the early Muslim immigrants to the United States either abandoned their religion or failed to pass it on to their offspring. And the earliest movements among African Americans to claim the title ""Muslim"" had little in common with recognized forms of Islam. All this changed in the 1960s, when Malcolm X helped lead a movement toward orthodox Islam among African Americans and new immigration laws opened the door to mass immigration from Muslim-majority countries. Unfortunately, Curtis' treatment even of this later era is scattered and unfocused. How many Muslims live in America? Where? What is the current relationship among Muslim immigrant groups -- and between African American Muslims and Muslim immigrants? Even though it dodges these questions, Muslims in America does provide an interesting and diverse sampling of Islamic theological reflection in the United States today.

Although the complexity of the subject matter sometimes defeats the author's best efforts to keep the big themes in view, Arsenal of Democracy highlights the intricate interplay between domestic politics and foreign policy during the last 60 years. It gives structural realists much to chew on; Zelizer makes a powerful case that domestic political debates, rather than the international environment, have frequently shaped U.S. foreign policy on issues of great strategic importance. He also discusses the proper balance between the executive and legislative branches, whether Republicans or Democrats have the ""security advantage,"" the proper size of the national security state, and the choice between unilateral and multilateral approaches to security. These are useful questions, and the book uses them to shape a powerful and rewarding study of U.S. foreign policy in modern times."

He is alive to the paradoxes of the topic: these are weapons that cause disease yet arise from efforts to discover cures, they are absolutely prohibited by an international treaty that nobody seems to think has removed the danger they pose, and they are presumed to be widely available but are rarely used. They are compared to nuclear weapons, but, as he notes, they do not work for deterrent purposes. They did not help Iraq, for example, in 1991. At the core of the book are detailed case studies of what is and was known about Iraqi, Soviet/Russian, and South African programs. The book draws lessons about intelligence, verification, and oversight, and also about what strategic value the offending countries sought to extract by pursuing such weapons. (Its analysis of the failure to get an accurate reading of the Iraqi position in 2002 is withering.) Through a careful examination of actual cases, Koblentz has done his best to get the true measure of the bioterrorist threat."

Now may be the era of diminishing marginal returns. One conclusion from English's thoughtful, informed meditation on the state of terrorism research is that there is not a lot new to say (and even here the field could have been spared another disquisition on the problems of terminology). It is not evident that the general lessons for counterterrorism that have come to the fore in dealing with Islamist terrorism are that different from those that emerged from dealing with Northern Ireland (on which English has written extensively). The basic need is to maintain a sense of perspective and understand that although particular campaigns come and go, political violence is a continuing possibility. English argues that governments must accept that the military has a limited role to play when dealing with the violence but that good intelligence will always be necessary."

With increasing longevity everywhere, often accompanied by low birthrates, the viability of public pension systems is a serious concern in all rich countries. This book compares the U.S. system to others (it fares rather well) and explores whether reforms in other countries are applicable to the United States. The authors conclude, partly on the basis of international experience, that the U.S. system can be made fiscally viable by gradually increasing the age of eligibility for retirement (including early retirement), by increasing payments into Social Security by the wealthy, and, as necessary, by increasing taxes. They also support a voluntary, government-sponsored, and privately managed retirement-savings program for low- and middle-income families -- as an addition to, not a substitute for, Social Security.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

They allow much room for charity, but they argue that charity should not be confused, as it frequently is, with economic development. The foreign aid establishment, both bilateral and multilateral, too often makes this error and, by operating through government bureaucracies, impedes the growth of a robust business sector in country after country. So do the activities of now-fashionable nongovernmental organizations, which provide free goods and services that could be provided by local businesses. The authors call for trimming back conventional aid and substituting it with a new Marshall Plan, mainly for Africa. The original Marshall Plan worked in the late 1940s by providing dollar loans to European businesses to help them get back on their feet; the repayment of the loans to governments kickstarted investments in infrastructure.

In this book, the Nobel Prize-winning Harvard economist and philosopher Sen departs from much of the recent philosophical discourse on this vast subject, usefully drawing not only on Western philosophy but also on the wisdom of ancient Asian thinkers. Sen rejects the social-contract approach to justice in favor of a results-based one that relies on an understanding of generally acknowledged injustices -- without attempting to design a perfectly just society, as the social-contract approach typically does. Also, he accepts that there may be different but equally legitimate views of what is just or unjust in particular cases. Instead of trying to adjudicate definitively among them, Sen encourages reasoned discourse about the different ethical principles involved. This discourse becomes an important element in moving toward a more just society.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

Keynes specified three important contentions. First, uncertainty needs to be taken seriously in modern economics, and this fundamental uncertainty -- the unknown unknowns -- cannot be adequately captured with the statistical techniques fashionable in the study of economics. Second, once dislodged from a satisfactory state, modern economies cannot be relied on to return smoothly and automatically to that state -- at least not quickly enough to be politically tolerable. Third, civilization cannot thrive if efficiency and moneymaking are held as its highest values.

This highly readable book focuses on the ideas that informed the actors who contributed to the debacle. It heavily implicates the profession of economics of recent decades, with its discovery and refinement of notions such as perfect financial markets (all available information is reflected in the current prices of financial assets) and rational expectations (all actors accurately know how the economy works and have unbiased forecasts of the future), along with its claim that all markets are stable and self-equilibrating. This ideology questioned the need for government regulation. And it resonated strongly with parts of the business and financial communities -- and with some legislators -- leading to the extensive deregulation of financial markets. Cassidy offers a clear and occasionally colorful exposition of the evolution of relevant economic thought in a way that is accessible to non-economists.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

None of the contributors believes that states have spun a web of laws and agreements that add up to a world government. Nonetheless, the legal scholars assembled here do see aspects of constitutionalism in global rules and institutions. David Kennedy explores the connections between law and the search for governance among states, Michael Doyle finds constitution-like aspects in the UN Charter, and other chapters probe the constitutional features in the World Trade Organization and the European Union. These treaty-based organizations, the authors argue, are more than just cooperative agreements among members; they are also perpetual institutions whose ongoing authority does not require continuing consent from member states. Skeptics will question the extent to which there is coherence and force in today's global rights and laws.

In Huntington's bold rendering, civilizations were primordial entities that would replace ideology and geopolitics as the animating sources of cooperation and conflict in the post-Cold War world. In this illuminating new collection of essays, Katzenstein and his colleagues hold that civilizations are not global conflict groups so much as malleable cultural identities that orient the ideas and practices of states and peoples. James Kurth argues that American civilization has transformed from its Protestant and British Enlightenment roots into a more fragmented, secular, and multicultural array of traditions and values. Susanne Rudolph explores the different facets of Hindu and Indian civilization, finding multiple identities and traditions ebbing and flowing in and out of South Asia. The most interesting arguments in the book deal with the ""inter-civilizational"" encounters -- diplomacy, commerce, cultural exchanges -- that are shaping global order. Huntington was deeply skeptical of anything that might be called a universal civilization, Western, liberal, or otherwise. In contrast, Katzenstein argues that civilizational ""clashes, encounters, and engagements"" are giving shape to a ""civilization of modernity"" that draws on values and aspirations of all the world's cultural groups, even if the precise content of this modern universalism remains unclear.

This is the world of empires, tributary systems, hegemonic orders, spheres of influence, and patron-client relations. In this pioneering work, Lake argues that hierarchical relations are best seen as bargained relationships in which the dominant state provides ""services"" -- such as order, security, and governance -- to subordinate states in return for compliance. What distinguishes the various forms of hierarchy, from colonialism to modern alliances, is the amount of sovereignty signed over to the leading state. Lake uses this insight to explore patterns of U.S.-led hierarchy in the security and economic realms, relying on measures such as the presence of U.S. military bases, exchange-rate linkages, and trade dependence. The danger in this sort of work is that it is easy to confuse willing subordination with coercion. Lake argues that because some states -- both small and large -- are subordinate to the United States and others are not, hierarchy is based on voluntary ""contracts,"" not just power. His theory does not illuminate hierarchies that are a mix of coercion and consent, but it offers new thinking about the complex interactions between the United States and its junior partners.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."
57,Mobilizing for Human Rights: International Law in Domestic Politics,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2009-12-19/mobilizing-human-rights-international-law-domestic-politics,Mobilizing for Human Rights: International Law in Domestic Politics,"Over the last half century, the body of international law that enshrined the sovereign independence of states has given way to new legal understandings that obligate governments to protect human rights. But does this emerging framework really constrain states? Simmons says yes, and proceeds to offer an extraordinarily rich and sophisticated argument about why, when, and how. Skeptics argue that governments sign agreements that obligate them to follow principles to which they already adhere or that they can easily ignore. Simmons agrees that governments pick and choose treaties, but over the long term, she sees human rights agreements changing the politics inside countries. They influence legislative agendas, alter political coalitions, and define the terms of acceptable state action. Simmons marshals impressive empirical data to test her argument and to distinguish it from alternative stories, examining the record in areas such as civil rights, the equality of women, and the humane treatment of prisoners. Her pathbreaking book explains much about the relationship between international law and national politics, but it also provides an inspiring glimpse of human progress in action.

58,The Perils of Global Legalism,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2009-12-19/perils-global-legalism,The Perils of Global Legalism,"This book is a spirited attack on ""excessive faith in the efficacy of international law."" Posner focuses on the thinking of American and European legal intellectuals who see international law as normatively good for the world regardless of whether it serves specific state interests. These ""global legalists,"" he claims, have ""long since dropped the conventional view that international law is based on the consent of states; international law transcends the interests of states and holds them in its grasp."" Posner sees global legalism as utopian -- built on unsustainable premises about human nature and the practicality of transferring domestic legal traditions to the international level. Several chapters take an interesting look at the proliferation of international courts and tribunals, arguing that these legal venues have performed better than other international bodies partly because they have limited jurisdictions that can be controlled by states. Posner may be right that international law matters when it serves nation-states' interests. But in a world of shared values and common problems, it should not be surprising that many states want to build global systems of laws and institutions that go beyond his minimalist vision."
59,The Best Defense?,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2010-01-01/best-defense,The Best Defense?,"After 9/11, U.S. President George W. Bush announced his determination to do whatever was necessary to prevent future terrorist attacks against the United States. Following the lead of several countries that had recently come to similar conclusions after their own bitter experiences -- including India, Israel, Japan, Russia, Spain, and the United Kingdom -- the United States tightened its immigration laws; increased the protection of its borders, ports, and infrastructure; criminalized providing ""material support"" for terrorist groups; and tore down the wall between the intelligence agencies and law enforcement agencies, which had crippled counterterrorist efforts for decades. Washington did not authorize preventive detention, as other countries had, but it used other measures to hold persons against whom criminal charges could not be brought -- thereby preventing terrorist attacks. The U.S. government also led or joined various international efforts aimed at warding off new dangers, such as the Proliferation Security Initiative, through which over 70 states cooperate to interdict the movement of nuclear materials across international borders."
60,The New Population Bomb,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2010-01-01/new-population-bomb,The New Population Bomb,"Forty-two years ago, the biologist Paul Ehrlich warned in The Population Bomb that mass starvation would strike in the 1970s and 1980s, with the world's population growth outpacing the production of food and other critical resources. Thanks to innovations and efforts such as the ""green revolution"" in farming and the widespread adoption of family planning, Ehrlich's worst fears did not come to pass. In fact, since the 1970s, global economic output has increased and fertility has fallen dramatically, especially in developing countries."
61,Nuclear Disorder,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/pakistan/2010-01-01/nuclear-disorder,Nuclear Disorder,"The global nuclear order today could be as fragile as the global financial order was two years ago, when conventional wisdom declared it to be sound, stable, and resilient. In the aftermath of the 1962 Cuban missile crisis, a confrontation that he thought had one chance in three of ending in nuclear war, U.S. President John F. Kennedy concluded that the nuclear order of the time posed unacceptable risks to mankind. ""I see the possibility in the 1970s of the president of the United States having to face a world in which 15 or 20 or 25 nations may have these weapons,"" he forecast. ""I regard that as the greatest possible danger."" Kennedy's estimate reflected the general expectation that as nations acquired the advanced technological capability to build nuclear weapons, they would do so. Although history did not proceed along that trajectory, Kennedy's warning helped awaken the world to the intolerable dangers of unconstrained nuclear proliferation."
62,An Elegy for Journalism?,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/elegy-journalism,An Elegy for Journalism?,"The twenty-first century has been a traumatic one for journalism. Changes in how people consume news, combined with the great recession of 2007-9 and the business equivalent of reckless driving by some proprietors (such as the real estate mogul Sam Zell's steering the Tribune Company into bankruptcy), have produced an era that in retrospect will seem, at best, severely chastening and, at worst, catastrophic."
63,The Better Half,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/review-essay/2010-01-01/better-half,The Better Half,"When U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton toured Africa in August 2009, she went out of her way to meet with women's groups -- female farmers in Kenya, rape victims in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, microfinance entrepreneurs across the continent. In South Africa, she spent twice as long visiting a women's housing project near Cape Town as she did meeting with the country's president, Jacob Zuma. Some quietly sniped that Clinton was devaluing her office by meeting with so many grass-roots female activists; others applauded the fact that a U.S. secretary of state had made women's rights a critical foreign policy issue. Clinton defended her agenda, noting that such attention serves to ""change the priorities"" of governments."
64,From Hope to Audacity,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/united-states/hope-audacity,From Hope to Audacity,"The foreign policy of U.S. President Barack Obama can be assessed most usefully in two parts: first, his goals and decision-making system and, second, his policies and their implementation. Although one can speak with some confidence about the former, the latter is still an unfolding process."

0,Schumpeter's Heirs,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/issue-packages/2014-12-12/schumpeters-heirs,What’s Inside,"The Austrian economist Joseph Schumpeter put entrepreneurs at the center of his model of capitalism. Innovation was crucial to dynamism and growth, he argued, and entrepreneurs were the ones who made innovation happen. The “new combinations” of economic factors they brought together propelled the whole system onward and upward. Moreover, their efforts were anything but ordinary or easy: “To act with confidence beyond the range of familiar beacons and to overcome [society’s] resistance requires aptitudes that are present in only a small fraction of the population.”"
1,The Intellectual Life of Edmund Burke: From the Sublime and Beautiful to American Independence,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2015-12-14/intellectual-life-edmund-burke-sublime-and-beautiful-american,The Intellectual Life of Edmund Burke: From the Sublime and Beautiful to American Independence,"In a sense, the debate between Burke and his antagonists—between conservatism and radicalism, broadly defined—has shaped political debate in the Western world since the late eighteenth century. Burke himself has become known as “the father of modern conservatism.” But David Bromwich is not fond of that phrase. “No serious historian today would repeat the commonplace that Burke was the father of modern conservatism,” writes the esteemed scholar of literature in his magnificent, beautifully written new study of the first half of Burke’s career, which is the most notable addition to a recent crop of books about Burke. The trouble is not only that the line between Burke and modern conservatism is hardly straight but also that Burke’s legacy is far too complex to be captured by any such phrase. Anyone hoping to understand Burke is confronted with an array of historians and philosophers of aesthetics, politics, and political theory; social conservatives and free-market liberals; and even closet radicals—all claiming that they hold the key to the “real” Burke. Undaunted, Bromwich sets out to demonstrate “the originality and continuities” of Burke’s thought. The result is an intellectual biography of the best kind. Bromwich seeks to convey “what it meant to think like Edmund Burke” and to demonstrate the coherence and relevance of Burke’s moral and political vision. With a remarkable level of detail and sensitivity, Bromwich makes a virtue out of what others lament as problematic: the relationship between Burke’s political activity and his written works. Bromwich is convinced that people today can still learn from Burke, not as political partisans but as “thoughtful readers.” In Bromwich’s hands, Burke offers better lessons about how to think than about what to think."
2,Eisenhower: A Life,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2014-12-15/eisenhower-life,Eisenhower: A Life,"Johnson likes Ike, and he thinks you should, too. This short and breezy volume makes the case that President Dwight Eisenhower was a military leader of genius, a successful university president, an exemplary husband, and a great chief executive of the United States. At times, Johnson seems so intent on his hagiographic mission that he gives short shrift to anything that casts doubt on Eisenhower’s virtue or genius, and this book is unlikely to stand as a serious contribution to the literature on the 34th president. Nevertheless, it is an entertaining read, spiced with malicious sideswipes at Eisenhower’s left-wing intellectual critics, and the book will serve well as an introduction to this important historical figure."
3,America’s Pastor: Billy Graham and the Shaping of a Nation,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2014-12-15/americas-pastor-billy-graham-and-shaping-nation,America’s Pastor: Billy Graham and the Shaping of a Nation,"Billy Graham was the most significant religious presence in American life from the late 1940s until well into the current era. Graham brought the revival movement and evangelical Protestantism into the modern world. His repudiation of segregation and his retreat from fundamentalism and moves toward a more complex view of the relationship between the Bible and contemporary thought helped reshape the American cultural landscape. Wacker’s engaging, comprehensive, and sympathetic (although not uncritical) study of Graham’s multifaceted career is an admirable introduction both to Graham and to the evangelical movement he worked so hard to build. A product of fundamentalist Christianity during the Jim Crow era in the rural South, Graham transformed himself into someone who could reach a much wider audience: in 2005, at the last of his open-air religious “crusades,” in New York City, the majority of the more than 100,000 attendees were people of color. Graham, now 97, no longer hits the revival trail, and the religious synthesis he helped popularize does not seem to be reaching younger Christians. Nevertheless, the individualistic religious tradition that shaped Graham’s worldview remains a potent force in American culture."
4,Outpost: Life on the Frontlines of American Diplomacy,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2014-12-15/outpost-life-frontlines-american-diplomacy,Outpost: Life on the Frontlines of American Diplomacy,"Hill, an eminent U.S. diplomat, focuses on three episodes in this memoir: his work with the U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke during the Balkan crises in the Clinton administration, his attempt to reach a nuclear agreement with North Korea during President George W. Bush’s second term, and his tenure as U.S. ambassador to Iraq under President Barack Obama. Hill, a masterful prose stylist who carries on a long tradition of literary excellence among U.S. diplomats, is generous to all the presidents and secretaries of state he served. He reserves his ire for the neoconservatives he believes attempted to sabotage the North Korean negotiations and for U.S. senators whose posturing and obstructionism further complicated the already difficult jobs of U.S. diplomats. The sections on Hill’s time in Iraq are deeply troubling: the overgrown U.S. embassy in Baghdad was chaotic and dysfunctional, and Washington never seems to have truly faced the sectarian and political problems that have now resulted in renewed tumult and war in that unhappy country."
5,Worthy Fights: A Memoir of Leadership in War and Peace,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2014-12-15/worthy-fights-memoir-leadership-war-and-peace,Worthy Fights: A Memoir of Leadership in War and Peace,"Panetta came to Washington during the Nixon administration as an idealistic young Republican. He later switched parties, rose through the Democratic ranks in Congress, and served as President Bill Clinton’s director of the Office of Management and Budget and chief of staff and as President Barack Obama’s director of the CIA and secretary of defense. This is a distinguished trajectory by any standard, and Panetta’s candid memoir offers a useful window into recent U.S. history. A few references to policy disagreements with Obama dominated the discussion of the book when it first appeared last year; the controversy seems overblown, as the book’s assessment of Obama is on the whole rather positive. Panetta’s most valuable insights involve federal budgets; few understand the subject as well. His account of how the Clinton administration was able to balance its final budgets shows how the U.S. political process can lead to good outcomes; his account of the sequester during the Obama administration shows how it can lead to terrible ones."
6,Putin’s Kleptocracy: Who Owns Russia?,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2014-12-15/putins-kleptocracy-who-owns-russia,Putin’s Kleptocracy: Who Owns Russia?,"“The story of this book,” Dawisha announces at its outset, is the “hope for political revanche,” by which she evidently means the Putin regime’s retaliation for Russia’s humiliation and weakness after the collapse of the Soviet Union. The bulk of the book concerns money—dirty money, in massive quantities—and the marvelously circuitous ways it has been amassed by Russian President Vladimir Putin, those around him, and the billionaires at one remove who kowtow to Putin’s regime. Dawisha’s book stands as the most detailed indictment of the venality that she argues has marked every step of Putin’s career. But the “political revanche” portion of her argument is less persuasive. She makes the case that from the very start, Putin and his circle planned to take Russia down an authoritarian path. But she is a bit fuzzy on just how much control Putin exerts over Russia’s kleptocracy and on how important he was to its emergence: indeed, her own evidence suggests that it was in place well before Putin became president. His contribution has been to increase the kleptocracy’s size."
7,Siberia: A History of the People,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2014-12-15/siberia-history-people,Siberia: A History of the People,"Siberia accounts for more than three-quarters of modern Russia’s territory and spans eight of the country’s 11 time zones but is home to just 30 million people. Images of Arctic winters, the Soviet gulag, and infinite wilderness tend to shape popular conceptions of Siberia. But in reality, the region is vastly more rich and varied, and its history, as related in this sweeping but compact account, features a wild diversity of settings, events, and inhabitants. Hartley’s book is a work of social, not political, history, and her primary focus is people: Cossacks, peasants in flight, indigenous groups pushed aside, political exiles, convicts, hunters, trappers, and oil men. Her stories unfold in villages and towns, in the military garrisons that secured this vast space, and in the prison camps where so many perished. Hartley cares most about the dramatic juxtapositions that characterize Siberia: free and unfree people, settlers and natives, indigenous beliefs and imported religions. In her book, Siberia emerges as an intricate, colorful mosaic, not a barren black-and-white photo."

Vol. 1, Paradoxes of Power, 1878–1928","Kotkin’s biography of Joseph Stalin is already monumental—and this is just the first entry in a planned trilogy. Stalin emerges here as a more vivid and complete figure than he does in countless other biographies. And the history surrounding the Soviet leader, as Kotkin reconstructs it, has a texture and arresting detail lacking in prior studies. The period Kotkin covers spans from Stalin’s birth in 1878 to the eve of Soviet collectivization and Stalin’s consolidation of power, in 1928. Kotkin manages to capture how a figure as larger than life, influential, and twisted as Stalin came to be by expanding the book’s boundaries beyond Russia and the Soviet Union during Stalin’s time to include other parts of the world and other historical eras. In so doing, Kotkin reveals how Stalin’s sense of geopolitical strategy and ability to seize opportunities shaped him, defined Russian and Soviet society, and determined international outcomes. Kotkin also shows how prior epochs and historical figures paved the way for the emergence of a person—or perhaps a phenomenon—as outsized as Stalin."
9,At Night We Walk in Circles,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2014-12-15/night-we-walk-circles,At Night We Walk in Circles,"Novels about the immigrant experience abound, but Alarcón offers an unusual spin on the genre: a tale about those left behind, in this case in an unidentified South American country that closely resembles the author’s native Peru. The protagonist, an aspiring actor, never fully recovers from his older brother’s emigration to California, which he interprets not as an act of adventurous entrepreneurship but rather as a cruel abandonment. Alarcón captures the milieu in Peru at the turn of the millennium, when the country was still reeling in the aftermath of a virulent civil war: disoriented lower-middle classes, frustrated artists, overcrowded prisons, a ubiquitous drug trade, and a new culture of commercialism. He artfully captures the dismal melancholy of Lima and the loneliness of the Andean highlands, the numbing winds blowing through desolate villages emptied of young people, who have left to seek better opportunities elsewhere. A suspenseful page-turner, At Night We Walk in Circles also features an anxious love triangle, in which the central female figure, Ixta, is at once irresistible, heartless, careless, and confused: a metaphoric stand-in, perhaps, for Peru itself."
10,The Washington Dissensus: A Privileged Observer’s Perspective on US-Brazil Relations; His Own Man,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2014-12-15/washington-dissensus-privileged-observers-perspective-us-brazil,The Washington Dissensus: A Privileged Observer’s Perspective on US-Brazil Relations; His Own Man,"Barbosa, who served as Brazil’s ambassador to Washington from 1999 to 2004, assesses U.S. diplomacy with a condescension born of wounded pride—a common feeling among his peers in Latin American diplomatic corps. But the distinguished diplomat’s hard-hitting memoir focuses its main attacks on his own country’s leadership, firing point-blank shots at then President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva and his foreign minister, Celso Amorim. Barbosa contends that the Lula administration’s anti-American posture harmed Brazilian national interests by foolishly wasting many opportunities to make real progress on promising U.S.-Brazilian agreements and by undermining Brazilian efforts to win a permanent seat on the un Security Council. In devastating detail, Barbosa portrays Brazil’s diplomats as confused about their fundamental purpose and undecided as to just what their country wants out of its relations with the United States—a lack of self-knowledge that only exacerbates the mistrust between Brasília and Washington. Barbosa’s provocative broadside will likely accelerate the ongoing debate in Brazil over how best to exploit its position as an emerging regional power."
11,Constructing Democratic Governance in Latin America; The Resilience of the Latin American Right,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2014-12-15/constructing-democratic-governance-latin-america-resilience-latin,Constructing Democratic Governance in Latin America; The Resilience of the Latin American Right,"Two recent books offer a chance to take stock of the political and ideological state of play in Latin America. Domínguez and Shifter’s volume is full of sharp insights—and some good news. In their summary chapters, the editors applaud Latin American countries’ deepening commitment to democratic institutions; freer, fairer, and more open elections; better governance; innovations in policymaking; and efforts to increase the prominence of women in leadership roles. Of course, many problems remain. The commodities boom of the past decade has strengthened all of the region’s rulers, including those with authoritarian traits. In some countries, narcotics trafficking has fueled gang violence that has overwhelmed law enforcement. As commodity markets cool off, perhaps the most important question across the region is whether democratic governments will be able to meet the rising expectations of their countries’ emerging middle classes. These issues and many others are covered in solid, well-informed chapters on Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Peru, and Venezuela. Other chapters explore constitutional reforms, the mass media, security challenges, and the natural resource boom. The writing is sophisticated enough to interest specialists but accessible enough for lay audiences."

These two countries have been at the center of almost every European policy initiative during the past half century, in just about every area: trade, the euro system, defense, regulation, immigration, eu enlargement, and so on. What accounts for the success of this joint leadership role, and is it likely to continue into the future? One way to answer those questions is to note that for all their cultural and social differences, the two countries are formally quite similar: both are democracies that have resolved their main internal ideological conflicts, and both face similar opportunities and external threats. But Krotz and Schild believe that such parallels explain very little and instead argue that the success of the Franco-German duo should be seen as the result of creative leadership by statesmen such as France’s Charles de Gaulle and François Mitterrand and Germany’s Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. They created a unique symbolic relationship, committed to the idea of overcoming past conflicts and establishing bilateral projects and consultative institutions. Franco-German reconciliation became a self-fulfilling prophecy, as publics, politicians, and officials began to expect and promote further cooperation over time."
13,Endgame for ETA: Elusive Peace in the Basque Country,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2014-12-15/endgame-eta-elusive-peace-basque-country,Endgame for ETA: Elusive Peace in the Basque Country,"Europeans have become accustomed to reports of anti-immigrant protests, threats from international terrorists, and regional separatism. Stories of compromise and integration receive less attention from the news media. But in recent years, a quiet success has taken place in Spain’s historically restive Basque Country. This book describes the peace process that recently resulted in a definitive end to what Whitfield correctly terms “the last organized armed insurgency in Western Europe.” Her account traces the decades-long negotiations between Basque separatists and Madrid, a process that began during the regime of General Francisco Franco. Both sides were frequently intransigent and beset by infighting. And by the time Madrid had become more flexible on the question of Basque autonomy, around ten years ago, violent splinter groups within the Basque separatist movement were launching a last-ditch terrorist campaign, which extended the conflict for nearly a decade. The precise position of the Basque Country within Spain remains unclear, but the two sides will likely be able to settle the remaining issues peacefully."

Arnold argues that the contemporary Anglo-American relationship is a bit of a sham: it demands British loyalty and subservience without securing any consistent American quid pro quo. The United Kingdom would be better served, he contends, by charting a more independent path: establishing closer links to European countries, engaging more with China, reaching a détente with Russia, withdrawing from NATO, reducing British involvement in military interventions around the world, removing U.S. bases from British territory, and increasing British support for global organizations such as the International Criminal Court."
15,Eichmann Before Jerusalem: The Unexamined Life of a Mass Murderer,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2014-12-12/eichmann-jerusalem-unexamined-life-mass-murderer,Eichmann Before Jerusalem: The Unexamined Life of a Mass Murderer,"In 1961, the political philosopher Hannah Arendt visited Israel to report on the trial of Adolf Eichmann, one of the main Nazi organizers of the Holocaust. In the resulting book, Eichmann in Jerusalem, Arendt coined the phrase “the banality of evil” to convey her central thesis: unspeakable crimes are carried out not by ideological fanatics but by ordinary, law-abiding officials, ignorant of the bigger picture and merely following normal bureaucratic routines. Yet this new book convincingly shows that Eichmann was no banal bureaucrat. He was a manipulative and unrepentant Nazi who cunningly deceived Arendt and many others at his trial by assuming the guise of a timid official. Stangneth’s research reveals that during the 15 years Eichmann spent hiding out in Argentina after World War II, he met with fellow Nazi fugitives, toiled away on a self-aggrandizing autobiography, and professed “no regrets” about the Holocaust—except that it hadn’t been thorough enough. Ultimately, the book reminds readers that in politics, even a banal person’s beliefs can be truly evil—and that in scholarship, even the cleverest conceits ultimately give way to banal historical research."

Tucker explores how new technologies have affected the state’s role as a collector and manipulator of information, examining how they have changed the nature of espionage and the quality of intelligence assessments. Tucker develops his argument methodically, looking at the role of information in counterintelligence and covert action, regular and irregular warfare. He concludes that the information age has been less transformational than supposed. Contrary to claims that new technologies have generally favored insurgents and revolutionaries, Tucker argues that they have likely benefited states even more. Although the book is not always convincing, it presents a serious and challenging analysis."
21,Clausewitz: His Life and Work,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2014-12-15/clausewitz-his-life-and-work,Clausewitz: His Life and Work,"Carl von Clausewitz was an outstanding young cadet in the Prussian army who never reached the high rank that he thought he deserved. In 1818, he was named director of the Prussian War College, an appointment he had not sought but that nonetheless gave him the time to work on his masterpiece, On War. Clausewitz died of cholera in 1831, having instructed his wife to organize the text and prepare it for publication. The book ultimately became a classic, and many experts in military affairs consider it the best book ever written on the subject. Stoker’s biography focuses mostly on Clausewitz’s military record, devoting just one chapter to the last 16 years of the Prussian’s life, during which time he wrote On War. This is a well-written and valuable addition to the Clausewitz library, but it also serves as a useful history of the Napoleonic Wars, as Stoker draws on Clausewitz’s sharp observations to illuminate some of the most important military engagements of that period."
22,The Perfect Kill: 21 Laws for Assassins,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2014-12-15/perfect-kill-21-laws-assassins,The Perfect Kill: 21 Laws for Assassins,"Assassination may well be an efficient use of force, but leaders are often wary of it for both moral and strategic reasons. But as many countries have been drawn into murky struggles against violent extremists, leaders have become more sanguine about “targeted killings,” especially if they are carried out from a distance, using drones. Baer, a former CIA operative, tells the story of his search for Imad Mughniyeh, a skilled Hezbollah member with a long and deadly record of orchestrating bombings, kidnappings, and assassinations. Mughniyeh—whom Baer chooses to refer to by the nom de guerre Hajj Radwan—was himself eventually killed in 2008, although not by the CIA. (Hezbollah’s leaders, and many others, contend that Israeli assassins did him in.) Baer explains that assassination requires dedication, self-discipline, and a degree of intimacy with one’s target—all reasons why he thinks the United States is unlikely to ever do it very well. This makes for a lively and challenging read, although the focus on Lebanon, where political murders are almost routine, does not allow Baer much room to explore the impact of assassination on places where it is rare."

Smith goes one step further and explores how such sensory assaults affect the conduct of war itself. Soldiers become disoriented; their skin is irritated by scrapes and infections; their mouths are left dry by dust. They drink unclean water and eat unclean fruit. Smith gets into these gritty details by narrating some of the most important encounters of the American Civil War: the noise of the shelling of Fort Sumter; the confusion caused by the proliferation of different uniforms and badges at the First Battle of Bull Run; the stench of death at Gettysburg, which lingered from July to October; the hunger caused by the siege of Vicksburg; and the claustrophobic conditions faced by the crew of a crude Confederate submarine. A leitmotif of the book is the way the aristocrats of the antebellum South took pride in their refined tastes and how that particular sense of superiority was undermined by the sheer brutality of the war’s violence."
24,Cowardice: A Brief History,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2014-12-15/cowardice-brief-history,Cowardice: A Brief History,"Why has nobody written this book before? “Coward” remains one of the English language’s harshest epithets, but its meaning has become less clear. The term was once reserved for those who turned away from physical danger. But the more that societies come to appreciate the fact of human frailty, the less cowardice appears as a moral failing and the less censorious people become of behavior that not long ago would have led, in a military context, to a court-martial and even execution. At the same time, societies have become less tolerant of a different kind of cowardice: silence in the face of egregious wrongdoing. In this elegant and thoughtful discussion that draws on literature and films as well as military case law, Walsh thoroughly explores how the concept of cowardice has evolved as a result of changes in the way societies understand morality, human nature, and the nature of war. In the end, he argues, societies need a firm concept of cowardice; without it, they cannot grasp what it means to act courageously."
25,The Horn of Africa,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2014-12-15/horn-africa-0,The Horn of Africa,"In recent decades, few places have been as mired in violence as the Horn of Africa, which is home to more than 200 million people. Mengisteab’s definition of the region includes eight countries: Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, and Uganda. His book provides a good introduction to the structural and historical causes of the conflicts that have roiled those places. Mengisteab details the negative impact of colonialism, the problems of state formation in ethnically fragmented territories, the misrule by elites who often favor their own ethnic and regional bases, the harmful effects of military interventions launched by states in the region and outside powers, and the ravages of environmental degradation. A final chapter somewhat optimistically identifies democratization and government reform as the necessary prerequisites for peace, economic development, and state construction. Mengisteab does not always adequately distinguish between the region’s eight countries, but he has done a masterful job of explaining a set of incredibly complicated conflicts in a complex and underexamined part of the world."

South Africa on the Brink of Failed Statehood,"Boraine, an influential white antiapartheid activist, has written a scathing critique of the African National Congress, the black-dominated party that has ruled South Africa for the past two decades. Boraine’s account of the party’s corruption breaks no new ground; nor does his argument that the ANC’s intolerance of criticism results from the antidemocratic internal culture the party forged during its long struggle for power. More interesting are the book’s details on the strategies the ANC has used to weaken the independence of the judiciary and emasculate the legislature while maintaining party unity. Boraine hopes that strains will eventually appear between the ANC’s different factions, but he doubts that any real threats to the party’s power will soon materialize. His focus on political maneuvering means that he spends less time exploring the ANC's disappointing record on promoting economic growth and alleviating poverty. Still, this heartfelt critique of South Africa’s status quo deserves to be read."

But Copnall shows that the cultural, political, and economic links between the countries remain dense and complicated and argues that the two sides need to forge a productive relationship if either is to thrive. His own analysis suggests that is unlikely: the divides are deep, and the leaders in both countries are corrupt and repressive. Shortly after they parted ways, the two countries fought bitterly over territory as both governments clamped down on domestic dissent. Copnall’s many interviews with officials and ordinary people on both sides lend the book real authority and a sense of genuine empathy for the people of the two Sudans."
28,Toxic Aid: Economic Collapse and Recovery in Tanzania,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2014-12-15/toxic-aid-economic-collapse-and-recovery-tanzania,Toxic Aid: Economic Collapse and Recovery in Tanzania,"Despite the title of this book, the heroes of Edwards’ entertaining account of Tanzania’s development in the 1980s and 1990s are the international donors who imposed reforms on the country’s socialist government after President Julius Nyerere’s policies had ruined the economy. In the immediate postindependence era, international aid had provided support to those same counterproductive policies—hence the toxicity referred to in the title. But by the early 1980s, the majority of donors had withdrawn their support and begun to condition future aid on reforms, including the thorough privatization and liberalization of the economy. Edwards argues that Tanzania’s adoption of this set of “Washington consensus” policies sped the country’s economic growth during the last two decades. His book is one of the most thorough and careful examinations of the subject of economic reform in Africa, and it benefits from the many interviews he conducted with key actors in Tanzania. Nonetheless, Edwards devotes too little attention to the many critics of the aid process in that country, who continue to question the true extent of the reforms’ success."
29,State-Building and Multilingual Education in Africa,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2014-12-12/state-building-and-multilingual-education-africa,State-Building and Multilingual Education in Africa,"Given how difficult it can be to create a sense of nationhood in places where people construct their identities from many different sources, one might think that large African states would try to educate their citizens in a single national language in order to promote national cohesion. But in fact, four out of five African countries officially encourage education in multiple local languages. Albaugh argues convincingly that this counterintuitive development stems from an odd alliance that formed in the 1990s among elites in African countries, donor states, and international nongovernmental organizations that worked on education. The democratization of the region in the 1990s forced African governing elites to find new tools for maintaining their power. By helping strengthen regional identities, local language instruction represented a way for central authorities to divide and conquer, since it discouraged subnational groups from forming opposition blocs. Meanwhile, Western donor states, especially France, believed that official education in vernacular languages would also make it more likely for Africans to learn European languages. Finally, nongovernmental educational organizations tended to prize cultural diversity over the exigencies of nation building and lobbied on behalf of multilingualism. Theoretically rich, well documented, and sophisticated in its argumentation, Albaugh’s book is one of the finest available on the origins of public policy and the process of state building in Africa."
30,The Cultural Logic of Politics in Mainland China and Taiwan,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2014-12-15/cultural-logic-politics-mainland-china-and-taiwan,The Cultural Logic of Politics in Mainland China and Taiwan,"One of the most vexing questions for scholars of China is whether Chinese political culture inherently supports authoritarian rule. Solid answers to that question have eluded political scientists for decades. This book by the late China scholar Shi represents an audacious and creative attempt to solve the puzzle. Through a sophisticated statistical analysis of survey data collected between 1993 and 2008 in mainland China and Taiwan, Shi reaches several surprising—and undoubtedly provocative—conclusions. He finds that structural change (such as economic development) and institutional transformation (democratization, in the case of Taiwan) have had no impact on cultural attitudes toward authority in the two societies. Because of the influence of traditional culture, Chinese people tend to be more trustful of and less confrontational toward authority. More important, the Chinese cultural conception of democracy differs fundamentally from its Western counterparts. In the West, democracy is defined in procedural terms. But in traditional Chinese culture, democracy is viewed as “guardianship.” If Shi’s argument is correct, the Chinese Communist Party’s rule may endure longer than many expect."
31,Powerful Patriots: Nationalist Protest in China’s Foreign Relations,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2014-12-15/powerful-patriots-nationalist-protest-chinas-foreign-relations,Powerful Patriots: Nationalist Protest in China’s Foreign Relations,"Are Chinese policymakers driven to take more assertive foreign policy positions by the pressure of nationalist public opinion, or do they merely use that opinion as a tool to strengthen their hand in negotiations with other powers? Weiss presents a nuanced but clear answer in favor of the latter position. Her study of 92 protest attempts from 1985 to 2012 finds that authorities restrained or prevented more demonstrations than they allowed but shows that some flexibility proved useful for diplomatic signaling. For example, in 2001, the Chinese government repressed a nascent anti-American protest in order to indicate its willingness to negotiate a solution to the crisis generated by a collision between a Chinese fighter jet and a U.S. spy plane. In 2005, on the other hand, Beijing added muscle to its campaign against the proposal to grant Japan a permanent seat on the un Security Council by allowing anti-Japanese protests. Weiss argues that attempting to exploit protests in this way also poses risks: it can cheapen the desired signaling effect, and it can provide useful cover for demonstrators who actually want to criticize the Chinese government itself."

But this innovative book argues that historically, the untouchables (or Dalits) were excluded less as a result of religious beliefs than on account of their economic role as bonded agricultural laborers. Viswanath explains that the religious aspect of untouchability began to take precedence only in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Protestant missionaries started the process by trying to convert Dalits to Christianity. The landed castes’ response to this perceived threat was to claim that subordinating the Dalits was a native custom that should be protected according to the British colonial policy of respect for local religious norms. The British chose to view the Dalits’ condition as the result of a voluntary contract, ignoring the ways in which the Dalits’ ritual status robbed them of economic autonomy. Even after independence, the idea of untouchability as a deep-rooted cultural and religious custom has prevented a full assault on what continues in many places to constitute a form of hereditary slavery."

The story of the Salim Group’s expansion into flour, cement, banking, noodles, and countless other fields illuminates the symbiotic relationship between businesspeople and politicians during the reign of Suharto, Indonesia’s president from 1967 until 1998. The Javanese-born Suharto and the Chinese-born Liem Sioe Liong were both tough men with smiling exteriors who held mystical beliefs and were fascinated by money. Suharto provided Liem with access and protection, and Liem served as a discreet source of funds for Suharto’s political and personal use. In the 1990s, Liem struggled to keep his footing as the increasingly erratic Suharto launched rhetorical attacks on the business class, dominated by ethnic Chinese, while tolerating rampant corruption by his cronies and even his own children. Borsuk and Chng’s sources were not shy about explaining how business was really done during Suharto’s time—and, no doubt, is still done—not only in Indonesia but also throughout Asia."
34,Three Books on China and the United States,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2014-12-15/three-books-china-and-united-states,Three Books on China and the United States,"Pillsbury and Haddick articulate some of the reasons behind Washington’s increasing anxiety about China. After decades of close contact with senior Chinese military officials, Pillsbury has come to believe that China aims not to simply defend its core interests, nor to merely match the power of the United States, but rather to achieve global economic, cultural, and military dominance. He sees China’s current assertiveness as the opening phase of a long-term effort to make the world safe for Chinese-style thought control, disregard for the environment, authoritarian rule, and arms proliferation. Despite the virtual inevitability that China will ultimately boast a far larger economy than the United States, Pillsbury contends that Washington can maintain preeminence as long as it begins to take the competition seriously instead of counting on common interests to generate cooperation from Beijing. Pungently written and rich in detail, this book deserves to enter the mainstream of debate over the future of U.S.-Chinese relations."
35,Four Books on the Arab Uprisings,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2014-12-15/four-books-arab-uprisings,Four Books on the Arab Uprisings,"The uprisings of 2011 were unprecedented in recent Arab history, as civilians took to the streets in massive numbers not to protest rising prices or condemn foreign governments but rather to demand the downfall of their own leaders. Arab countries have long ranked among the least free in the world, and the uprisings suggested that perhaps the region was about to come in from the autocratic cold. In four recently edited volumes, experts try to make sense of the uprisings and the subsequent regime changes, as well as the reversals and bloody stalemates that followed. Together, they shed some light on the basic question now facing the region: Is autocracy back for good, or did the protests signal the start of an irreversible march toward greater democracy that is merely stalled at the moment? In considering the origins of the uprisings, these volumes tend not to emphasize structural factors, such as the region’s high level of youth unemployment or its “youth bulge.” One might assume that, for example, a sevenfold increase in the number of unemployed educated people—which Tunisia experienced between 1994 and 2011—would be a major contributor to civil unrest. But the expert analyses collected by these four books tend to see other kinds of issues as more important in explaining why the uprisings occurred."

Remington, however, makes precisely that comparison, and he also considers how today’s Russian decrees compare to those issued by the tsars and Soviet rulers. Even in repressive systems, governing is a complex business, and lining up the necessary bureaucratic and legislative pieces involves complicated strategic calculations. Remington, a seasoned and exceedingly careful scholar, concludes that Russian President Vladimir Putin has to carefully weigh the costs and benefits of issuing presidential decrees on matters as fundamental as institutional reform and as narrow (albeit emotional) as changing the national anthem. In this way, his situation is not dissimilar to the one U.S. President Barack Obama faces when considering whether to work with Congress or govern through executive authority alone."

Greene spent 13 years in Russia observing, thinking about, and talking about the relationship between the Russian state and Russian citizens. That experience forms the empirical foundation for his insightful analysis of Russia’s peculiar form of authoritarianism. He grounds his discussion in an extremely efficient and succinct review of the evolving concept of civil society, beginning with the ideas of Locke and Rousseau and working his way to the theories that dominate contemporary social science. Out of this exercise, he produces his own working definition of the term “civil society”: “the nonviolent means by which individuals collectively seek sovereignty vis-à-vis the state.” By his reckoning, the “sporadic, low-level protests” that occur in Russia and “the antagonistic state responses they generate” suggest that the Russian political scene is less monolithic than it often seems."

Indeed, if governments knew just how distinct others’ perceptions were from their own, they would make far fewer deals. This is an intriguing argument, as counterintuitive arguments often are. Grynaviski uses the period of U.S.-Soviet détente in the early 1970s to illustrate how the outlooks each party falsely attributed to the other permitted a general easing of tensions and made possible some specific agreements, such as the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. Grynaviski convincingly argues that the Nixon administration miscalculated the likely Soviet reaction to U.S. proposals and thus trapped itself into an agreement it had not originally intended to achieve. Less persuasive is the book’s larger argument about the overall positive effects such misperceptions had on the Cold War. Grynaviski concludes with a fair and lucid exploration of some explanations for détente’s ultimate failure, all of which he faults for relying too much on a single factor. He is right: but then again, the same complaint could be made about his own approach."

Litan here sets out to explain a range of ideas that originated with academic economists and that subsequently influenced both economic policy and business practices—usually for good but occasionally for ill. He includes biographical sketches of many of those economists, including such luminaries as Paul Samuelson and Milton Friedman, but also less widely known figures, such as George Dantzig, a pioneer in operations research, and Alfred Kahn, who played a major role in airline deregulation. Litan focuses largely on microeconomic issues, on which economists tend to a agree more frequently than they do on macroeconomics; for example, most economists agree that incentives matter and that it is important to get them right. The topics covered by the book range widely: financial innovations (especially derivatives), matchmaking in labor markets (and in romance), auctions, the deregulation of transportation and communications, and data mining all receive attention. Litan also explores the possibility of applying economic ideas to the challenges of traffic congestion, rising health-care expenditures, and climate change."

Goodwin’s worthy book serves to remind readers that Lippmann was more than a mere pundit. Lippmann was a committed liberal, in the European sense, meaning that he favored free markets and a limited role for government. But he was pragmatic rather than dogmatic, and he objected to the shrinking of liberalism into the notion that government’s sole role is to protect property rights. Like his friend Friedrich Hayek, he abhorred monopolies, whether they were controlled by business or by unions, and he worried about the undue concentration of power in government hands—except during wartime, when he deemed such accumulated power necessary to defeat authoritarian Germany and Japan. He believed liberty had to be protected by good laws, which should include helping disadvantaged or unemployed people and taxing unearned income."

In his view, technological change in recent years has significantly reduced the need for some forms of labor, lowering employment levels as some jobs have become obsolete and shifting the distribution of income away from labor and toward capital and wealthy superstars. That shift has not produced levels of demand sufficient to create significant numbers of jobs. This is a more nuanced version of the suggestion that the U.S. economy (and perhaps others) has moved into a period of so-called secular stagnation. Galbraith urges Americans to adjust their country’s institutional structures—and their personal expectations—to accommodate a lower rate of growth than the one that prevailed during the past half century. He argues that U.S. economic policy should aim to provide greater income stability through increased social insurance, a higher minimum wage (which would reduce the demand for low-wage immigrant workers), and a higher estate tax. He also takes reasoned but forceful swipes at big banks, whose contributions to the well-being of the U.S. economy are highly doubtful, and criticizes the outdated and oversize national security sector."

But in this carefully documented study, Lardy shows that in reality, China’s private sector has continued to grow and thrive for the past 15 years and now accounts for more than three-quarters of industrial production and a comparable share of investment in industrial assets. Moreover, China’s private sector now attracts a growing (albeit still small) share of bank financing and enjoys notably higher rates of return than the country’s public sector, suggesting that private businesses are likely to continue to outpace state-owned enterprises. To be sure, the latter still dominate important sectors of the Chinese economy, such as banking, oil, telecommunications, and tobacco. But their relative importance has greatly receded and will likely continue to do so. Such observations make Lardy’s book an important addition to scholarship on China’s complex and rapidly changing economy."

Drezner argues the contrary: although the system did not prevent the crisis or the subsequent recession, it did avoid a catastrophe on the order of the Great Depression of the 1930s, successfully mitigating an economic shock of even greater force than the one that hit the global economy in 1929. The summit meetings held by the G-20 during the crisis were loosely coordinated but provided a way for policymakers to share perspectives and ideas. And international financial institutions, especially the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, rose to the occasion by offering enlarged and more flexible lending programs. Central banks, led and often aided by the U.S. Federal Reserve, also performed well. At the very least, they avoided the mistakes their predecessors made in the 1930s; as a result, significant fiscal stimulus occurred in most major countries. Drezner hesitates to forecast the future of the system, not least because serious misunderstandings among politicians and the public continue to distort views about the crisis and what lessons ought to be taken from it. But he convincingly argues that the system responded to a very real stress test surprisingly well."
45,Dictators at War and Peace,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2014-12-11/dictators-war-and-peace,Dictators at War and Peace,"Commentators on international affairs often assume that authoritarian states tend to pursue unpredictable and aggressive foreign policies. In this important book, Weeks demonstrates that this simplistic view misses important variations in how autocrats make decisions about the use of force. In authoritarian states run by institutionalized parties or groups, such as the Soviet Union in the post-Stalin era and contemporary China, leaders face a surprising amount of domestic accountability over decisions to use force. Weeks argues that these states actually tend to take cautious and prudent positions in foreign policy, not unlike leaders who must run for reelection in democracies. In contrast, authoritarian states in which individual rulers and their immediate circles control the instruments of the state and the military, such as North Korea and Iraq under Saddam Hussein, tend to be less mindful of domestic opinion and more willing to initiate international conflict. Weeks’ argument seems particularly relevant at the moment, since the resolution of a number of ongoing international standoffs might depend on whether certain countries—Iran and Russia, for example—behave more like the first type of authoritarian state or more like the second."
46,Writing History in the Global Era,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2014-12-15/writing-history-global-era,Writing History in the Global Era,"Ever since the study of history became an academic profession in the late nineteenth century, historians have been primarily occupied with writing national histories. That approach has become less tenable in recent decades as globalization has gained momentum. Meanwhile, according to Hunt, the social and cultural theories that have dominated the field since the 1950s have grown stale. Studying identity, gender, class, and culture remains an essential task, but in doing so, scholars tend to focus on individuals and local settings, ignoring global structures and forces. Hunt therefore sees the recent turn toward “global history” as a promising trend. This approach not only allows scholars to see the growing connections between nations in today’s world but also encourages the retelling of older histories from a global or transnational perspective. In Hunt’s view, the challenge is to give the new global history more theoretical heft and coherence without resorting to teleological or narrowly Western-centric notions of modernity. This challenge is not unique to history; it is a problem at the core of all the social sciences."
47,The Twilight of Human Rights Law,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2014-12-15/twilight-human-rights-law,The Twilight of Human Rights Law,"Beginning with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted by the UN General Assembly in 1948, countries have signed on to a widening array of treaties and conventions designed to protect human rights and backed by an expanding set of international courts, commissions, and monitoring bodies. But has all this human rights law and activism actually improved people’s lives? In this sharply argued book, Posner answers no. To be sure, a greater proportion of people around the world are freer today than ever before. But Posner argues that human rights law has been largely irrelevant to that improvement. Liberal democracies sign on to human rights treaties because they see the agreements as cost free, believing that they themselves already abide by the rules. Meanwhile, authoritarian states sign on solely for propaganda purposes and then find it fairly easy to flout the rules. Posner worries that the proliferation of human rights treaties encourages “rule naiveté”: an illusion that Western norms can be applied and impartially enforced everywhere. He urges Western countries to focus instead on promoting economic development, which can achieve real and measurable gains in improving people’s lives."
48,The End of American World Order,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/end-american-world-order,The End of American World Order,"In this lively polemic, Acharya takes aim at American thinkers who naively believe that rising non-Western states, such as China and India, will eventually join the U.S.-led international order as enthusiastic stakeholders. Such countries, he argues, hold different values from Western states, resent the special privileges that the United States retains as a hegemonic leader, and do not agree among themselves about what a post-American order should look like. Acharya foresees the emergence of a “multiplex” world, in which countries and regions will all (metaphorically) go to the same movie theater but end up watching different films. The book presents an imaginative vision of a less centralized, more pluralistic world, but it neglects to account for the forces of global integration that propelled non-Western states upward in the first place. The book also fails to appreciate the complex tension between non-Western countries’ discomfort with U.S. dominance of international governance institutions and their support for the ideal of an open, rule-based international order that is not strictly “American” but has rather resulted from decades of push and pull among many states, ideologies, and agendas."

Even after grasping truth and universal knowledge, one must still do the chores and confront the drudgery of everyday life. In many ways, that is Fukuyama’s message in this second volume of his masterful study of political development. Fukuyama became famous at the end of the Cold War after writing “The End of History?” In that essay (later expanded into a book), he asserted that the grand ideological questions about modernity and political order had been settled; as monarchy, fascism, and communism fell away, liberal democracy stood alone as a legitimate and successful system of government. Liberal democracies were far from perfect and continued to struggle with inequality, injustice, and poor performance. But these were primarily problems of “incomplete implementation”; unlike its vanquished rivals, liberal democracy was not plagued with inherently defective or self-contradictory principles."
50,Europe Reborn,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/europe/europe-reborn,Europe Reborn,"In 1982, The Economist marked the 25th anniversary of the European Economic Community, the precursor to the European Union, by featuring a tombstone dedicated to the organization on its cover. “Born March 25, 1957. Moribund March 25, 1982,” it read. Then came an epitaph courtesy of the ancient Roman historian Tacitus: Capax imperii nisi imperasset, “It seemed capable of being a power, until it tried to be one.” Inside, the magazine pilloried the community for its institutional weakness, bemoaned its citizens’ growing disenchantment with European integration, and warned of a possible British exit."
51,The Horn of Africa,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2014-12-15/horn-africa,The Horn of Africa,"In recent decades, few places have been as mired in violence as the Horn of Africa, which is home to more than 200 million people. Mengisteab’s definition of the region includes eight countries: Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, and Uganda. His book provides a good introduction to the structural and historical causes of the conflicts that have roiled those places. Mengisteab details the negative impact of colonialism, the problems of state formation in ethnically fragmented territories, the misrule by elites who often favor their own ethnic and regional bases, the harmful effects of military interventions launched by states in the region and outside powers, and the ravages of environmental degradation. A final chapter somewhat optimistically identifies democratization and government reform as the necessary prerequisites for peace, economic development, and state construction. Mengisteab does not always adequately distinguish between the region’s eight countries, but he has done a masterful job of explaining a set of incredibly complicated conflicts in a complex and underexamined part of the world.∂"

After all, the United States has produced many of the world’s finest entrepreneurs, from Andrew Carnegie and Henry Ford to Steve Jobs and Mark Zuckerberg. The American obsession with innovation has even invaded popular culture. Shark Tank, a reality television show in which entrepreneurs pitch to potential angel investors, has reached its sixth season and draws more than six million viewers a week. Silicon Valley, a new comedy on HBO, follows the founders of a technology start-up as they attempt to strike it rich. Meanwhile, the near-celebrity status of prominent tech entrepreneurs, such as Zuckerberg and Elon Musk, has spurred interest in the so-called STEM subjects—science, technology, engineering, and math—and in entrepreneurship more generally."
53,The Anti-Innovators,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/americas/anti-innovators,The Anti-Innovators,"For much of the last century, the United States led the world in technological innovation—a position it owed in part to well-designed procurement programs at the Defense Department and NASA. During the 1940s, for example, the Pentagon funded the construction of the first general-purpose computer, designed initially to calculate artillery-firing tables for the U.S. Army. Two decades later, it developed the data communications network known as the ARPANET, a precursor to the Internet. Yet not since the 1980s have government contracts helped generate any major new technologies, despite large increases in funding for defense-related R & D. One major culprit was a shift to procurement efforts that benefit traditional defense contractors while shutting out start-ups."
54,The Power of Market Creation,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/africa/2014-12-15/power-market-creation,The Power of Market Creation,"Most explanations of economic growth focus on conditions or incentives at the global or national level. They correlate prosperity with factors such as geography, demography, natural resources, political development, national culture, or official policy choices. Other explanations operate at the industry level, trying to explain why some sectors prosper more than others. At the end of the day, however, it is not societies, governments, or industries that create jobs but companies and their leaders. It is entrepreneurs and businesses that choose to spend or not, invest or not, hire or not."
55,The Innovative State,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/americas/2014-12-15/innovative-state,The Innovative State,"The conventional view of what the state should do to foster innovation is simple: it just needs to get out of the way. At best, governments merely facilitate the economic dynamism of the private sector; at worst, their lumbering, heavy-handed, and bureaucratic institutions actively inhibit it. The fast-moving, risk-loving, and pioneering private sector, by contrast, is what really drives the type of innovation that creates economic growth. According to this view, the secret behind Silicon Valley lies in its entrepreneurs and venture capitalists. The state can intervene in the economy—but only to fix market failures or level the playing field. It can regulate the private sector in order to account for the external costs companies may impose on the public, such as pollution, and it can invest in public goods, such as basic scientific research or the development of drugs with little market potential. It should not, however, directly attempt to create and shape markets. A 2012 Economist article on the future of manufacturing encapsulated this common conception. “Governments have always been lousy at picking winners, and they are likely to become more so, as legions of entrepreneurs and tinkerers swap designs online, turn them into products at home and market them globally from a garage,” the article stated. “As the revolution rages, governments should stick to the basics: better schools for a skilled workforce, clear rules and a level playing field for enterprises of all kinds. Leave the rest to the revolutionaries.”"
56,The Calm Before the Storm,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/africa/calm-storm,The Calm Before the Storm,"Even as protests spread across the Middle East in early 2011, the regime of Bashar al-Assad in Syria appeared immune from the upheaval. Assad had ruled comfortably for over a decade, having replaced his father, Hafez, who himself had held power for the previous three decades. Many pundits argued that Syria’s sturdy police state, which exercised tight control over the country’s people and economy, would survive the Arab Spring undisturbed. Compared with its neighbor Lebanon, Syria looked positively stable. Civil war had torn through Lebanon throughout much of the 1970s and 1980s, and the assassination of former Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri in 2005 had plunged the country into yet more chaos."
57,Leaving the West Behind,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/western-europe/leaving-west-behind,Leaving the West Behind,"Russia’s annexation of Crimea in March 2014 was a strategic shock for Germany. Suddenly, Russian aggression threatened the European security order that Germany had taken for granted since the end of the Cold War. Berlin had spent two decades trying to strengthen political and economic ties with Moscow, but Russia’s actions in Ukraine suggested that the Kremlin was no longer interested in a partnership with Europe. Despite Germany’s dependence on Russian gas and Russia’s importance to German exporters, German Chancellor Angela Merkel ultimately agreed to impose sanctions on Russia and helped persuade other EU member states to do likewise."

In 2010, William Lynn, then deputy secretary of defense, wrote in these pages that cyberspace was “just as critical to military operations as land, sea, air, and space.” As defense secretary, Leon Panetta warned of a “cyber–Pearl Harbor.” And in 2013, James Clapper, the director of national intelligence, put cyberattacks at the top of his annual list of transnational threats."

60,How to Think Like Edmund Burke,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/review-essay/2014-12-15/how-think-edmund-burke,How to Think Like Edmund Burke,"Edmund Burke, the eighteenth-century British politician and writer, is today best known for Reflections on the Revolution in France, published in 1790. In it, Burke denounced the revolutionaries in France and their supporters in Great Britain for what he considered their misplaced faith in principles such as “abstract liberty” and “the rights of men” and for their rejection of more pragmatic, procedural paths to ending the tyranny of hereditary monarchy. As Burke put it:"
61,Darkness Invisible,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/africa/darkness-invisible,Darkness Invisible,"Four years ago, a team of scholars from the Harvard School of Public Health and the World Economic Forum prepared a report on the current and future global economic burden of disease. Science and medicine have made tremendous progress in combating infectious diseases during the past five decades, and the group noted that noncommunicable diseases, such as heart disease and diabetes, now pose a greater risk than contagious illnesses. In 2010, the report’s authors found, noncommunicable diseases caused 63 percent of all deaths around the world, and 80 percent of those fatalities occurred in countries that the World Bank characterizes as low income or middle income. Noncommunicable diseases are partly rooted in lifestyle and diet, and their emergence as a major risk, especially in the developing world, represents the dark side of the economic advances that have also spurred increased longevity, urbanization, and population growth. The scale of the problem is only going to grow: between 2010 and 2030, the report estimated, chronic noncommunicable diseases will reduce global GDP by $46.7 trillion."
62,The G-Word,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/g-word,The G-Word,"One hundred years ago this April, the Ottoman Empire began a brutal campaign of deporting and destroying its ethnic Armenian community, whom it accused of supporting Russia, a World War I enemy. More than a million Armenians died. As it commemorates the tragedy, the U.S. government, for its part, still finds itself wriggling on the nail on which it has hung for three decades: Should it use the term “genocide” to describe the Ottoman Empire’s actions toward the Armenians, or should it heed the warnings of its ally, Turkey, which vehemently opposes using the term and has threatened to recall its ambassador or even deny U.S. access to its military bases if the word is applied in this way? The first course of action would fulfill the wishes of the one-million-strong Armenian American community, as well as many historians, who argue that Washington has a moral imperative to use the term. The second would satisfy the strategists and officials who contend that the history is complicated and advise against antagonizing Turkey, a loyal strategic partner."

In 1990, soon after getting a bachelor’s degree in mechanical engineering and a master’s in computer science, both from MIT, she teamed up with a professor and a fellow student to found iRobot, a company devoted to making practical robots for consumers, businesses, and the military. Among its many products, the company developed the PackBot, a small mobile robot that can scout out dangerous situations, and the Roomba, a vacuuming robot designed for home use. The company went public in 2005. In 2008, Greiner left to found CyPhy Works, a start-up focusing on flying robots, or drones. Foreign Affairs editor Gideon Rose spoke to her in early November."
68,The Art of the Cell,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/interviews/2014-12-08/art-cell,The Art of the Cell,"A native of La Paz, Bolivia, Marcelo Claure graduated from Bentley College, in Waltham, Massachusetts, in 1993 with a degree in economics. His first job afterward was with the Bolivian Football Federation. A year later, the Bolivian national soccer team landed a spot in the World Cup, and Claure, back in Massachusetts, landed a partial stake in USA Wireless, which he built into a leading wireless retailer in New England. Three years later, he struck out on his own and founded Brightstar, a Miami-based cell-phone distributor specializing in the Latin American market. By 2013, it was the 55th-largest private company in the United States. Then the Japanese telecommunications company SoftBank took a majority stake in Brightstar, and SoftBank’s founder, Masayoshi Son, installed Claure as CEO of another one of his properties, Sprint. In November, Claure spoke to Foreign Affairs deputy managing editor Stuart Reid at Sprint’s headquarters, in Overland Park, Kansas."
69,Exit Music,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/middle-east/2014-12-03/exit-music,Exit Music,"In describing what he characterizes as a bungled U.S. exit from Iraq, Rick Brennan (“Withdrawal Symptoms,” November/December 2014) presents an incomplete picture. For one thing, he overestimates the desire among Iraq’s leaders for U.S. forces to stay in the country past 2011, the date by which Iraq and the United States agreed that the U.S. military presence would end. When U.S. troops withdrew from Iraq’s major population centers in 2009, Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki announced triumphantly that his country had finally “repelled the invaders.” It’s true that Maliki sent mixed signals at times and that he might have exaggerated his opposition to the presence of U.S. forces for the benefit of domestic audiences. But the Iraqi parliament consistently opposed Washington’s insistence that it grant legal immunity from Iraqi law to U.S. troops who stayed past 2011. Members of parliament knew their refusal to do so would doom any agreement on allowing U.S. troops to remain longer. Their public stance on this issue, and not Maliki’s alleged flex-ibility in private, is the single best gauge of the Iraqi elite’s attitude toward the prospect of an extended U.S. military presence."

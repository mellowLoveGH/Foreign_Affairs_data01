During the Civil War, he emerged as a deft diplomat and sought to coordinate his military and political policies at home with the needs of U.S. diplomacy. Peraino begins with Lincoln’s opposition to the Mexican-American War and chronicles his later management, as president, of relations with France and the United Kingdom during the Civil War. A form of intellectual isolationism frequently mars the work of American historians, who often study U.S. politicians without appreciating how those figures’ perceptions of events overseas influenced their ideas about their country’s role in global affairs. Lincoln in the World avoids this pitfall, and although it is not the final word on some of the subjects it treats, it is an important step toward a richer and more useful understanding of the American past.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

Their legal prescriptions ignore constitutional history and, if followed, would drastically weaken U.S. foreign policy. The authors may not like the contemporary practice of international law, but their own ideas are painfully antiquated, better suited to an insular nineteenth-century nation than the great power the United States has become."

Yet conventional wisdom holds that politics is not at fault when it comes to banking crises and that such crises instead result from unforeseen and extraordinary circumstances."

I had just returned home from playing indoor tennis on the chilly, windy Sunday afternoon of March 16, 2008. A senior official of the U.S. Federal Reserve Board of Governors was on the phone to discuss the board’s recent invocation, for the first time in decades, of the obscure but explosive Section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act. Broadly interpreted, that section empowered the Federal Reserve to lend nearly unlimited cash to virtually anybody: in this case, the Fed planned to loan nearly $29 billion to J.P. Morgan to facilitate the bank’s acquisition of the investment firm Bear Stearns, which was on the edge of bankruptcy, having run through nearly $20 billion of cash in the previous week."
11,Cyberwar and Peace,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/cyberwar-and-peace,Cyberwar and Peace,"Cyberwar Is Coming!” declared the title of a seminal 1993 article by the RAND Corporation analysts John Arquilla and David Ronfeldt, who argued that the nascent Internet would fundamentally transform warfare. The idea seemed fanciful at the time, and it took more than a decade for members of the U.S. national security establishment to catch on. But once they did, a chorus of voices resounded in the mass media, proclaiming the dawn of the era of cyberwar and warning of its terrifying potential. In February 2011, then CIA Director Leon Panetta warned Congress that “the next Pearl Harbor could very well be a cyberattack.” And in late 2012, Mike McConnell, who had served as director of national intelligence under President George W. Bush, warned darkly that the United States could not “wait for the cyber equivalent of the collapse of the World Trade Centers.”"
12,Accepting Austerity,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2013-10-15/accepting-austerity,Accepting Austerity,"On March 1, 2013, the U.S. Department of Defense lost $37 billion overnight to sequestration. The cut marked the first wave of a series of planned cutbacks that will shrink future budgets across the federal government by about $1 trillion over nine years. The reductions had been set in motion back in 2011, when a special “super committee” established by the Budget Control Act (BCA) failed to reach a deficit-reduction agreement, triggering automatic cuts designed to punish both parties. Unlike other budget cuts, sequestration is implemented across the board, taking the same percentage bite out of every account. Except for the decision to spare the military personnel account that provides the pay for the United States’ men and women in uniform, defense leaders had no choice about where to take the 2013 cuts. And so, with just seven months left in the fiscal year, sequestration abruptly erased about eight percent of the the Pentagon’s budget for the year."

But criminals and terrorists could manipulate such advances to disrupt public safety and national security. Since its founding in 1923, Interpol has learned that the most effective way to keep up with a constantly changing world is by engaging law enforcement and consulting experts in its 190 member countries. Effective solutions to new global security threats require the exchange of information and intelligence. As the methods criminals employ have developed, so, too, has Interpol’s capacity for deploying new strategies and offering assistance to stop them."
14,Biology's Brave New World,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/world/biologys-brave-new-world,Biology’s Brave New World,"In May 2010, the richest, most powerful man in biotechnology made a new creature. J. Craig Venter and his private-company team started with DNA and constructed a novel genetic sequence of more than one million coded bits of information known as nucleotides. Seven years earlier, Venter had been the first person in history to make a functioning creature from information. Looking at the strings of letters representing the DNA sequence for a virus called phi X174, which infects bacteria, he thought to himself, “I can assemble real DNA based on that computer information.” And so he did, creating a virus based on the phi X174 genomic code. He followed the same recipe later on to generate the DNA for his larger and more sophisticated creature. Venter and his team figured out how to make an artificial bacterial cell, inserted their man-made DNA genome inside, and watched as the organic life form they had synthesized moved, ate, breathed, and replicated itself."

It certainly acts that way: three years ago, after Chelsea Manning, an army private then known as Bradley Manning, turned over hundreds of thousands of classified cables to the anti-secrecy group WikiLeaks, U.S. authorities imprisoned the soldier under conditions that the UN special rapporteur on torture deemed cruel and inhumane. The Senate’s top Republican, Mitch McConnell, appearing on Meet the Press shortly thereafter, called WikiLeaks’ founder, Julian Assange, “a high-tech terrorist.”"

17,"A Kinder, Gentler Immigration Policy",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2013-10-15/kinder-gentler-immigration-policy,"A Kinder, Gentler Immigration Policy","Ever since Congress passed the Immigration Reform and Control Act, in 1986, attempts at a similar comprehensive reform of U.S. immigration policies have failed. Yet today, as the Republican Party smarts from its poor performance among Hispanic voters in 2012 and such influential Republicans as former Florida Governor Jeb Bush have come out in favor of a new approach, the day for comprehensive immigration reform may seem close at hand. President Barack Obama was so confident about its prospects that he asked for it in his State of the Union address in February 2013. Now, the U.S. Senate looks poised to offer illegal immigrants a pathway to citizenship. But a top-down legislative approach to immigration could nonetheless easily die in Congress, just as the last serious one did, in 2007. Indeed, the president’s domestic problems with health care and foreign problems with Syria have already cast a shadow over the prospects for reform. Even if a bill did manage to pass, the sad fact is that it would work no better than the 1986 law did. That act was based on the assumption that punishments, such as sanctions on employers and heightened border security, and incentives, such as an increase in the number of legal immigrants allowed to enter the country and amnesty for illegal immigrants already there, could eliminate illegal immigration altogether. That assumption proved illusory: the offer of amnesty may have temporarily reduced the stock of illegal immigrants, but it was not enough to eliminate it. Nor did employer sanctions and border enforcement reduce the flow of new illegal immigrants.  The challenges to eliminating illegal immigration are, if anything, greater today than they were in 1986. For one thing, in order to make today’s proposals politically feasible, their authors decided to offer illegal immigrants not immediate unconditional amnesty but a protracted process of legalization. Confronted with this approach, a large share of the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants now living in the United States would likely choose to remain illegal rather than gamble on the distant promise of naturalization.  Nor would reform dissuade new illegal immigrants from joining those already in the country. Extrapolating from the recent drop in apprehensions near the Rio Grande, some analysts have argued that since the flow of illegal immigrants has already slowed to a trickle, the issue has lost its urgency. This notion is misguided. One cannot focus just on the area around the Rio Grande, since only half of all illegal immigrants residing in the United States entered the country by unlawfully crossing the U.S.-Mexican border, according to a 2006 study by the Pew Research Center. Moreover, whatever drop-off has occurred is mostly the result of the recent economic slowdown in the United States and will not prove permanent. As long as wages in the United States greatly outstrip those in poor countries, the United States will remain a mecca for potential immigrants, legal and illegal. Not only would immigration reform fail to achieve its goal of eliminating illegal immigrants; it would also lead to increasingly draconian treatment of them. In order to appease anti-immigrant groups, the Senate’s immigration reform bill provides for stricter enforcement of the U.S.-Mexican border, along with $40 billion in funding. But past experience suggests that such regulations are an exercise in futility: they do little to slow the influx of illegal immigrants while greatly increasing the risk to their lives as they try to cross the border over more dangerous terrain, aided by unscrupulous smugglers who may abandon them mid-journey. Given these realities, the United States should stop attempting to eliminate illegal immigrants -- since that will never work -- and focus instead on policies that treat them with humanity. Doing so would mean adopting a variety of measures to diminish the public’s hostility to illegal immigrants. Principal among them would be a shift from a top-down approach to a bottom-up one: letting states compete for illegal immigrants. States with laws that were unfriendly to illegal immigrants would lose them and their badly needed labor to states that were more welcoming. The result would be a competition that would do far more to improve the treatment of illegal immigrants than anything coming from Washington. IMPOSSIBLE DIFFICULTIES Americans can be schizophrenic when it comes to illegal immigration, suffering from a sort of right-brain, left-brain problem. The right brain sympathizes with illegal immigrants, since they are immigrants, after all, and the United States was founded on immigration. But the left brain fixates on their illegality, which offends Americans’ respect for the rule of law. Negotiating a viable compromise between those who wish to throw illegal immigrants out and those who wish to embrace them has always proved exceptionally difficult. As the historian Mae Ngai has shown, U.S. immigration policy in the 1920s and 1930s was as conflicted as it is today, with proponents of deportations pitted against pro-immigrant humanitarian groups.  Further complicating matters is Americans’ sense of fairness. Liberals have called on Congress to offer illegal immigrants a path to citizenship, but unlike most other countries, the United States has an enormous backlog of potential immigrants who have dutifully lined up for entry -- an issue that Spain, for example, did not face when it granted its illegal immigrants amnesty in 2005. Many Americans consider it unfair to let immigrants who have broken the law join the same line that those who followed the rules are in. The proponents of amnesty have, in consequence, cluttered up their proposed policy with various restrictions and requirements that make it far less attractive than a forthright granting of full citizenship. Like past reform proposals, the current one offers illegal immigrants a long road to legality. But the longer the process, the greater the risk that a new Congress will reverse the old. Many illegal immigrants may prefer not to accept that risk and instead stay illegal. Furthermore, as the immigration scholars Mark Rosenzweig, Guillermina Jasso, Douglas Massey, and James Smith have shown, around 30 percent of U.S. immigrants achieve legal status despite having violating immigration laws in the past. Taking these factors into account, it is reasonable to predict that of the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants, only half would take an offer of amnesty, perhaps less. Just like the chimera of legalizing away the stock of illegal immigrants, the notion that the flow of new illegal immigrants can be shut off is also deeply impractical. For instance, attempts at expanding legal immigration in the hope that it will reduce the incentive for illegal immigration would require, at minimum, vastly expanded legal admissions. Yet even though trade unions have given up their long-standing opposition to legalizing illegal immigrants -- which they figure will boost their membership -- they oppose significantly expanding legal admissions. Unions have long blamed immigration for the stagnation of workers’ wages, just as they have blamed outsourcing and trade liberalization. In fact, the AFL-CIO recently suggested that it should be involved in determining how many legal guest workers the United States will admit in the future. When President George W. Bush proposed a more expansive guest-worker program, unions helped kill the measure, and they would fiercely fight any efforts to liberalize legal immigration this time, too.  It is also dubious that draconian enforcement measures, at the border or internally, would actually intimidate would-be illegal immigrants, no matter what mix of punishments and inducements Congress legislates. Unlike in 1986, almost every U.S. immigrant is now more secure: their ethnic compatriots will, as they already do, go to bat for better treatment, raising their voices against such measures.  But the biggest hurdle that immigration reform faces is that as long as immigration restrictions exist, people will continue to enter the United States illegally. The government can send as many Eliot Nesses to Chicago to nab as many Al Capones as it wants, but the bootlegged liquor will keep flowing across the Canadian border as long as Prohibition remains in place. IMMIGRATION INHUMANITY Short of dismantling all border restrictions, then, no policy could magically eliminate illegal immigration. Yet not only would a reform bill be ineffective; it could also be harmful. If a comprehensive reform bill were passed, there is a serious danger that policymakers, operating on the flawed assumption that there should then be no reason for illegal immigrants to exist, might enact even harsher measures against them. In fact, merely attempting to secure support for a reform bill is certain to harm illegal immigrants. Their experiences under President Bill Clinton and Obama have not been reassuring. Although Democrats have generally been more sympathetic to illegal immigrants than have Republicans, both Clinton and Obama, in their attempts to secure bipartisan consensus on immigration reform, implemented ruthless measures against illegal immigrants. In the wake of the Immigration Reform and Control Act, the U.S. government ramped up enforcement at the border, which reached new heights during the Clinton administration. Ditches were built and fences constructed. To seal off common routes of entry into the United States, the government mounted military-style actions with names that seemed straight out of a war room: Operation Blockade, in El Paso in 1993; Operation Gatekeeper, in San Diego in 1994; and many more. The border security budget skyrocketed, rising from $326 million in 1992 to $1.1 billion by the time President George W. Bush took office, in 2001. The number of U.S. Border Patrol agents stationed at the southwestern border nearly tripled. In the end, these measures did little to stem the inflow. The demographer Jeffrey Passel of the Pew Research Center has estimated that the average net annual influx of illegal immigrants crossing the Rio Grande rose from 324,000 in the first half of the 1990s to 654,800 in the second half of the decade.  What stricter enforcement did do was force illegal immigrants to bypass safer crossing points and travel through the desert instead. Desperate immigrants made no secret of their desire to keep trying to sneak across the border despite heightened enforcement, often attempting again and again until they got through. But crossing the desert meant that they had to pay smugglers, known as coyotes, who left carloads of illegal immigrants for dead when they feared apprehension by U.S. Border Patrol personnel. At best, the Clinton administration’s policies had a marginal impact on illegal border traffic and led to a major decline in the welfare of those trying to enter the country illegally. They also failed to achieve their larger objective of getting legislation through Congress; the “keep them out” and “throw them out” lobbies were too strongly opposed to any compromise. Obama has ramped up border enforcement, too, but he has also deported record numbers of illegal immigrants already living in the United States. In 2011, he expanded the Secure Communities initiative, a joint effort between state and local governments -- the federal authorities have even ordered uncooperative states, such as New York, to fall in line -- that uses integrated databases to track down illegal immigrants. According to official statistics, the number of deportations (excluding apprehensions at the border itself) has risen under Obama, to 395,000 in 2009. In 2001, under George W. Bush, deportations numbered only 189,000. The focus on border enforcement is misguided. In part, it owes to the false equation of lax border control with the influx of terrorists. There is little evidence of that link: even the 9/11 hijackers entered the United States legally. Moreover, correcting for the effect of the recession on attempted crossings, it is clear that the impact of Obama’s policies has been far from dramatic in deterring illegal immigration. But the distress caused to illegal immigrants has been great. As a 2011 report from Human Rights Watch detailed, tens of thousands of immigrants are shuffled from jail to jail awaiting deportation. Once again, the country has gained little and lost much. RACE TO THE TOP With top-down immigration reform unworkable and inhumane, Americans need to shift their focus to treating their inevitable neighbors with humanity. That objective cannot be pursued through Washington. It must come from elsewhere: competition among states. States that harass illegal immigrants, such as Alabama, Arizona, Georgia, Indiana, and South Carolina, will drive illegal immigrants to more welcoming states, such as Maryland, New York, Utah, and Washington. As the former lose badly needed cheap labor to the latter, the political equilibrium will shift toward those who favor policies that help retain and attract illegal immigrants. Of course, states cannot intrude on the parts of immigration enforcement over which the federal government has exclusive authority, such as border control and civil rights. But there are a number of steps states can take to make life easier for illegal immigrants, such as issuing them driver’s licenses and making accessible to them everything from health care to university scholarships.  Illegal immigrants are already voting with their feet, leaving or bypassing states that treat them harshly and flocking to those with more benign policies. In 2011, hours after a federal judge in Alabama upheld most of the state’s strict immigration law, illegal immigrants began fleeing. Frightened families, The New York Times reported, “left behind mobile homes, sold fully furnished for a thousand dollars or even less.” The article continued: “Two, 5, 10 years of living here, and then gone in a matter of days, to Tennessee, Illinois, Oregon, Florida, Arkansas, Mexico -- who knows? Anywhere but Alabama.” Ample statistical evidence demonstrates this pattern. From 1990 to 2010, when tough border-enforcement policies (which naturally focused on the border states) were in vogue, Arizona, California, New Mexico, and Texas saw their collective share of illegal immigrants decline by 17 percent. In California alone, the percentage of all illegal immigrants residing there fell from 43 percent to 23 percent. Similarly, the economists Sarah Bohn, Magnus Lofstrom, and Steven Raphael have calculated that Arizona’s 2007 Legal Arizona Workers Act, which banned businesses from hiring illegal immigrants, led to a notable decline in the proportion of the state’s foreign-born Hispanic population. The resulting blow to economic activity has often been drastic; employers in agriculture and construction, for example, regularly complain about the absence of workers. Fortunately, however, as business interests begin to agitate in favor of easing up on illegal immigrants, state capitals will start taking note. Already, many groups in the unwelcoming states have begun to question their states’ draconian immigration enforcement laws and argue for more modest measures. After Alabama passed its immigration law, for example, business leaders complained to lawmakers about the resulting labor shortages. After the Legal Arizona Workers Act went into effect, in 2008, the state’s contractors’ trade association even joined civil rights groups in seeking the law’s repeal. That same year, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce filed a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of an Oklahoma law that required employers to verify the work status of their employees. As this dynamic plays out, states will begin to compete for illegal immigrants, who will then face less harassment and be able to better integrate into their communities. Democrats and Republicans who care about human rights should welcome this change. More important, so should Republicans who prize states’ rights. A race to the top in the treatment of illegal immigrants is a viable path to reform that would greatly advance human rights in the United States.  There are other ways to improve the lives of illegal immigrants that also do not involve Washington. Consider the problem of Mexicans who risk their lives traveling through the desert while attempting to cross the border and who occasionally damage the property of Texan ranchers. With no method to recoup their losses, the affected ranchers found it tempting to join forces with the Minutemen vigilantes who used to patrol the border. To reduce ranchers’ hostility toward illegal immigrants, the Mexican government should set up a fund that compensates ranchers who can establish credible claims of damage. Since the stories of such damages tend to outstrip the reality, the fund need not be particularly large to go a long way in defusing the hostility.  Another way to improve the plight of illegal immigrants would be for Mexico to help pay for the education and medical expenses of those illegal immigrants coming from Mexico that are otherwise borne by the U.S. government. Although a number of studies show that illegal immigrants represent a net contribution to U.S. government coffers, the common perception that American taxpayers must bear these costs and that Mexico should share some of the burden of its own citizens breeds resentment. Were the Mexican government to make such a contribution, it would serve as a gesture of goodwill that could help reduce the hostility toward illegal immigrants. “Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses,” reads the poem by Emma Lazarus that adorns the Statue of Liberty, which once welcomed the millions of immigrants arriving at Ellis Island. It is well past time to revive that sense of humanity, and the diverse recommendations outlined here can help the United States do just that. Whether or not they come with Washington’s permission, immigrants to the United States nonetheless deserve the compassion Lazarus promised."

In 2003, President Olusegun Obasanjo appointed Nuhu Ribadu as chair of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, a position he would retain until 2008, when Obasanjo’s successor, Umaru Yar’Adua, removed him. During his tenure, Ribadu became a hero to many Nigerians for transforming the commission into a relatively effective anticorruption vehicle, indicting hundreds of prominent Nigerians for various economic crimes. In 2009, following several attempts on his life amid fierce counterattacks by many of the powerful people he had taken on, Ribadu left the country. Although the book meanders a bit and could have been improved by some aggressive editing, it tells an engaging story, full of striking details about the numerous cases that marked Ribadu’s tenure. Readers will be rewarded with a thorough education in the personalities, practices, and political culture that allow billions of dollars of Nigerian state revenues to disappear every year.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

Without attracting much outside scrutiny, these countries have managed to squander enormous amounts of oil money while barely improving the lives of their citizens. The report reveals some particularly damning facts: for instance, Cameroon cannot account for an estimated 35 percent of its oil revenues since 1977. The report’s central argument is that these states could improve how they spend their oil wealth, increasing economic growth and alleviating poverty in the process. Each of these countries lags sharply behind other countries at its national income level in terms of social indicators such as literacy and infant mortality. The contributors, mostly staff economists of the IMF, are too polite to acknowledge that the improvements in policy they advocate are highly unlikely to come about so long as the governments that rule these countries continue their practice of using oil wealth to purchase the loyalty and unity of elites.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

Yet this massive country in the continent’s center covers nearly as much territory as western Europe and neighbors nine other African states, so it is hard to believe that the continent’s economic prospects are not at least in part tied to those of Congo. These three new books offer keen insights into the political and civil strife that have wracked Congo for decades and that the country seems far from resolving."

These questions are especially tough for India, with its history of communal divisions, diasporas, and refugee inflows. Muslims who fled to Pakistan at the time of the partition and then came back had a harder time getting citizenship than Hindus in the same situation. Some state governments have refused to implement citizenship rights for certain tribal populations, even though their rights are recognized by the national government. Since India does not recognize citizenship based on birth on Indian soil, some refugee communities have remained stateless for several generations. At the other end of the spectrum, wealthy foreigners of Indian ethnicity can purchase the status of Overseas Citizen of India. The country’s complex system of quotas and entitlements at once privileges and stigmatizes the poor, members of lower castes, and tribal populations.

Of the five states in the region that emerged from the collapse of the Soviet Union, four have joined China and Russia in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, acceded to China’s demand to rein in their Uighur diasporas so that they cannot coordinate with Uighurs in western China to push for greater autonomy, and expanded their economic ties with China. But Laruelle and Peyrouse’s travels in the region revealed that these states view the SCO as marginal to their main security worries, such as local insurgencies and instability in Afghanistan. They distrust China’s reliability on border security and view their economic relationships with China as unequal. Many of their intellectuals think that China is mishandling the Uighur problem and that instability in China could spill over and affect their countries.

He reveals the cost of what he calls a policy of “calculated terror and systematic violence.” This is the second book in his projected People’s Trilogy series, which aims to expose the impact of Maoism on ordinary people. Dikotter is a pioneering Western user of Chinese provincial archives, and given China’s vast size and social complexity, his project is opening up a vast, comprehensive panorama of suffering. To carry out land reform in poor villages where there were no landlords, the poor attacked one another, and the losers’ meager possessions were redistributed. Revolutionary authorities executed alleged counterrevolutionaries to fulfill quotas. Excessive grain requisitions by the government drove many peasants to starvation. In the cities, old housing was destroyed, and people were rushed into new buildings that were badly constructed and inadequate for their needs. By using the unexpurgated versions of Mao’s orders contained in the provincial archives, Dikotter traces the blame for these outrages directly to Mao.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

It covers the international context, the war on the ground, and controversies over germ warfare and prisoners of war. Although the story of atrocities committed by North Korean and Chinese troops has been told many times before, Jager gives equal attention to lesser-known atrocities perpetrated by U.S. and other allied troops and even by South Korean troops against their own people. She argues that the bitterness of the conflict helped harden Cold War antagonisms in Asia. The war was interrupted by an armistice in 1953 but has not formally ended. The second half of the book traces the history of North-South competition for the “mantle of Korean legitimacy” up to the present. After starting out in the weaker position, South Korea seems to have won the struggle, leading Jager to wonder whether North Korea’s only way out is to become an economic dependent of China -- specifically, a virtual “fourth province” of northeastern China."
25,The Logic and Limits of Political Reform in China,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2013-10-21/logic-and-limits-political-reform-china,The Logic and Limits of Political Reform in China,"In recent years, grass-roots political reforms in China have drawn much hopeful attention in the West. Some townships have held elections for government leaders, a number of cities have opened their budgets to public scrutiny, and in the prosperous city of Wenzhou, the government has allowed associations of private businesses to advise it on policy. But Fewsmith’s careful analyses of roughly a dozen such experiments show that none was democratic in the Western sense. Although varying in form, they have all involved local elites, but not the general public; they have delegated influence over only a narrow range of decisions; and they have avoided mobilization around real conflicts of interest. Some reforms were designed to help the Communist Party recover a measure of prestige in the aftermath of corruption scandals; others, to promote the careers of the officials who sponsored them. Power over local affairs has remained vested in bureaucracies at higher levels, and the party’s secretive Organization Department has retained control over officials’ careers. As innovative officials moved on to new jobs, their efforts were revealed as nothing more than displays of “authoritarian consultation.”Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

Their authority grows partly out of the federal constitution, but more substantially, it is the result of the takeover since the 1990s of many state governments by political parties that are rooted in local ethnolinguistic communities and that owe little loyalty to New Delhi. As an example, Bose explores West Bengal, where the long-ruling Left Front coalition built a political machine dependent on landless rural voters, until it was supplanted by a local breakaway faction of the Indian National Congress. He also looks at two communities that are profoundly alienated from the political system: Kashmiri Muslims, who have conducted a long-running rebellion in the face of brutal repression, and tribal groups living in a band of forested districts in the east, where a Maoist (or Naxalite) insurgency has smoldered for decades. The willingness of most Indians to commit to multiple social identities has produced a distinctive form of democratic politics. In revealing both the violence and the vitality of India’s democracy, Bose sees the country’s future prosperity and stability as anything but assured.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

Woertz begins in the 1970s, when the Arab-led oil embargo pushed up prices and elicited Western threats to withhold their food exports in retaliatory “food wars.” The oil-rich Arab states responded by investing in agricultural production elsewhere, primarily Sudan. Those projects eventually came to naught, although Saudi Arabia ultimately became a net exporter of wheat owing to generous state subsidies (and at the expense of the country’s meager ground-water resources). In 2008, agricultural prices surged in the wake of the financial crisis, rekindling concerns about food security in the region. Food importers began to search again for reliable partners in developing countries with unexploited capacity and low productivity. But poor infrastructure, political instability, and red tape discouraged Arab investors from backing projects in countries such as Ethiopia and Pakistan.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

U.S. policy should focus more on responding to the needs of moderates in Middle Eastern societies and on promoting education, private investment, and public-private ventures that foster innovation, he argues. This is hardly the first book to call for a major recasting of U.S. policy toward the Middle East. But Rohde raises some big structural questions: What determines and sustains U.S. policy in the region? Is it realistic to expect dysfunctional public bureaucracies to foster private innovation? Why do some private actors act as parasites on public budgets, while others, such as the technologists that Rohde admires, innovate and create wealth? Rohde does not address such questions fully enough, making it difficult to evaluate his proposed paradigm shifts."

His findings sometimes reflect significant differences in the opinions in these countries but more often demonstrate basic commonalities. At a time when some pundits see crises in Syria and elsewhere leading to the marginalization of the Arab-Israeli conflict in the region’s politics, Telhami forcefully pulls readers back to it, labeling it a “prism of pain” through which Arab publics view the region -- even if their leaders do not. Arabs overwhelmingly view Israel and the United States as the greatest threats they face. This produces inconsistent preferences: manifested, for example, in their pushing for the establishment of democratic institutions in their own countries while admiring antidemocratic leaders who defy the United States, such as former Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Telhami argues that no U.S. president will make a dent in Arab anti-Americanism so long as Washington maintains its uncritical support for Israel and continues to deploy significant U.S. military forces in the region.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

Wickham has studied the group for 20 years and has interviewed virtually all its leaders. She focuses on the current period, dating back to the 1980s, when Brotherhood members began participating in Egyptian parliamentary elections and organizing student and professional associations. She explores how engagement with the broader body politic has affected the values of individual Brothers and the organization as a whole, a topic that gained salience this summer, when the Egyptian military ousted Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi, a former Brotherhood leader, and launched a violent crackdown on the group. Wickham’s account predates those developments but nonetheless presages such events. Although she suggests that participation in politics leads to moderation among Islamists, one could just as easily find evidence in the Egyptian experience that state repression has the same effect. In fact, the history of Islamist groups in places such as Morocco, Syria, and Turkey also indicates that repression leads to moderation, as Islamists adopt a self-denying principle of avoiding political victories that might panic their adversaries."

Byman emphasizes that U.S. drone strikes have decimated al Qaeda’s senior leadership; Cronin, that they have galvanized extremist recruiting and soured foreign public opinion of the United States. Both points are undoubtedly true, and to argue otherwise in either case would be to deny the basic realities of U.S. drone warfare. Both authors neglect to mention, however, that the use of drone strikes needs to be tempered by the domestic political realities in the countries where they are carried out. Only then can drone warfare achieve the benefits outlined by Byman while minimizing the drawbacks explained by Cronin."

Their critical roles protected them whenever they strayed. Lev Landau, one of the most brilliant scientists in the set, doomed himself to a year in the secret police’s prisons by signing a pamphlet that called Stalin a fascist. But his fate would have been far worse if not for the fact that his superior, Pyotr Kapitsa, intervened on his behalf and persuaded the authorities to release him. Kapitsa headed the critical Institute of Physical Problems, which Stalin had created specifically for Kapitsa in 1934, after refusing to let the physicist return to the United Kingdom, where, since 1921, he had flourished as a researcher. Hargittai, a distinguished Hungarian chemist, relates 12 compact biographies of scientific giants such as Igor Tamm, Andrei Sakharov, Nikolai Semenov, and Yuli Khariton, some of whom he knew personally. His mosaic of a book conveys well the triumphs, tensions, and twists of fortune in this rarified corner of Soviet life.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

But that association overlooks the remarkable alternative forms taken by the idea of a Jewish state. At the turn of the century, many young Jewish intellectuals considered the idea of a homeland in Palestine impractical and unnecessary. They were instead animated by a vision of an autonomous Jewish state within a democratic, multiethnic, and (for many) socialist Russia and eastern Europe. Karlip, with skill and clarity, navigates the many cross-currents and links between Zionism and “diaspora nationalism” and its cultural companion, Yiddishism. He examines and compares the two ideologies’ cultural and political aspects, the fluctuating role of socialist ideals in each, and, in particular, their struggles to reconcile old and new Jewishness and classical Judaism with contemporary European culture. The result is a substantial enrichment of Russian, eastern European, and Jewish history. Karlip uses the lives of three seminal figures -- Yisroel Efroikin, Zelig Kalmanovitch, and Elias Tcherikower -- to tell the story of the movement’s early idealism, inspired in part by the 1905 Russian Revolution, through its decay in the wake of World War I and the Holocaust.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

Farkas was born in Hungary in 1925, trained as a lawyer, and left the country as part of the post-1956 exodus, ending up as a library director in a small community in upstate New York. As the relatively privileged son of landlords, he spent his youth like many boys of his age and social class: playing imaginary games, biking, chasing girls, and struggling with school. But what makes his account interesting is the incredible detail with which he relates events, down to the food served, the songs played, and the jokes told at parties. Hardship arrived with World War II, when he and his classmates were conscripted into a labor battalion to dig defensive trenches in Transylvania. Their lives were upended again with the coming of communism, and once more when the Soviets quickly crushed the momentary hope inspired by the Hungarian revolt of 1956.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

Savodnik follows him from his early days, narrating his youthful dabbling in Marxism and his stint in the U.S. Marine Corps, where, not yet out of his teens, he was already planning to flee to the Soviet Union. He arrived there in 1959, unwanted by the Soviets and filled with half-baked ideas about communism. The authorities shunted him off to Belarus, where a wary KGB could keep an eye on him. Oswald tried to fit in, failed, soured on Soviet life, and asked for the U.S. embassy to give him back his passport less than two years after turning it over. Savodnik recounts almost month by month Oswald’s life in Minsk: his work, friends, conversations, and romances, thanks in part to intensive interviews with those who knew him or “handled” him. His firm and convincing conclusion is that Oswald acted alone when he later killed U.S. President John F. Kennedy and acted not out of animus toward Kennedy or even a misbegotten ideological impulse but rather to effect the early culmination of a life for which Oswald could find no resolution.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

In the early years of the Soviet era, vigorous outdoor activity held sway as a restorative and as a repudiation of the pleasure-filled, hotel-bound vacations favored in the West. Gradually, the regime made room for health sanatoriums and vacation travel, although still guided by “scientifically planned and purposeful activities.” Ironically, these changes began in 1927, on the eve of Stalin’s brutal collectivization of agriculture and first five-year plans. Koenker, with discriminating thoroughness, traces the evolution of Soviet vacationing from that point through the mid-1980s. Over time, Stalinist holidays of fitness and patriotism for the new proletariat gave way to a different model for a different set of beneficiaries, drawn from the Communist Party and bureaucratic elite. By the late 1960s, Soviet vacationers had become less objects of the system and more consumers with a taste for “variety, comfort, service, and family vacations.” This is well-told history, a portrait of life in the Soviet Union that will be recognizable to those who lived it.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

First, it is not quite a biography or an explanation of the man but rather a history of how he and those who surround him built the system that has guided Russia for the last 13 years -- and now misguides it, Judah argues. Second, in laying out the dysfunctions of a centralized but weak state, an all-powerful but corrupt bureaucracy, and an alienated but impotent society, Judah illustrates his case in particularly dispiriting detail, from the machinations on high to the grubby politics below, from the venal battles in Moscow to the empty despair in godforsaken corners of the hinterlands. Finally, he gathers much of his material from telling interviews with a wide range of sources -- opposition leaders, fallen oligarchs, and even dissolute teenagers in villages on Russia’s Chinese border -- and weaves them together with a fine selection of secondary sources.

38,King of Cuba,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2013-10-21/king-cuba,King of Cuba,"The Cuban American novelist García tries her hand at political fiction, with only partial success. Neither pro-Castro Cubans nor the Miami exile community will be pleased with her portrayals of their aging archetypal macho men. In García’s imagination, the “King of Cuba,” an 89-year-old dictator modeled on Fidel Castro, is a narcissistic, manipulative, cruel tyrant: in one scene, he tempts prisoners on a hunger strike with an elaborate banquet. His mirror-image antagonist, in exile in Miami, is equally unappealing: bitter and obsessive, he fantasizes about killing the tyrant and practices his gun skills at a shooting range. Among their shared traits, the two old men fondly recall their numerous sexual exploits, and both struggle vainly against the betrayal of their youthful dreams and the depredations of their aging bodies. García can be devilishly witty and entertaining, but other Latin American authors have produced more finely drawn images of the fading caudillo. Another disappointment is that García’s portrait of a stagnant, sinking Cuba, gripped by political unrest, underplays the more hopeful present reality.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

In this book, he produces a remarkably rich, gritty account of daily life today in the twilight of Caribbean socialism. Working around a cloistered political system, Frank has cultivated uniquely extensive networks of sources, official and private, that serve him scoops on everything from sugar production to anticorruption trials. He is sympathetic to the revolution’s goals but remains cold-eyed in his assessments of the government’s actions. The principal contribution of Cuban Revelations is its detailed coverage of the country’s recent pro-market economic reforms, of President Raúl Castro’s breaking of 50-year-old ideological taboos, and of how ordinary Cubans have perceived these dramatic changes. Among other insights, Frank lists 15 reasons why the unrest sweeping the Arab world is unlikely to reach Cuba, including the fact that in Cuba, “You are allowed to drink, party, and have sex out of wedlock.” Drawing on his exclusive access to unpublished public opinion surveys produced by the government, Frank reasons that most Cubans are now in a “gray zone”: passive bystanders, restless for change. Castro, with his reforms, is working hard to win them back."

He appears fundamentally sympathetic to the church’s doctrines and faith and adopts a middle-of-the-road position on the institutional church’s responses to political and social challenges. He criticizes orthodox bishops who became too close to reactionary elites, condemning the church’s record on slavery as “riddled with inconsistency, evasion, and prevarication.” But he also criticizes radical liberation theologians for blurring the distinction between Catholicism and Marxism, and he expresses contempt for Fidel Castro, who repressed the Catholic Church while tolerating syncretic Afro-Cuban religious practices. Lynch prefers moderate reformers, such as those who spoke out against the genocide of the Spanish conquest, even as he recognizes their frequent ineffectiveness during periods of polarization. In more recent times, Lynch finds value in the activist responses of church leaders in Brazil and Chile to military repression while expressing disappointment in the complicity of their Argentine counterparts. He concludes that although “tradition confronts modernity, authority and liberty in the Church have remained indivisible, each a restraint on excess in the other.”Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

Oddly, the editors have ignored Cuba, whose revolution emphasized these latter categories of rights. Understandably, they dwell on Chile, the birthplace of the contemporary Latin American human rights movement. Essays by Hite and Elizabeth Lira focus on the rights of Chilean victims of state violence and the role of memory in justice, healing, and reconciliation. A superb chapter by Alexander Wilde compares the track records of Chile and Colombia in honoring basic human rights. Other well-informed essays consider the peace-versus-justice debates, the power of civil society to advance rights, and the strengths and shortcomings of the United Nations and the institutions of the inter-American system.

During the Renaissance, parts of the Italian peninsula were among Europe’s richest regions, yet the country stagnated from then until well after unification was completed, in 1870. In the early twentieth century, growth picked up, only to be dampened by war, global depression, and fascist mismanagement. After World War II, Italy unexpectedly became western Europe’s fastest-growing economy and second-largest exporter. Yet over the past decade, it has again suffered a severe setback, which these authors attribute to large budget deficits, poor adjustment to globalization by big firms, low investment in education and research, perverse wage demands, and the crushing effect of the euro on competitiveness. As one might expect from research sponsored by Italy’s central bank, the book downplays that final factor perhaps more than the detailed evidence warrants.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

Steinberg, a German analyst, presents a perspective very different from that held by most Americans. His basic argument is that the recent focus of Islamist terrorists on U.S. and European targets -- rather than, say, Saudi Arabian and Egyptian ones -- is a response to Western overreaction to 9/11. The idea of a global struggle waged against the “far enemy” was a minority view within jihadist movements until the United States launched its invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq. One piece of evidence Steinberg points to is that in Europe, most jihadist attacks have targeted countries that participated in those U.S.-led wars, such as Germany, Spain, and the United Kingdom. This well-documented alternative view is widely held in Europe and deserves serious attention in the United States, as well.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

She is now headed for a rare third term as the leader of a global economic powerhouse. More than anyone else, she holds the future of the eurozone in her hands. Yet she remains a divisive and enigmatic figure. Crawford and Czuczka’s book, the best biography of Merkel in English, gives readers the facts yet fails to penetrate far into the personality of an intensely private politician whose leadership style is blandly methodical. Despite the book’s thin sourcing and repetitive style, the reader does get a strong sense of Merkel’s slow but steady approach to governing and her intense commitment to European integration as a means to tame financial markets -- elements often overlooked in analyses of the euro crisis. To judge from Crawford and Czuczka’s book, Merkel just might triumph in the end."

His insightful overview of Europe’s historical evolution is livened by occasionally revealing anecdotes of behind-the-scenes political intrigue. Yet in the end, he finds it difficult to transcend the same technocratic prescriptions for an “ever-closer union” that have led Europe into its current impasse. He suggests that diplomats, lawyers, bureaucrats, and politicians deepen their cooperation across borders and impose centralized democratic practices on Europe from the top down. But he does not closely analyze the economic incentives, financial pressures, monetary reforms, public support, or partisan coalitions that would be required to make those solutions work, and he fails to adequately answer the critical question facing the continent today: How much integration do Europeans really want?Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

Greek politicians, they argue, can act more freely and effectively than many observers realize. Yet the country has been bogged down by two decades of poorly designed and badly executed institutional change, based more on special interest job creation and regulation than on fair-minded redistribution.

In the most entertaining and depressing book about the U.S. political system published in many years, Leibovich lets readers peep behind the curtain and see what goes on in the greenrooms and at the parties of the Washington elite. He reveals an ugly spectacle: tribunes of the people transform into corporate shills, money makes the world go round, and insecure arrivistes stroke one another’s egos as they bathe in a flowing river of narcissism. It turns out that contrary to the prevalent fears of political polarization, this is a golden age of bipartisanship. Not much happens on the floor of Congress, of course, but when it comes to doing favors for friends, Washington is enjoying a new Era of Good Feelings, in which politicians help their colleagues score regardless of their party affiliation. The Chinese Communist Party once ordered its cadres to read The Ancien Régime and the Revolution, Alexis de Tocqueville’s account of how the failings of the old elite paved the way for the French Revolution. But today’s Washington elite is probably too busy imitating the benighted creatures of Versailles to learn anything useful from their fate."

Ideas, examples, anecdotes, speculations, and assertions fly thick and fast, leaving the reader exhausted. Cyberwar, democratization and the Internet, the effects of 3-D printing on transportation networks, the future of education and arms control: there is hardly a subject that escapes the authors’ attention. But many of the topics Schmidt and Cohen treat in passing are so complicated (and so important) that the book sometimes seems superficial and glib.

49,Presidential Leadership and the Creation of the American Era,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2013-10-21/presidential-leadership-and-creation-american-era,Presidential Leadership and the Creation of the American Era,"In this short, tightly focused, and useful book, Nye takes on one of the great myths of modern presidential scholarship. Many political scientists divide U.S. presidents into “transactional leaders,” who have relatively modest goals, and “transformational leaders,” who set out to recast U.S. institutions and political ideas. Political scientists and media commentators tend to swoon over the transformational leaders. Nye, in contrast, makes a compelling case that transactional leaders, such as Dwight Eisenhower and George H. W. Bush, often get more done than swaggering high rollers, such as Theodore Roosevelt and George W. Bush. It is, however, hard to conclude from the evidence he presents that one style is inherently better than the other. For example, Nye rightly notes that Roosevelt’s global diplomacy left few traces in U.S. politics, but that was less because Roosevelt’s actions were wrong than because Roosevelt was too far ahead of public opinion: in the early twentieth century, the United States would have been better off if more Americans had understood the dangers brewing in Europe, but the gulf between what public opinion would sustain and what the country needed was too wide for any leader to bridge.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."
50,Evangelicals and American Foreign Policy,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2013-10-21/evangelicals-and-american-foreign-policy,Evangelicals and American Foreign Policy,"With the recent emergence on both the left and the right of strong populist opposition to the postwar internationalist consensus, the United States is embroiled in what could be its most searching foreign policy debate since the start of the Cold War. Put on the defensive, liberal internationalists and national security conservatives alike are casting about for new allies as old assumptions and policies come under attack. Amstutz’s book represents a timely intervention, highlighting the ideas and priorities of a politically significant constituency that might provide critical support for those who believe that U.S. security and prosperity still require deep global engagement. Today’s evangelicals combine, on the one hand, global concerns and humanitarian values that resonate with many liberal internationalists and, on the other, pro-market and antistatist inclinations and ideas on sexual morality that diverge from the liberal conventional wisdom. The portrait Amstutz draws of evangelical foreign policy activism and thought does not always flatter his subject; he is frank about some of the theological, intellectual, and institutional challenges that face American evangelicals seeking to influence U.S. policy and world events.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."
51,Moment of Battle; After Thermopylae,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2013-10-21/moment-battle-after-thermopylae,Moment of Battle; After Thermopylae,"In 1851, Sir Edward Creasy published The Fifteen Decisive Battles of the World: From Marathon to Waterloo. This classic work of military history introduced a controversial concept -- that individual military encounters could change the course of history -- and implicitly challenged other military historians to come up with their own lists. Lacey and Murray are the latest to try. They have no doubt that the outcomes of wars can “reverberate down through the ages” and that those outcomes can turn not just on the application of superior resources but also on the quality of generalship. They choose battles that allowed the Western world to take shape, endure, and prevail: the fights of the ancient Greeks against the Persians, the contests that led to the rise of the United Kingdom as a dominant power, four of the critical confrontations of World War II, the French defeat at Dien Bien Phu in 1954, and -- not wholly convincingly -- the U.S. drive to Baghdad in 2003. These choices invite refutation and alternative suggestions, but in the hands of two such accomplished historians, the accounts of the selected battles are models of lucidity."
52,Three New Books on Counterinsurgency,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2013-10-21/three-new-books-counterinsurgency,Three New Books on Counterinsurgency,"Although U.S. forces are now out of Iraq and are quickly withdrawing from Afghanistan, debate still rages over counterinsurgency (COIN) and the concept of “winning hearts and minds.” Fitzgerald’s book is less concerned with the lessons of history than with the history of the lessons, especially those of the Vietnam War. Fitzgerald describes how stories of conflict get told and retold, even while the fighting is still under way, to support shifts in policy and strategy. The U.S. military has always been at best ambivalent about COIN, with a strong preference for recasting every contest in terms that suit more traditional forms of fighting. During the Vietnam War, this preference exasperated COIN enthusiasts, who believed that the war could be won if only the United States were less dependent on search-and-destroy tactics. But as Fitzgerald notes, it is not clear that any strategy could have succeeded given the underlying politics of the Vietnamese civil war. After the war, most U.S. military strategists took the view that the problem lay with COIN theory rather than their own uncertain application of it, and so they returned to their comfort zone of preparing for large-scale wars. This meant that they were totally unprepared for the Iraq war in 2003."

He acknowledges that countries and international institutions deliver development aid for many purposes and that aid can be useful, even necessary. But after a fulsome review of aid giving in recent decades, he argues that most aid, even in its new and allegedly improved forms, has not contributed to economic development or even to the alleviation of poverty. Sometimes, it has even been counterproductive, especially in Africa. Aid agencies and nongovernmental organizations have proliferated, their aid programs overwhelming the administrative capacity of some recipient governments and resulting in high transactions costs and perverse incentives for officials and others. This tends to alienate recipient countries -- an unfortunate outcome, since economic development requires their high motivation and active engagement. The author sees hope in the growing diasporas made up of emigrants from many developing countries, which often provide their home countries with funds, entrepreneurial energy, technical and managerial experience, and marketing knowledge gained abroad. He argues that with help from such emigrants, private foreign investment is more likely than development aid to lead poor countries out of poverty.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

The book offers a useful chronology and a clear exposition, in nontechnical terms, of the origins of the euro crises through 2012. Smaghi argues that most analyses of the eurozone’s problems and most proposed remedies have focused on the symptoms rather than the underlying causes of the crises, which lie in the failure of European democracies -- aging societies in an increasingly youthful, globalized world -- to adapt to fundamental changes at home and abroad. Such adaptation would offend cherished European beliefs and a deeply rooted sense of entitlement to public spending, which politicians, focused on staying in office, are loath to take on. Without being apocalyptic, the author argues that the survival of the euro will require ceding more authority to Europe-wide institutions and to the directly elected European Parliament.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

What might be common practice in one country might be considered unethical or even illegal in another. Indeed, even the laws of one’s home country might prohibit practices that have become common owing to weak or nonexistent law enforcement. In 2005, then UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan asked Ruggie to survey expert opinion on the relationship between foreign corporations (and their suppliers) and violations of human rights in the countries in which they do business, including in places where conflict prevents authorities from governing. The result, as presented in this book, is a set of 31 guiding principles for governments and corporations centered on the slogan “Protect, respect, and remedy.” The book discusses the personal and substantive challenges Ruggie faced in his work, which was endorsed unanimously in 2011 by the UN Human Rights Council. Senior management of all multinational firms should be aware of these principles.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

Internet firms, many of which operate from obscure locations, can now provide services that were once impossible to trade over long distances: take, for example, online gambling, which is against the law in many countries but hosted by companies based in Antigua, a small island nation in the Caribbean. The participation of major Internet companies in the U.S. National Security Agency’s collection of massive quantities of electronic data, provocatively revealed earlier this year by a former contractor for the agency, serves as a reminder that these companies capture oodles of information about their customers -- and about the friends and contacts of their customers -- sometimes in violation of laws protecting personal privacy, especially those in Europe. This interesting book reviews the diverse legal cases that have taken place so far involving such conflicts, including those convened under the General Agreement on Trade in Services of the World Trade Organization. It suggests ways that countries can benefit from the many positive aspects of an open Internet while still preserving democratically determined preferences about what content should be allowed online and what data should remain private.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."
57,Balance: The Economics of Great Powers From Ancient Rome to Modern America,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/balance-economics-great-powers-ancient-rome-modern-america,Balance: The Economics of Great Powers From Ancient Rome to Modern America,"Hubbard and Kane take readers on a rapid romp through imperial history, covering the Roman, Chinese, Spanish, Ottoman, Japanese, and British empires and finding the seeds of their failures in fiscal incontinence and the rise of loss-averse special interest groups. Historians often date the beginnings of imperial declines, identifying them with some external event, usually military in character. The authors argue persuasively that the decay typically starts long before such events and usually originates with some internal change. Against this background, they discuss the looming failures of Europe, the United States, and even California, the world’s tenth-largest economy. Their central thesis is that modern democracies have become dysfunctional and can be rectified only by changing the perverse incentives they create for politicians. (It is worth noting, of course, that their historical examples illustrate that dysfunction is hardly limited to democracies.) To accomplish this improvement in democratic governance, Hubbard and Kane propose eliminating safe electoral seats, abolishing term limits, and imposing tight fiscal rules on budgeting.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."
58,"Water, Peace, and War: Confronting the Global Water Crisis",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2013-10-21/water-peace-and-war-confronting-global-water-crisis,"Water, Peace, and War: Confronting the Global Water Crisis","Chellaney sketches a bleak picture of water scarcity in Africa, Asia, and the Middle East, regions also struggling with unstable governments and rapidly growing populations. What Chellaney calls “water stressed conditions” are also appearing in developed countries, such as Australia, Spain, and South Korea. Even the deep-water aquifers that support modern agriculture in North America are dwindling. But will the social and environmental stresses of water shortage lead to conflict and armed violence? On that question, Chellaney’s book is more speculative. Conflicts over water have already embroiled states along the Nile basin, in Africa, and along the Tigris-Euphrates basin, in the Middle East, and the war in Darfur has at least partly been driven by clashes over access to water in Sudan’s far west. Chellaney makes it clear that such conflicts will become more common as water begins to be “used as a weapon,” as a recent U.S. intelligence assessment predicted, at least in a metaphoric sense, as upstream countries deny water to downstream ones. But water scarcity seems less likely to spark resource wars than to more broadly contribute to the general deterioration of social and environmental life on the planet.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."
59,Exodus: How Migration Is Changing Our World,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2013-10-21/exodus-how-migration-changing-our-world,Exodus: How Migration Is Changing Our World,"Collier is best known for his writings on “the bottom billion,” the world’s poorest people. In this book, he explores the economics and politics of global migration and offers a surprising and controversial case for restricting it. Owing to the global growth of economic inequality, huge numbers of people in poor countries are eager to leave their difficult conditions in search of better lives elsewhere. Although migrants often manage to improve their own lots, Collier argues that the countries they leave behind and the countries that receive them might actually become worse off. He acknowledges the economic benefits receiving countries enjoy from immigration but believes that after a certain point, these benefits are outweighed by the social costs generated by a decline in “mutual regard”: that is, the trust and social cohesion necessary for a well-functioning society. For the countries the migrants leave behind, Collier also sees losses, associated with the brain drain and weakened national identity. Collier wisely limits himself to cautious and hedged arguments, because, as he himself warns, debates about restrictions on immigration can quickly get tangled up with the politics of racism.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."
60,Democratic Futures: Revisioning Democracy Promotion,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2013-10-21/democratic-futures-revisioning-democracy-promotion,Democratic Futures: Revisioning Democracy Promotion,"This book provides a useful contribution to debates about democracy promotion by looking at what Kurki deems the “hidden” assumptions about political change that inform discussions of the topic. Kurki brings a rather cumbersome critical-theory approach to her inquiry. But it does yield interesting insights into the evolution of ideas about how to promote democracy. Kurki believes U.S. policy thinkers limit themselves by backing a narrow, procedural democratic model tied to elections and laissez-faire capitalism, blinding themselves to alternative models such as those based on European social democratic liberalism and the World Bank’s technocratic neoliberalism. But generally, Kurki finds that in recent years, Western thinking on democracy has become less triumphalist and less dependent on one-size-fits-all visions. She seems surprised to find that a growing contestation of ideas has roiled the democracy-promotion establishment. But the book itself is an innovative contribution to that debate.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."
61,Making Human Rights a Reality,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/making-human-rights-reality,Making Human Rights a Reality,"Over the last 60 years, the international community has constructed a global human rights system, embodied in an expanding array of principles, declarations, treaties, courts, and transnationally organized lawyers and activists. Yet as Hafner-Burton makes clear in this important book, the system’s aspirations have far outstripped its ability to enforce international law and protect norms. Hafner-Burton argues that what is needed is not more international law but targeted strategic actions by advanced democracies -- the so-called stewardship states -- to curb the worst abuses. The book acknowledges that international laws and norms have had an impact, but mainly in stable and developed societies or in countries making transitions to democracy. Unfortunately, the people most at risk live elsewhere, in small, poor, and war-torn countries where appeals to moral or legal principles have little effect. The book argues that fighting systematic human rights abuse requires a strategy of localization, in which outside groups work with domestic counterparts to promote education and the training of military and police forces. Hafner-Burton’s sober message is that human rights promotion cannot be separated from the daunting task of building stable, rule-based societies.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."
62,The Sea and Civilization: A Maritime History of the World,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2013-10-21/sea-and-civilization-maritime-history-world,The Sea and Civilization: A Maritime History of the World,"In the Western imagination, seafaring began to influence the course of world history with the European discovery of the New World. During the “classic age of sail,” spanning the fifteenth through the eighteenth centuries, the Western powers undertook their great voyages of discovery, linking distant regions and establishing European global supremacy. In this fascinating and beautifully written scholarly work, Paine steps back from this Eurocentric view to tell the story of maritime travel through the entire sweep of human history. For thousands of years, people have been launching themselves onto water to fish, trade, fight, and explore -- and doing so in ways that have profoundly shaped human institutions and the rise and decline of civilizations. The narrative is more encyclopedic than thematic; Paine does not advance any explicit claims about the relationship between maritime power and world affairs. Nonetheless, with its richness of detail, the book does offer an eloquent vision of how the sea served as a path to the modern world.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

Even those supporting the cuts stress the need to avoid the supposedly awful consequences of past retrenchments. “We have to remember the lessons of history,” President Barack Obama said in January 2012. “We can’t afford to repeat the mistakes that have been made in the past -- after World War II, after Vietnam -- when our military policy was left ill prepared for the future. As commander in chief, I will not let that happen again.” Similarly, then Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta told Congress in October 2011, “After every major conflict -- World War I, World War II, Korea, Vietnam, the fall of the Soviet Union -- what happened was that we ultimately hollowed out the force. Whatever we do in confronting the challenges we face now on the fiscal side, we must not make that mistake.”"

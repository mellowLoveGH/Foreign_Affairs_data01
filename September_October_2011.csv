Vaïsse, a foreign policy analyst at the Brookings Institution, and Kundnani, a former journalist working for the European Council on Foreign Relations, assembled a team of researchers in an effort to get beyond such “glass half empty or half full” debates. They assign numerical ratings to the annual performance of EU foreign policy and intend to update them every year. The strength of the exercise lies in the details: 80 separate issues are rated on the extent to which EU member states agree on a policy, the resources committed to the issue, and the outcome. Its weakness lies in the media-friendly aggregation of scores into a single number and a letter grade (A to F) for each issue. This oversimplifies. Is unity is a component of success, or are some issues better handled by a vanguard of leading countries? Does grading Europe down for failing to devote massive resources and political will to difficult areas with nearly intractable tradeoffs, such as climate change or Chinese human rights, simply penalize politicians for setting sensible priorities? Readers should ignore the grades and focus on the subtler virtues of this pioneering experiment in foreign policy analysis.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."
1,Commanding Democracy in Egypt,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/north-africa/2011-09-01/commanding-democracy-egypt,Commanding Democracy in Egypt,"Many of the iconic images from Egypt's revolution depict the Egyptian military supporting the uprising in Tahrir Square. As soldiers joined demonstrators and allowed them to scrawl ""Mubarak Leave"" on the sides of their tanks, the protesters became convinced that the military would protect the revolution and move Egypt toward democracy. The Egyptian army's top commanders pledged to do just that. The day after Hosni Mubarak fell, the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (SCAF), the military body now governing the country, vowed to ""ensure a peaceful transition of authority within a free and democratic system that allows an elected civilian authority to take charge of governing the country."" Yet the SCAF's attempts to curtail dissent and the democratic process have fueled doubts about its true intentions. Will the military fulfill its promise to support democracy? Or will it seek to replace Mubarak's rule with its own or that of a friendly autocrat?"
2,"Invading Afghanistan, Then and Now",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/review-essay/2011-08-19/invading-afghanistan-then-and-now,"Invading Afghanistan, Then and Now","""As the result of two successful campaigns, of the employment of an enormous force, and of the expenditures of large sums of money,"" the secretary of state observed, ""all that has yet been accomplished has been the disintegration of the State . . . and a condition of anarchy throughout the remainder of the country."" A highly decorated general, recently returned from service in Kandahar, concluded, ""I feel sure that I am right when I say that the less the Afghans see of us the less they will dislike us."" The politician was Spencer Cavendish, Marquis of Hartington, the British secretary of state for India. The general was Sir Frederick Roberts, who eventually became a field marshal and the subject of three ballads by Rudyard Kipling. The year was 1880. As U.S. President Barack Obama tries to wind down the longest war in U.S. history, while leaving behind some measure of stability, he would be wise to keep in mind this bitter truth: most of Afghanistan's would-be conquerors make the same mistakes, and most eventually meet the same disastrous fate."
3,Tokyo's Transformation,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/japan/2011-08-19/tokyos-transformation,Tokyo’s Transformation,"The earthquake and tsunami that struck northeastern Japan on March 11, 2011, caused almost unimaginable damage and misery. In a surge of floodwater that lasted just two minutes, Japan lost nearly as many people as a proportion of its population as the United States did during the entire Vietnam War. The subsequent meltdown of the Fukushima nuclear reactors deepened the crisis."
4,The Unbreakable Muslim Brotherhood,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/north-africa/2011-09-01/unbreakable-muslim-brotherhood,The Unbreakable Muslim Brotherhood,"The protesters who led Egypt's revolt last January were young, liberal, and linked-in. They were the bloggers who first proposed the demonstrations against Hosni Mubarak on Twitter; the Facebook-based activists who invited their ""friends"" to protest; and Wael Ghonim, the 30-year-old Google executive who, after Egypt's state security agency detained him for 12 days, rallied the crowds to hold Tahrir Square. Far from emulating Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, they channeled Thomas Paine, calling for civil liberties, religious equality, and an end to Mubarak's dictatorship. Their determination, punctuated by the speed of their triumph, fueled optimism that the long-awaited Arab Spring had finally sprung -- that the Middle East would no longer be an autocratic exception in an increasingly democratic world."
5,Palestine Goes to the UN,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/middle-east/2011-08-19/palestine-goes-un,Palestine Goes to the UN,"Mahmoud Abbas, the president of the Palestinian Authority (PA) and chair of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), plans to call on the United Nations in September to recognize a Palestinian state and admit it as a full member of the organization. This strategy marks a dramatic shift in the Palestinians' approach to the conflict with Israel: they are not seeking to revive the moribund peace process; they are seeking to bypass it altogether."
6,The Middling Kingdom,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2011-08-19/middling-kingdom,The Middling Kingdom,"By any measure, China's economic growth has been unprecedented, even miraculous. According to the International Monetary Fund, the Chinese economy grew by an average of 9.6 percent per year between 1990 and 2010. At the beginning of the recent global financial crisis, many feared that the Chinese growth engine would grind to a halt. In late 2008, Chinese exports collapsed, triggering fears of political instability and popular revolt in the country. In the end, however, the global economic crisis turned out to be little more than a pothole on the road of China's economic growth. Inflationary pressures may now be building up in China, and China's property bubble may be threatening to burst, but most economists continue to predict rapid growth for the country well into the future. Although their forecasts vary widely, they seem to share the view that China's growth will be fast—if not as fast as it has been—and that this rate of growth will continue for decades. These predictions are at once cautious about the near future (China's performance will not be as extraordinary as it has been) and optimistic about the distant future (they see no end to China's upward trajectory). By coincidence or design, they are moderated extrapolations of current trends."
7,The Inevitable Superpower,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2011-08-19/inevitable-superpower,The Inevitable Superpower,"To debtors, creditors can be like dictators. Governments in financial trouble often turn to the International Monetary Fund as supplicants, and acting at the behest of its own major creditors, the IMF often imposes tough conditions on them. After the Asian financial crisis of the late 1990s, Mickey Kantor, U.S. trade representative under President Bill Clinton, called the organization ""a battering ram,"" because it had served to open up Asian markets to U.S. products. During the 1956 Suez crisis, the United States threatened to withhold financing that the United Kingdom desperately needed unless British forces withdrew from the Suez Canal. Harold Macmillan, who, as the British chancellor of the exchequer, presided over the last, humiliating stages of the crisis, would later recall that it was ""the last gasp of a declining power."" He added, ""perhaps in 200 years the United States would know how we felt."""
8,Afghanistan's Ethnic Puzzle,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/afghanistan/2011-08-19/afghanistans-ethnic-puzzle,Afghanistan’s Ethnic Puzzle,"In late 2001,when U.S. forces expelled the Taliban from Afghanistan, the country appeared headed for a breakup. The United States and the rest of the international community feared that Afghanistan's rival ethnic groups would use their regional power bases to pull apart any unitary state, forming in its place independent ministates or aligning with their ethnic brethren across Afghanistan's borders. At the time, such fears seemed credible: NATO troops were still dealing with the fallout from the violent disintegration of the former Yugoslavia in the 1990s."
9,Leaving Afghanistan to the Afghans,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/afghanistan/2011-08-19/leaving-afghanistan-afghans,Leaving Afghanistan to the Afghans,"In the summer of 2011, I visited the Afghan army's Regional Military Training Center in Helmand Province. The recruits had been there for two weeks, and they looked as strong as any group of U.S. soldiers in basic training. The Afghan drill instructors were as competent, and had the same cocky swagger, as American ones. ""Sir, look at all of our volunteers,"" one drill sergeant proudly said to me. ""They're great. We have already won. . . . We just don't know it yet."""
10,September 11 in Retrospect,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/united-states/september-11-retrospect,September 11 in Retrospect,"Ten years after 9/11, we can begin to gain some perspective on the impact of that day's terrorist attacks on U.S. foreign policy. There was, and there remains, a natural tendency to say that the attacks changed everything. But a decade on, such conclusions seem unjustified. September 11 did alter the focus and foreign policy of the George W. Bush administration. But the administration's new approach, one that garnered so much praise and so much criticism, was less transformative than contemporaries thought. Much of it was consistent with long-term trends in U.S. foreign policy, and much has been continued by President Barack Obama. Some aspects merit the scorn often heaped on them; other aspects merit praise that was only grudging in the moment. Wherever one positions oneself, it is time to place the era in context and assess it as judiciously as possible."
11,Will Oil Drown the Arab Spring?,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/middle-east/2011-08-19/will-oil-drown-arab-spring,Will Oil Drown the Arab Spring?,"Even before this year's Arab uprisings, the Middle East was not an undifferentiated block of authoritarianism. The citizens of countries with little or no oil, such as Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, and Tunisia, generally had more freedom than those of countries with lots of it, such as Bahrain, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, and Saudi Arabia. And once the tumult started, the oil-rich regimes were more effective at fending off attempts to unseat them. Indeed, the Arab Spring has seriously threatened just one oil-funded ruler -- Libya's Muammar al-Qaddafi -- and only because NATO's intervention prevented the rebels' certain defeat."
12,Nigeria: Dancing on the Brink,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2011-09-01/nigeria-dancing-brink,Nigeria: Dancing on the Brink,"Part diplomatic memoir, part layman’s introduction to the country, Campbell’s book provides an excellent snapshot of Nigeria today. Campbell recounts key events in the country during his terms there as an American diplomat, including a spell as U.S. ambassador from 2004 to 2007. On several occasions, Campbell comments on U.S. timidity, notably Washington’s hesitancy to publicly voice its concerns about Nigeria’s deplorable levels of corruption or about the fraud and violence that have marred recent elections. Thankfully, in retirement, Campbell has none of this diplomatic reticence, and his book is a lively and sometimes highly critical analysis of the country’s political class, which is usually more interested in lining its pockets than in responding to the needs and aspirations of Nigerians. Campbell also draws a keenly observed portrait of recent elite politics, ending with President Umaru Yar’Adua’s death in 2010 and the emergence of the current head of state, Goodluck Jonathan.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."
13,A Predictable Tragedy: Robert Mugabe and the Collapse of Zimbabwe,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2011-09-01/predictable-tragedy-robert-mugabe-and-collapse-zimbabwe,A Predictable Tragedy: Robert Mugabe and the Collapse of Zimbabwe,"At Zimbabwe’s independence in 1980, the country’s future seemed rosy, with a vibrant agricultural export sector, sub-Saharan Africa’s highest literacy rate, and an impressive new president, Robert Mugabe, who seemed to genuinely desire reconciliation with the white minority he had fought as a Marxist guerrilla leader. When the present crisis began to unfold in the late 1990s, some observers wondered why Mugabe had changed. Compagnon’s devastating analysis of the regime argues that the country’s collapse was in fact the predictable outcome of the methods and approach Mugabe has always followed. Organized violence against political enemies has been part of the arsenal of his political party, ZANU-PF, since the early stages of the independence struggle. Likewise, Zimbabwe’s recent economic collapse was the inevitable result of three decades of crony capitalism and outright corruption. An excellent chapter on the land expropriations of white farmers carefully deconstructs the regime’s rhetoric and methods, arguing that the violent abuses in the process were never random but rather the result of Mugabe’s political calculations. In its detailed knowledge of the country and accumulated evidence, Compagnon’s book stands out as the best account of the crisis to date.

In his informative history of the seven cholera pandemics that have hit the continent since 1817, Echenberg shows that this was not always so. Epidemiologists agree that cholera originated in South Asia. Its arrival in Africa at the beginning of the nineteenth century was testimony to the region’s growing insertion into global economic and social systems, as successive pandemics followed trade routes, colonial armies, and African Muslims making pilgrimage to Mecca. Back then, cholera was one of the most devastating diseases known, killing millions. But over time, the virulence of dominant strains of the disease have abated, and mortality rates have dropped sharply, particularly since a highly effective oral rehydration therapy was mastered. Echenberg argues that the 5,000–7,000 cholera deaths every year in Africa represent a failure to provide public sanitation systems and access to clean water, often in failing states that are riven by civil war. Indeed, in 2006, four countries accounted for three-quarters of all cases on the continent: Angola, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, and Sudan.

15,The New Scramble for Africa; Season of Rains: Africa in the World,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2011-09-01/new-scramble-africa-season-rains-africa-world,The New Scramble for Africa; Season of Rains: Africa in the World,"The past decade or so has witnessed the most comprehensive and sustained period of economic growth in Africa since the 1950s. Various factors help explain this, but pride of place probably goes to the much more favorable international prices that have recently prevailed for most of Africa’s commodity exports, thanks in part to the surge in Asia’s purchasing power. In turn, high commodity prices have encouraged foreign direct investment in Africa, particularly in the oil and mining sectors. (Particularly noteworthy is China’s rapidly increasing investment in the region.) These two books try to make sense of all these developments. Carmody’s argues forcefully that the current trends evoke the late-nineteenth-century scramble for Africa, during which a handful of European powers carved up the continent in pursuit of its natural resources, and his book is full of arresting anecdotes and provocative claims about the nature of the competition. Carmody tends to view international economic relations as a zero-sum game, and as a result, he sees the competition for resources by outsiders as bad news for the region."
16,The Impact of China’s 1989 Tiananmen Massacre,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2011-09-01/impact-chinas-1989-tiananmen-massacre,The Impact of China’s 1989 Tiananmen Massacre,"The 14 chapters in this volume provide a sweeping overview of the gains and setbacks in China since the 1989 Tiananmen Square crisis. The fundamental changes have been the shift to a politically circumscribed market economy and the consolidation of the communist regime. This phantasmagoric formation, which Barry Naughton describes in his chapter as a harsh and “elite-dominated form of state capitalism,” has produced two decades of explosive economic growth -- without democratization. The state has instead suppressed the history and memories of the June 4 massacre, strengthened the patriotic education of Chinese youth, expanded the policing of the population, and made little progress toward the rule of law. Chapters on foreign policy argue that Chinese leaders are wielding their newly gained economic power to shape international norms and institutions (such as those concerning human rights) and pressure Western countries and companies for political concessions. These trends have even adversely affected the democracy movement in Hong Kong. The authors trace the origins of these changes to Chinese leaders’ responses to the June 4 crisis and their determination to avert another Tiananmen-style protest. Although a few contributions cover the changing strategies of political and intellectual dissent and new types of citizen activism, by and large the volume offers little hope that China will move toward democracy anytime soon.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

Their research demonstrates the vigor of both national and subnational identities in India and other countries with similar political systems, such as Belgium, Canada, and Spain. The institutions that give political leaders the best chance to promote cohesion include asymmetric federalism (granting different powers to different territorial units), the strong protection of individual rights, and parliamentary government. The authors show how other institutional frameworks that give too little autonomy to territorially concentrated subgroups (as in Sri Lanka) or too much (as in Yugoslavia) tend toward secessionism and civil war. And they argue that U.S.-style federalism should be avoided in all “robustly multinational” societies because of its legislative malapportionment, indivisibility of executive power, and plethora of veto points. Since few countries in the world are homogenous nation-states along the lines of France or Japan, these arguments have broad practical relevance.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

The Cultural Revolution was not just an urban phenomenon, as previously believed. People classified as coming from bad “class backgrounds” were murdered in groups, often whole families at a time, in front of mass meetings. The slaughter was especially intense in Guangdong and Guangxi, southern provinces with histories of clan conflict. The perpetrators were “ordinary men,” anxious to demonstrate their fealty to Mao’s line on class struggle and filled with panic about a supposed counterrevolutionary conspiracy that had in fact been fabricated by the leaders in Beijing. Although the state did not carry out the killings or order them, it created the lawless environment that made them possible. Su tells a heart-rending story and contributes new insights to the burgeoning academic literature on contentious politics and genocide.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

King Abdullah stresses the dominant presence of his father, King Hussein, throughout his life, notes the formative influence of his schooling (Deerfield Academy in the United States and Sandhurst in the United Kingdom), records his many years of soldiering, and provides an insider’s view of the Jordanian royal family (including a circumspect account of King Hussein’s deathbed decision to change the succession from Abdullah’s uncle, Hassan, to him). The narrative is enriched by numerous firsthand accounts and appraisals of other political leaders, including Americans, Israelis, Palestinians, and Iraqis. The book, which went to press before the Arab uprisings, ends with a plea to seize the “last best chance” for an Israeli-Palestinian settlement. The Hashemites of Jordan, long conditioned to ingratiate themselves with or defend themselves against stronger outsiders, are accustomed to explaining themselves to others. It is a family tradition: King Abdullah’s Our Last Best Chance follows King Hussein’s Uneasy Lies the Head (1962), both of which appeared after ten years on the throne."

According to his research of public opinion polls since the 1950s, the public has been consistent: it believes in the use of force for defensive purposes but distrusts the military’s ability to act wisely in the national interest, and it fears entrapment by the U.S. alliance in wars of the United States’ making but favors the use of the military for beneficent missions such as disaster relief. In Japan’s democratic system, public opinion matters. At crucial moments, it has limited the ability of what Midford calls “hawkish elites” to join Washington in Afghanistan and Iraq. Although North Korean belligerence and the rise of China have increased public support for territorial defense, they have not increased support for intervention. The book does not explore variations in attitudes across categories of respondents, which might have provided insight into politically salient cleavages.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

Since the first edition of Cole’s book was published a decade ago, the PLAN has made the transition from a coastal defense organization to a nascent blue-water force. Its signal strengths are its submarines and its antiship cruise missiles, both of which were acquired with an eye to a possible conflict with the United States over Taiwan. The navy is close to fielding one aircraft carrier, presumably the first of many, and has built a large naval base on Hainan Island, which signals Beijing’s commitment to defend its sweeping claims in the South China Sea. All the while, the Communist Party’s top-to-bottom control of the service has remained vigorous. In Cole’s judgment, the PLAN is still far from being able to dominate the U.S., the Japanese, the Indian, or even the South Korean navy. But it already has enough strength to seize the initiative in selected scenarios. As for its future, farther shores beckon, since China depends on sea-lanes that reach all the way to the west coast of Africa. The naval ambitions of political leaders in Beijing are unknown, but there is no end in sight to the PLAN’s development.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

Or are international norms and institutions just a new arena for the old game of realpolitik? Foot and Walter compare U.S. and Chinese compliance with five sets of norms, governing the use of force, mutual surveillance of macroeconomic policy, nuclear nonproliferation, climate change, and global financial flows. With careful attention to detail, the authors are able to show that China’s compliance has increased as its economy has become more interdependent with the rest of the world, although in selective ways that reflect particular economic and security interests. Although the United States created the initial institutions, it has performed inconsistently, unable to rein in important domestic constituencies that have an interest in seeing certain norms violated. In both Beijing and Washington, compliance seems to be strongest when the distribution of its costs and benefits is perceived as fair. But this is a hard equilibrium to achieve, given the asymmetries of power, culture, and development that mark the international system.

The civilian authorities believe in “strategic restraint,” which is too vague a concept to guide military planning. The land forces have configured themselves primarily for a surprise attack against Pakistan that is unlikely to be authorized, while remaining unprepared for the more immediate task of fighting domestic insurgencies. The air force spends more money than its rivals in Pakistan and China yet is falling further behind them. The navy is the highest-quality service and has the largest potential area of operation, but it has not decided which of many possible missions to prioritize. The authors attribute these dysfunctions to a lack of military expertise among government leaders, a failure of coordination among relevant civilian ministries and agencies, and rivalries among the services over missions and money. They trace the roots of these flaws to choices made before and since independence, and they see little prospect for change. If they are right, India is on track to violate the rule that rising affluence brings rising military power.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

He uses them to refine existing theories of alliance politics and coercive diplomacy. One lesson is that weakly coordinated alliances send out mixed signals that court miscalculation by the rival camp, as was the case with the murky U.S. commitment to the defense of South Korea and Taiwan in 1950 and the uncoordinated Soviet and Chinese responses to General Douglas MacArthur’s Inchon landing the same year. Another lesson is that internally divided alliances generate competitive escalation among their members, as was the case in the 1960s with China and Russia, each of which sought to outdo the other in Cuba, Laos, and Vietnam. Even though rivals feel more threatened when an alliance is monolithic, a unified enemy can be easier to deal with than a divided one. Sometimes, a strong alliance system can trigger conflict, as was the case in 1954 when the United States spearheaded the creation of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization. That act motivated Mao to launch artillery attacks in the Taiwan Strait in an attempt to deter the United States from signing a mutual defense treaty with Taiwan. Christensen suggests that in the past decade, during part of which he served in the U.S. government, the United States has made its signaling to Beijing credible by making its commitments to Taipei and Tokyo clear.

The coup de grâce was administered not by the victorious Allies, who were content to leave a truncated Ottoman Empire in place, but by an Ottoman general, Mustafa Kemal, who adopted the richly symbolic title Atatürk (meaning “father of the Turks”). Atatürk does not lack for biographers, most of whose books are adulatory, but none has so thoroughly brought to life the ideological climate that molded the man as has Hanioglu. And few have presented Atatürk with such objectivity. Hanioglu’s Atatürk is a product of Young Turk nationalism, Enlightenment secularism, and scientism. Hanioglu depicts a pragmatic Atatürk who could use Islamic or socialist symbolism as needed (one chapter is titled “Muslim Communism?”) but who was, most of all, a zealot pushing a surcharged agenda of a secularizing, modernizing Turkish nationalism. The many top-down changes that Atatürk imposed in religion, language, dress, and even the arts make for fascinating reading today. Nearly nine decades after the end of the Ottoman era, Turkey and the post-Ottoman Middle East are still digesting and resisting the ideas of Atatürk.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

It then describes the asymmetric interactions of the governing institutions that produce Pakistani foreign policy, covering the military (including the intelligence service), career diplomats and the bureaucracy, and politicians -- an effort that makes clear how much the military dominates. The book also tracks U.S.-Pakistani negotiations from the time of Pakistani President Muhammad Ayub Khan (who ruled from 1958 to 1969) to the present. Pakistan’s perception of India as an existential threat warrants a separate chapter on Indian-Pakistani negotiations, which highlights the contrasting styles Pakistan uses when negotiating with India versus when negotiating with the United States. Schaffer and Schaffer, seasoned specialists, have put to good use their many interviews with American and Pakistani officials in showing that cultural cues are important. Even so, the question they raise remains: “Can two countries whose tactical goals overlap but whose strategic priorities diverge significantly negotiate a reliable basis for cooperation?”Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

He gives due attention to the potential for incomplete, inaccurate, or corrupt data. A devotee of statistical analysis, Fish has made a real, and largely successful, effort to make his findings accessible to the innumerate.

Klein traces the emergence of an overall Israeli “control system” that deals differently with five distinct Palestinian groups: citizens of Israel (about 20 percent of Israel’s population), the 260,000 residents of East Jerusalem, the 2.4 million who live in Gaza, and, in the West Bank, the 500,000 who live to the west of the separation barrier and the 3.3 million who live to the east. Since 1967, the Israeli-Palestinian confrontation has turned into what it was before 1948: an ethnic conflict, not a border struggle. But now, the initiative lies overwhelmingly with the stronger party, Israel. Klein even likens Israeli control of the Palestinians to colonialism, with striking comparisons to Algeria under French rule. He hits another hot button in arguing cogently that the system amounts to apartheid, but a softer apartheid than prevailed in South Africa. Clearly, getting back to borders should be the goal. But, Klein writes, “Israelis and Palestinians find themselves trapped between what is unachievable today -- the two-state solution -- and what can never be achieved -- a unitary non-ethnic democracy.”Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

Up until the early nineteenth century, these were principally writers, often poets, such as Gavrila Derzhavin, Catherine the Great’s favorite, or Vasily Zhukovsky, a leading literary figure in Alexander I’s era. Later, beginning with Nicholas I, composers and artists also made their entrance into the royal court, preoccupied as it was with art’s utility in embellishing the imperial order and, before the century’s end, with its capacity play to the people’s rising sense of nationalism. The intriguing element in Volkov’s book is not so much the choice of the celebrated (Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, Leo Tolstoy, and Anton Chekhov by the last two tsars), the shunned (Modest Mussorgsky in Alexander III’s day and Maxim Gorky in Nicholas II’s), and the enfants terribles (Alexander Pushkin for Nicholas I). Rather, it is the time the emperor or empress took to influence an opera’s title or scene, alter a stanza of poetry, or secure the election of someone as an honorary member to the Imperial Academy of Sciences.

Radovan Karadzic, then the leader of the Bosnian Serbs and the president of the Republika Srpska, made that clear in 1992, when he articulated six “strategic goals” in the unfolding Bosnian tragedy. Although the forces under the Bosnian Serb military leader Ratko Mladic and their auxiliary elements were not the only guilty parties (the Croatian military and the Bosnian government forces share in the blame), they were more responsible than any other group for driving two million Bosnians from their homes, an effort that was intended to shatter Bosnia’s basic form and redraw it along ethnoterritorial lines. They largely succeeded. As the authors of Bosnia Remade demonstrate in their painstaking assessment of the 1995 Dayton accord, which was designed to reverse this success, although sizable numbers of the displaced have recovered their homes or been compensated, the more fundamental imprint of the war persists in the attitudes prevalent in the country’s now-partitioned parts. What gives perspective to the authors’ analysis is the long haul of history in which they situate it."

Such has been the case in the former socialist societies of central and eastern Europe. Mark systematically explores the past as processed in the present in countries from the Baltics to Romania. Not surprisingly, in these places the history of the communist period is mediated by political agendas and individual self-interest. He focuses on both the macro level (competing political parties, history commissions, institutes of national memory, and physical memorials) and the individual level (oral histories reconstructed from personal interviews). Both categories are largely organized around ex-Communists and anticommunists, who, after the early muddled period of transition, have come to hold very different views of the fall of communism in 1989. For the first group, 1989 is a closed book, opening the way to a fresh start. For the second, it is an incomplete break, leaving an opening for elements from the past to creep back in. But the role of history in this battle, fought out in both the political arena and scarred personal psychologies, is far more intricate, and Mark traces these complexities with skill.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

Others have told the story of how the decision was taken, the war conducted, and the international politics of it handled, but the details of the war’s painful ending have remained obscure. Kalinovsky goes over the whole story briefly and then, with a large cache of archival material, firsthand accounts, and interviews, takes the reader deep inside the Soviet decision-making process as first Mikhail Gorbachev’s aging predecessors and then Gorbachev and his circle struggled awkwardly to settle on an exit strategy that would not bring the roof down. Listening to their tortured internal arguments, watching the KGB and the Soviet military battle each other, witnessing the confusion stirred by half-clear, shifting strategies, and seeing how the hopes of salvaging some fragment of stability in this ravaged country strung out the inevitable outcome and led to an ongoing entanglement even after the last Soviet soldier had left should have a haunting familiarity.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

One such case is Tatarstan, one of 16 autonomous republics in Russia where nationalism swelled in the tumult following the collapse of the Soviet Union. But it soon faded, as it did in the few other areas like it, and Giuliano sets out to explain why. Her answer, after she collates a variety of political and economic data on the 16 regions, comes down to economics and political entrepreneurship. It is not structural socioeconomic conditions, as is often assumed, that fuel separatism, she finds, but the immediate fear of unemployment or lost opportunity, anxieties that nationalist leaders skillfully cast in a narrative favoring national independence. When the underlying fear eases, the nationalist mobilizers lose their appeal. The book provides a neat explanation for outcomes in the Russian case with obvious and important policy implications for those managing multiethnic societies, but it leaves one wondering how far it goes in explaining outcomes elsewhere.

Yet it is not too much to suggest that readers would be hard-pressed to find a more subtle and lucid account of why his effort to strengthen the state’s coercive arm failed to dent corruption, protect property rights, or advance the rule of law. This is by far the most thorough and systematic study of Russia’s so-called power ministries, charged with administering the state’s monopoly over the legitimate use of force. The basic fact that scarcely a quarter of the Russian population thinks the police protect the public interest, rather than their own self-interests or those of their masters, and a trove of similar facts reflect the surface detritus of the Russian leadership’s effort to build state capacity without considering the factors rendering the effort ineffective and, indeed, counterproductive. The idea of a state that works -- Taylor calls it “state quality” -- flows from Taylor’s remarkably rich and productive tour through the best of the theoretical work on the state, which he refines even further. This lends great depth to his detailed probing of Russian agencies’ inner workings, performance, and impact. Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

The volume describes the high hopes that Barack Obama’s election engendered throughout the region and skillfully lays out why the honeymoon is waning: although Obama has significantly altered U.S. policy in the region, the change has been less than Latin America (and these writers) would have liked. The chapters written by non-U.S. scholars are particularly lucid and should help readers understand why Latin Americans feel so disillusioned with the United States. The book eschews a hemisphere-wide grand strategy in favor of engagement on select issues, a more modest approach than one usually finds in books about U.S. policy. Even as policymakers in Washington confront unprecedented challenges to U.S. interests around the world, attempt to revive a sputtering U.S. economy, and brace themselves for the upcoming presidential election, they would do well to heed this book’s spot-on recommendations for U.S. policy toward the restless region to their south.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

Their assessment is not encouraging. From the unfinished agenda of economic, trade, and energy integration to the limited progress of subregional arrangements such as Mercosur and the North American Free Trade Agreement, the volume uncovers both strategic and tactical hurdles that raise larger questions of self-identity and common interests. Given the vast disparities within this diverse region, which encompasses both major economies and vulnerable island states, the pan-American dream has never felt more distant. As governments experiment with new and more varied institutional arrangements at both the presidential and the technocratic levels, including partnerships with countries outside the hemisphere, the regional order seems to be best described as one of diffuse multipolarity. To preserve its influence in such a system, the United States will have to navigate Brazil’s ambitions to lead South America and China’s race to secure resources in a way that will mitigate conflict and protect long-standing U.S. interests.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

Along with the many fascinating historical connections she draws, readers will learn that that the transfer of remittances and business skills among immigrant family members to aid the development of small enterprises, in both Cuba and their countries of origin, has a long tradition. Cervantes-Rodríguez praises the Obama administration for allowing Cuban Americans to return to Cuba and send cash to their island-bound relatives and criticizes the Cuban government for maintaining unusual travel restrictions, even as it now exports professional labor to accumulate scarce foreign currency.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

Krauze’s long, loving ode to his mentor and friend the Nobel Prize–winning writer Octavio Paz could stand on its own as a major contribution to the literature on Paz and twentieth-century Mexico. In it, he traces the poet-philosopher’s journey from his father’s Zapatista faith back to his grandfather’s nineteenth-century antireligious liberalism. In other sketches, Krauze savages Argentine First Lady Evita Perón, the Argentine revolutionary Che Guevara, and Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez for the cults of the great leader and the authoritarian military caudillo that they have led, “a distant echo both of Moorish sheiks and Christian warlords.” The liberal Peruvian writer Mario Vargas Llosa compares favorably, in Krauze’s sketch, to the Colombian writer Gabriel García Márquez, whose journalism “did not practice magic realism so much as socialist realism.” Krauze finds value in the originality and complexity of the Cuban independence fighter José Martí and in the brilliance of the Peruvian philosopher of indigenous Marxism José Carlos Mariátegui. Throughout, Krauze warns against the temptations to seek redemption through revolutionary violence, heroic martyrdom, and political absolutism. He also helps readers understand the two separate strains of anti-Americanism in Latin America -- “the abstract ideological disdain of the Southern Cone and the grievance-fueled resentments of the Caribbean” -- that are very much alive today.

Mexico and the Mexicans,"Although not all readers will accept Castañeda’s core thesis -- that Mexico’s drive toward modernity is being delayed by traditional cultural characteristics that have proved counterproductive -- Mañana Forever is brimming with lively observations on all things Mexico. A former foreign minister, Castañeda settles scores with the intellectual and media elites who frustrated his efforts to update Mexican foreign policy. Castañeda wants to ramp up the North American Free Trade Agreement, turning it into a full-fledged regional economic union with a single currency (in effect, dumping the peso for the greenback). But first, he maintains, Mexicans must rise out of their backward-looking defensive crouch, rewrite their history books, and stop denigrating the United States; it is high time, he says, for Mexicans to improve their self-esteem and build a more cooperative civil society. Castañeda pins his hopes on his country’s modernizing middle class, and he imagines a Mexico bound together by a new respect for the rule of law and competitive economics, and yet one that still honors its rich regional diversity. Some of the better passages take the reader into Mexican homes and neighborhoods about which Castañeda, a peripatetic public intellectual, speaks authoritatively from firsthand experience.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

In that time, he has tended to support political causes -- notably the British Social Democratic, New Labour, and Liberal Democratic movements -- only to turn on them later. He has also supported European integration, and in this book he turns on it, too. He does so for a reason that has led many other Europeans to reject integration: he cannot tolerate its ambiguity. The EU’s unique structure, half state and half international organization, has facilitated success and growth for over a half century -- longer than most nation-states in the world today have existed. Yet now, Marquand believes, only transforming the EU into something more like the United States, with stronger central institutions and direct democratic representation, can save it from dissolution. In the end, Marquand gives no reason why this will -- or, indeed, should -- take place. Perhaps what Europe needs instead is a new, more decentralized vision. Yet the mere fact that so many books of this kind are written testifies to the controversy over the meaning of the European experiment.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

Do Europeans (and Americans) portray Islam as static, monolithic, and reactionary? This volume, edited by a French researcher at Harvard, examines whether such “cultural talk” triggers Western overreaction and inflames Muslim opposition both inside and outside Europe and the United States. It is something of a grab bag of perspectives, heavier on speculation than on hard sociological, economic, and political data. Yet the general tendency -- oddly enough, given the premise of the book -- seems to disconfirm the notion that Western perspectives on Islam matter much. One contribution finds such hostile stereotypes mainly among extremists. Another points out that European efforts to combat terrorism have been largely successful. Still another points out that such views are more prevalent in the United States, where Muslims have been more fully integrated than in Europe. One comes away with the impression that the integration of minorities reflects a far more complex range of factors than cultural stereotypes."

Based on this premise, this original and engaging book offers a unique, street-level view of European history. Politics have played out on the European street through strikes, revolutions, and coups but have ultimately achieved bourgeois tranquility. Culture -- opera, jazz, nightclubs, soccer stadiums, cinemas, television studios -- has become essentially urban. Cities have spawned new lifestyles, from novel sexual mores to complex ethnic and racial identities. The mass planning of cities to achieve environmental, epidemiological, ideological, and aesthetic objectives has become a model for state intervention in the economy as a whole. Indeed, perhaps the greatest danger facing European cities today is that government policy threatens the creativity, diversity, and chaos that define the continent’s identity.

Kelemen, a political scientist, argues that this is not because Europe copied the United States but because the two have faced similar challenges. The decentralized nature of the EU means that when leaders seek to liberalize markets and enact common regulations, they often must do so by granting individual rights and privileges that will ultimately be enforced by courts. As a result, EU law, like U.S. law, is both transparent and legalistic, formally defined yet subject to constant adjudication. Kelemen traces parallel trajectories in antitrust law, disability rights, and securities regulation. Sometimes resulting from economic interests and sometimes from normative beliefs, the legal system that has emerged in the EU is a complex one firmly grounded in European society. This book is more synthetic than analytic, building on two decades of work by many scholars, but it serves as a useful introduction to the subject. And by demonstrating the flexibility and sophistication of European law, it poses a challenge to skeptics who, perhaps encouraged by recent headlines, believe that the EU is an insubstantial and inessential organization likely to collapse in the face of economic crisis."

In most respects, such as trade, investment, research, and development assistance, Europe dwarfs China and India and continues to surpass the United States. Yet the generally antigovernment bias of most economic analyses, the tendency to treat Europe as a set of small countries rather than as a whole, and salient events such as the recent euro crisis lead many to question whether the European model is sustainable. This data-rich volume evaluates Europe’s global competitive position and suggests ways to strengthen it. The advice is sensible: European policymakers should focus on services, knowledge-intensive sectors, and green technology and work collectively through the EU to liberalize markets, streamline regulations, and promote innovation. To be sure, the recommendations are somewhat technocratic. For example, liberalizing immigration laws, promoting intergenerational equity, and deregulating public services appear as economic objectives, not as contested social and political issues. Yet this optimistic prognosis is an important corrective to the prevailing pessimism."

For Coulter, modern American liberalism is directly descended from the violent mob rule of the atheistic French Revolution; in the antiwar group CodePink, she sees echoes of the crowds heckling Marie Antoinette on the way to the guillotine. By way of contrast, Coulter’s conservatives are perfect cavaliers whose scrupulous respect for private property, small government, and the rule of law reflects the God-fearing tradition of the Founding Fathers. The depiction of the American left as a howling Jacobin mob is part of a venerable tradition in American politics; Coulter reproduces core arguments that Alexander Hamilton and the Federalists made against the Jeffersonian Republicans in the 1790s. This is reassuring, since it suggests that the partisanship and bitterness of the present day is no more threatening to the country than many past episodes of polarization."

One year after the death of Osama bin Laden, al Qaeda’s crop seems mixed. The organization’s central leadership, operating in Afghanistan and Pakistan, has nearly collapsed, but its offshoots are mounting full-blown insurgencies in Somalia and Yemen. The group’s operatives have failed to carry out major strikes on U.S. or European soil, but its online supporters still excite fear among Western governments and media. And al Qaeda’s argument against democracy has lost out in Arab nations where long-ruling autocrats have fallen, but its gospel of violence continues to resonate in those countries where dictators refuse to abdicate. Yet although some al Qaeda plots have continued to succeed, the organization has hardly experienced the bounty that it long expected."

Some of the foreign policy actors whose actions disturb the United States the most (al Qaeda, Hezbollah, Iran) are motivated in part by religion. In many sub-Saharan countries where governments are weak and poorly placed, religious entities are often the only organizations with a national reach. For these reasons and more, U.S. policymakers must come to grips with religion in new and more fruitful ways. Johnston recommends ways that the U.S. foreign policy apparatus can minimize the harm religion can do and, where possible, integrate a deeper religious understanding into both the development and the execution of its strategy. He calls for a group of “religion attachés,” similar to the labor attachés who have served in many U.S. embassies since the early days of the Cold War, and for teaching Foreign Service officers more about religion throughout their careers. The second recommendation seems more urgent; if political officers, heads of mission, and senior State Department personnel do not fully appreciate the importance of religion, then his proposed religion attachés are unlikely to be used well.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

He charges that the United States has lost sight of two vital elements of foreign policy: grand strategy and what he calls “full spectrum diplomacy.” The specialized and technocratic mindset of the functionaries populating the U.S. government, Lenczowski holds, has reduced the country’s foreign policy to a set of unrelated initiatives and negotiations. Blindly tunneling bureaucrats in many different offices dig industriously, but U.S. foreign policy as a whole has no shape. In Lenczowski’s view, hard-power enthusiasts underestimate the importance of soft power, and soft-power proponents shy away from frankly using all available forms of power to advance U.S. interests. He argues that a less dysfunctional relationship between the two sides could be found during the early years of the Cold War, when public diplomacy, economic aid, military policy, and cultural interventions (such as the CIA’s support for the Congress for Cultural Freedom, an anticommunist group) worked together as part of an effective strategy to combat communism. The comparison with today, Lenczowski acknowledges, is not exact, and some of his examples and prescriptions will strike readers as far-fetched.

Marable performs a signal service in providing a fresh look at the man and replacing the simplified version of his life presented in The Autobiography of Malcolm X with a more complex and accurate portrait. Marable asserts that the real life of Malcolm X was sadder and more complicated than the airbrushed version Malcolm’s collaborator, the journalist Alex Haley, put forth in the posthumously completed autobiography. What emerges from Marable’s book is the story of an angry young man’s desperate quest for a legitimate and powerful father figure in a hostile world. (Malcolm’s own father was likely killed by white vigilantes.) Elijah Muhammad of the Nation of Islam was Malcolm’s first father-hero; African politicians such as Moise Tshombe and Kwame Nkrumah filled the void when Muhammad was found wanting. Malcolm himself remains a compelling figure, even as the causes to which he devoted himself become less relevant; Marable’s thoughtful and well-written book helps one understand why.

The competition for British support was one of the major drivers of events in both the Union and the Confederacy. The hope that “King Cotton” would force the British to recognize and support the Confederacy was one reason that many Southerners believed their rebellion could win; the United Kingdom’s decision to honor the North’s initially porous blockade of Confederate ports cut the South off from the foreign markets and supplies without which it could not long survive. Foreman looks at the conflict through four sets of eyes: those of the British politicians and officials who tried to avoid offending either side while pursuing what they saw as their country’s interests in the war, those of the Confederate and Union diplomats and agents in the United Kingdom, those of the British subjects who for various reasons joined or were dragooned into the armies of the contending parties, and those of the British foreign correspondents and writers who covered the war. The result is an illuminating and engaging book that casts new light on figures such as U.S. Senator Charles Sumner, U.S. Secretary of State William Seward, and the Confederate leader Jefferson Davis.

This means that it is also starting to get high-level academic attention. Kelleher and Reppy have collected an impressive group of scholars who assume the objective of a nonnuclear world and then explore how this might be achieved and what it might mean. The chapters cover individual countries and a range of practical, institutional, and conceptual problems.

The awkward division of Germany in 1945 left West Berlin as a Western strategic outpost behind the Iron Curtain and a bolthole for Germans stuck in the communist East. The crisis grew as more and more of them escaped during the first half of 1961, in part because they feared that the Soviet Union and its East German clients might succeed in controlling the city. The crisis ended with the construction of the Berlin Wall, leaving East Germans stuck but making possible an uneasy coexistence between NATO and the Warsaw Pact. Kempe demonstrates the interplay of character and calculation as he describes how the main protagonists, the Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev and U.S. President John F. Kennedy, tried to manage a conflict that seemed to have no resolution other than war but was not really worth a war. Some irritating muddles on the associated conflict over Cuba aside, this is a skillful work of Cold War history."

It takes a special sort of mind to prepare to kill large numbers of people on the basis of a highly speculative political analysis. Orsini’s remarkable book gets as close as any to understanding this sort of thinking. Although it can be hard going at times, with dollops of pedantic sociology, the book is sustained throughout by stark and candid quotes from past members of the Red Brigades, an Italian terrorist group active in the 1970s. The Red Brigades were animated by a simplistic Marxism, and Orsini is at pains to stress the importance of ideology in legitimating terrorism. It is not hard to recognize similar tendencies in other groups: the conviction that the group has a vanguard role that enables its members to see the struggle with unmatched clarity, the belief that unswerving devotion to the cause creates a right to do anything for it, and a readiness to deny the humanity of all opponents. Although Orsini does not compare his leftist terrorists with Islamists, he does show elements of the same mindset in past Marxist groups and also in contemporary neofascists."

As Byman reminds readers in this comprehensive, balanced, and sharply written history, Jewish militants relied on force from the start to push the British out and keep the Arabs at bay. As the security threat took new forms, the Israelis remained determined not to even hint at weakness. And as Byman shows, they enjoyed some notable successes in disrupting Palestinian terrorist campaigns, especially in the early years of this century. Targeted assassinations have now become established as a legitimate counterterrorist tactic beyond Israel, despite misgivings about their legality and effectiveness. Undertaken with sufficient ruthlessness and regularity, they can do serious damage to a militant organization. But they can also prompt retaliation, and whatever the operational gains that targeted killings reap, they can involve severe political costs. Byman makes a similar judgment about the physical barrier separating the Palestinians from the Israelis; an operational case for it can be made, but the political downsides are substantial. Indeed, Israel’s persistent security predicament suggests that when it comes to counterterrorism, as with other aspects of strategy, the core problem is the failure to integrate the military and the political.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."
55,"Energy: Perspectives, Problems, and Prospects",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2011-09-01/energy-perspectives-problems-and-prospects,"Energy: Perspectives, Problems, and Prospects","This book, written by a Harvard physicist for people who remember some of their high school physics and are unfazed by numbers, provides quantitative answers to most of their questions about energy. It presents a whirlwind history of humans’ relationship with energy sources, which at first was mostly wood and brawn, with help from domesticated animals, wind, and water. All that changed when Abraham Darby discovered how to make coke from coal in 1709 and when, soon after, Thomas Newcomen invented the steam-driven pump. These two technical leaps ushered in the age of coal-generated steam power -- and the age of fossil-fuel dependency. McElroy’s book includes an extensive discussion of the physics and geology of coal, oil, and natural gas, along with useful chapters on nuclear energy, electricity, transportation, climate change, carbon capture, and ethanol (which, McElroy points out, will do nothing to mitigate climate change if it is made from corn but could be helpful if it could be made economically from cellulose). The book has a clearheaded discussion of a low-carbon energy future. Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

In Banker to the World, he reminisces about his challenging, and sometimes harrowing, experiences, organizing the book around eight lessons that he derived from them. These include the value of prompt, decisive action and of knowing the culture, history, and customs of the people on the other side of the negotiating table. Rhodes covers the debt restructurings of Nicaragua (1980), Mexico (1982), Brazil (1983), Argentina (1992), South Korea (1998), and Uruguay (2002) and the nonrestructuring by Argentina (2001). He also recounts Citibank’s successful efforts to engage in eastern Europe after the fall of communism and to reengage in China, a market its predecessor entered in 1902. For those interested in the operational side of international finance, this is an absorbing read."

Shaxson, a British journalist, especially attacks the remnants of the British Empire -- Bermuda, the Cayman Islands, the Channel Islands, and the like -- and their supporters in the City of London and in the British political establishment, but their American fellow travelers also get a drubbing. He makes clear that “offshore” is a misnomer, since many ostensibly offshore practices have been adopted onshore in the United Kingdom and the United States. The U.S. state of Delaware and the British-controlled island of Jersey receive special scrutiny, and in the author’s view, the legislatures of small jurisdictions such as these are in effect for hire by major outside financial interests. Many of them enshrine client secrecy in law, which, not surprisingly, attracts wealthy people and companies (and criminal organizations) wanting to evade taxes and disagreeable regulations. Shaxson is not impressed with efforts during the past decade, seemingly led by the U.S. government, to make this global system more accessible to law enforcement agencies. Influential Americans, especially in finance, have too great a personal interest in preserving and even enlarging the gaping holes in the existing systems of taxation and regulation."

Drawing on the history of successful international negotiations, Victor counsels greater patience; the term “urgent,” he says, is overused in public discussions of climate change. He argues that a smallish club of the major greenhouse gas emitters (including, of course, China and the United States) should undertake serious negotiations on actions to be taken, not just targets to shoot for. Victor also contends that existing technologies are not likely to limit climate change significantly, and so a major collaborative effort to develop new ones is called for. Given past emissions, some climate change is inevitable, putting a premium on strategies of adaptation. But adapting to climate change, in Victor’s view, will primarily be a local challenge, dependent on local circumstances, not an issue for a grand global bargain.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

Kenny, a World Bank economist, does this magnificently in this well-written book. Its main message is simple: that quality of life has improved greatly almost everywhere over the past century, even in places (such as Africa) where per capita incomes have stayed relatively flat. Looking at improvements in that measure, which is favored by economists, is in fact a poor way to gauge improvements in overall living conditions. Infant and maternal mortality have plummeted, and people today enjoy better nutrition and protection against disease, more education, better access to infrastructure, and greater personal freedom than ever before. To be sure, there is much room for improvement. But making progress need not be vastly expensive, since it mainly involves transmitting ideas and information. Kenny offers a lighthearted critical survey of what economists have had to say about the determinants of economic growth, but he argues that growth, although important and desirable, should not be the main objective.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

Ikenberry’s important book tackles this complex subject, giving readers a deep understanding of the factors that determine the type of international order. As Ikenberry explains, orders can be built on balance (as was the case in Europe for centuries), command (as the British Empire was), or consent (as he argues today’s U.S.-led liberal hegemonic order is). After World War II, the United States built and deepened this liberal hegemonic order, and Ikenberry delineates the ways in which it has served everyone’s interests -- including those of the rising powers. Today, however, somewhat ironically, the order is becoming “the victim of its own success,” as those powers are beginning to threaten U.S. dominance and as the growing acceptance of intervention in states’ internal affairs erodes Westphalian norms of sovereignty. Ikenberry argues that it is time to rebuild the order, and he provides solid grounds for confidence in the durability of its core. The specific form of the reworked liberal order, he explains, will depend on many factors, including the preferences of not only the United States but also China and India. While acknowledging that the future international order is hard to predict, Liberal Leviathan is a valuable guide to understanding the factors that will determine its eventual shape."

As the wars of conquest and territorial defense that marked earlier eras have given way to “wars of choice,” limited military actions, and humanitarian interventions, the moral principles that leaders might wish to invoke when contemplating the use of military force have become increasingly murky. In this thoughtful treatise, a former British defense official provides a welcome restatement of the “just war” tradition in the context of current security challenges. In part, the book is a survey of religious and secular thinking about morality and war. But Fisher’s main interest is in identifying the changing moral choices and circumstances that confront contemporary would-be war-makers. Preemptive war, humanitarian intervention, strategic bombing, torture -- Fisher probes these and other controversial areas of modern-day warfare, arguing for the relevance of just war principles. The book eloquently makes clear that no one, from the soldier in the trenches to the commander in chief, can escape moral choice. The only question is whether one’s choices are worthy and well reasoned.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

In this impressive volume, a group of mostly younger academics does just that. Snyder argues that religion can alter the basic patterns of international relations: who the actors are, what they want, what capacities they have to attract support, and what rules they follow. Islamic groups, Christian fundamentalists, and the Falung Gong all impinge on world politics in various ways. Religious movements can reinforce state authority or undermine it, and religion can reinforce the territorial boundaries of states or mobilize loyalties that cut across borders. Timothy Samuel Shah and Daniel Philpott trace the rise and fall of secularism in international relations. Monica Duffy Toft explores the connections between religion and war, arguing that religion, not unlike nationalism, can help its devotees rationalize self-sacrifice in support of a larger community. Il Hyun Cho and Peter Katzenstein argue that Confucianism in East Asia survived the region’s modernization and is now an important tool for bolstering state authority and regional identity there.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."
63,Why Niebuhr Now?,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2011-09-01/why-niebuhr-now,Why Niebuhr Now?,"The theologian and philosopher Reinhold Niebuhr rose to prominence in the 1940s and 1950s with his writings and lectures on the struggles between the United States’ liberal democracy and its fascist and totalitarian challengers. In recent years, American political figures on both the right and the left (including President Barack Obama) have rediscovered him. This little book by the late historian Diggins seeks to explain Niebuhr’s continuing appeal. He tracks Niebuhr’s intellectual journey as a critic of Christian idealism and the radical left, a champion of an imperfect social justice, and an advocate of foreign policy realism. Niebuhr grounded his philosophy in a sober view of the limits of reason and collective action and the elusiveness of mankind’s quest for, as he put it, “perpetual peace and brotherhood for human society.” During the Cold War, he fashioned a distinctive realist view of the United States’ mission, urging both activism and restraint, moral conviction and humility. It was a Christian realism in which U.S. foreign policy would seek justice and show mercy, always aware that conflict and misery are inherent in the human condition. Niebuhr’s vision is attractive in part because of the world-weary assumptions on which it is based: no one should expect too much from science, modernity, or the goodwill of others.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."
64,Empire of Humanity: A History of Humanitarianism,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2011-09-01/empire-humanity-history-humanitarianism,Empire of Humanity: A History of Humanitarianism,"One of the most striking features of world politics in the last 200 years was the rise of humanitarianism, the sustained efforts by outsiders to save lives and help those too weak to help themselves. Barnett paints an expansive portrait of that ascent, breaking it down into three distinct ages. From the nineteenth century to World War II, humanitarian intervention existed as part of colonialism, commerce, and Western “civilizing” missions. During the Cold War, it became part of the East-West struggle and the worldwide movement toward state sovereignty and national development. The end of the Cold War gave birth to an ambitious project of liberal humanitarianism that was tied to globalization and the spread of liberal democracy and human rights. Barnett’s point is that humanitarianism is a “creature of the world it aspires to civilize,” rather than some sort of abstract ideal that unfolds amid the chaos and violence of world politics. In making that argument, he includes rich details about the visionaries, missionaries, transnational activists, UN agencies, and democracies that intervened in such places as Nigeria, Cambodia, and Kosovo. Barnett is a realist in that he sees geopolitics and self-serving motives at every historical turn, but he is also an idealist, taking seriously the “ethic of compassion” that informs people and governments.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

That day was a tragedy not only for me but also for all Koreans. Despite the unbearable pain of that event, I have wished and worked for enduring peace on the Korean Peninsula ever since. But 37 years later, the conflict on the peninsula persists. The long-simmering tensions between North and South Korea resulted in an acute crisis in November 2010.

Israeli policymakers are furious with the demand that Obama made early in his term that Israel freeze settlement construction in the West Bank and with his declaration in May that Israel's 1967 borders should serve as the starting point for peace discussions. Palestinian leaders, for their part, believe that Obama has failed to fulfill the promise he made in his June 2009 Cairo speech to back their legitimate aspirations for statehood, and they are irritated that he has not forced the Israelis to continue the settlement freeze. The recent decisions by Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas to strike a unity deal with Hamas and press for UN recognition of Palestinian statehood is a sign of how frustrated with Washington he has become."

In some parts of the country, the police find themselves outgunned by drug traffickers and must rely on the armed forces. Meanwhile, the United States suffers from the widespread abuse of cocaine, heroin, methamphetamines, and cannabis; violence and disorder surrounding retail drug markets; property theft and violent crime committed by drug abusers; and mass incarceration, including half a million people behind bars for drug offenses and at least as many for crimes committed for money to buy drugs."

The death and misery that resulted were beamed out to a global television audience, unleashing public sympathy on an unprecedented scale. More than half of all U.S. households donated to the relief operation. But whereas the government responses to the nearly 3,000 killed on 9/11 have ensured that that event has remained at the center of global attention for the decade since, memories of the more than 200,000 Haitians slain by the earthquake, and of the approximately 4,000 more who died of cholera after it, have quickly faded."
70,Human Rights in the Twentieth Century,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2011-09-01/human-rights-twentieth-century,Human Rights in the Twentieth Century,"This important collection brings together historians attempting to chronicle the contested path Enlightenment ideas about human rights took as they made their way across the centuries and into the heart of contemporary world politics. The authors are united in the conviction that the rise of human rights around the world was historically contingent and politically contested. The American and French Revolutions of the late eighteenth century generated a language of human rights, but this was eclipsed in the nineteenth century by the rival concepts of nation, race, class, and civilization. Hoffmann and his colleagues argue that it was only in the conflicts and crises following World War II that human rights became a universal moral ideal. Several chapters look at postwar Europe and the connections there among political unification, Cold War anticommunism, and the emergence of a European human rights regime. Others take up decolonization and the internationalization of human rights. Even though colonial states had their own perspectives on human rights, by using these norms as moral and political tools to pressure Western states into granting them independence and supporting their development, they joined the global human rights regime. As several authors in this book argue, the United States has also used the language of universal human rights, in its case to bolster its own hegemonic legitimacy."

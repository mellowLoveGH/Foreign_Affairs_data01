Kalyvas, one of the leading comparative political scientists of his generation, takes a more thoughtful and measured approach. His insightful introduction to Greece’s modern political history argues, somewhat surprisingly, that the country has often been ambitious and successful. The Greeks established the first independent state in Ottoman Europe, imposed egalitarian land reforms, fought off communism, generated substantial economic growth, and now maintain a stable, inclusive, and liberal democracy. This record compares quite favorably with that of the rest of the Balkans (which share Greece’s geography and history of foreign occupation), much of Latin America (which shares Greece’s autarkic interwar policies), and southern Italy (which, like Greece, suffers from tax evasion, corruption, and clientelism). Yet precisely because the goals have been so ambitious, Greece’s road to modernity has been paved with intermittent disasters that have drawn in the great powers. Each half-successful modernization effort has eventually triggered an economic boom and bust; the current economic crisis is Greece’s seventh in modern times. Kalyvas’ slim volume puts this story into perspective with remarkable clarity and brevity. If you read one general introduction to Greek politics, this should be it.The Greeks established the first independent state in Ottoman Europe, imposed egalitarian land reforms, fought off communism, generated substantial economic growth, and now maintain a stable, inclusive, and liberal democracy.

1,The China Challenge: Shaping the Choices of a Rising Power,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2015-12-14/china-challenge-shaping-choices-rising-power,The China Challenge: Shaping the Choices of a Rising Power,"The debate over how the United States should respond to the rise of China is usually based on the premise that a power transition is taking place. But Christensen characterizes this idea as at least premature and probably flat wrong. He draws from his academic research and policy experience as a deputy assistant secretary of state under President George W. Bush to present an exceptionally clear and subtle analysis of the evolving U.S.-Chinese relationship. Although China is “nowhere near a peer competitor,” its “reactive assertiveness” presents a real risk of conflict, which has to be countered by a strong U.S. presence in Asia. This presence, however, must be balanced by assurances, expressed more in actions than in words, that the United States does not threaten Chinese security. Christensen gives examples from recent administrations of some moves that succeeded in walking this fine line and others that failed. He argues that an even more difficult challenge is to get China to bear its share of the costs in managing global problems such as climate change and nuclear proliferation. Beijing is likely to cooperate on such issues not in response to moral preaching but when it sees direct benefits from doing so. Washington should not panic about the rise of China, but it needs a steady and nuanced strategy to shape Chinese behavior."
2,The Lost Territories: Thailand's History of National Humiliation,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2015-08-14/lost-territories-thailands-history-national-humiliation,The Lost Territories: Thailand’s History of National Humiliation,"Alongside the conventional, celebratory narrative that holds up Thailand as the one Southeast Asian country that preserved its independence throughout the period of colonialism, there exists a second story that portrays Thailand as a victim of Western imperialism: forced to sign unequal treaties, to allow for extraterritorial jurisdiction, and, above all, to sign away large parts of its traditional lands to neighboring British and French colonies. In the 1930s and 1940s, this view was promoted to support military rule and Thailand’s alliance with Japan, which enabled Thailand to temporarily annex some of the territories it had previously lost. Strate’s revealing account ends in the 1960s, when the International Court of Justice rejected Thailand’s claim to the Cambodian-controlled Preah Vihear temple, a decision many Thais have still not accepted. This little-known history of an imaginary “Greater Thailand” helps explain Bangkok’s current tensions with its neighbors, its resentment of Western pressure, and its reluctance to recognize the distinct ethnicities of its minority populations."
3,Army and Nation: The Military and Indian Democracy since Independence,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2015-08-13/army-and-nation-military-and-indian-democracy-independence,Army and Nation: The Military and Indian Democracy since Independence,"The protection of Indian democracy from military intervention looks on the surface like an unlikely achievement, given the weak institutions of civilian control that India inherited from the British Raj. Reaching back to the early years of independence, however, Wilkinson shows that India’s new leaders took measures to prevent coups, such as institutionalizing internal divisions within the army’s leadership, placing top officers under surveillance, assigning domestic intelligence to a civilian agency, and creating civilian-controlled paramilitary forces to handle internal security and counterinsurgency. In this insightful book, he pays most attention to what he calls “compositional strategies”: shifts in recruitment intended to weaken the ethnic coherence of the military and its constituent units. A running comparison with Pakistan helps clarify how contrasting postindependence decisions there set the stage for the military to intervene frequently. The Indian success story, however, has its downsides. The army still does too little to recruit from underrepresented groups. And coup-proof institutions have left the country with cumbersome command-and-control mechanisms that do not perform well in combat."
4,Pakistan's Enduring Challenges,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/pakistans-enduring-challenges,Pakistan’s Enduring Challenges,"The Pakistani security establishment has always relied on proxy jihadist groups to counter threats from neighboring Afghanistan and India and to destabilize Indian-ruled Kashmir. But according to the expertly researched essays in this book, jihadist attacks have boomeranged on the Pakistani state. The U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, however incomplete, has diminished the incentives for Washington to help Islamabad fight domestic jihadist groups. China and Saudi Arabia are unlikely to commit many resources to help protect Pakistan from its self-inflicted problems, which also include dysfunctional electricity and tax systems and the unreliable security of its growing nuclear arsenal. The contributors to this volume see glimmers of hope in the modest strengthening of civilian authorities over the military and the fragile growth of civil society. But there is no sign that the Pakistani “deep state” sees any alternative to its counterproductive security strategy."
5,Examining Japan's Lost Decades,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2015-08-13/examining-japans-lost-decades,Examining Japan’s Lost Decades,"Contrary to the conventional wisdom, Japan has undertaken bold structural reforms and significant policy shifts since the early 1990s, generating a more robust two-party system and a strengthened U.S.-Japanese alliance. Yet serious problems remain, among them slow economic growth, policymaking institutions that are hobbled by consensus-based procedures, and a failure to respond effectively to frictions with China and South Korea. The root of the trouble may be what one author in this excellent collection calls “demographic collapse,” with the over-65 proportion of the population surging from ten percent to 25 percent in two decades; the government has still not adopted the reforms to social and immigration policies that will be necessary to confront that issue. Other hindrances have included a halting, insufficient economic stimulus; resistance to trade liberalization; and lagging reform of corporate management. Most of the contributors to this volume are distinguished Japanese academics. Their overlapping diagnoses and prescriptions are persuasive. But they make it hard to know which people, groups, or institutions are most to blame for Japan’s problems—and whether those problems can ever be solved."

7,Restless Empire: A Historical Atlas of Russia,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2015-08-13/restless-empire-historical-atlas-russia,Restless Empire: A Historical Atlas of Russia,"The word “atlas” brings to mind a collection of geographic maps, but that image doesn’t do justice to the richness, imagination, and comprehensiveness of this physically beautiful volume. Barnes has collected and painstakingly reproduced maps and texts that trace Russian history from the origins of the Slavs (800–200 bc) to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s annexation of Crimea. He introduces maps that demonstrate migration patterns over time, the expansion of the Russian empire, changes in the region’s ethnic composition, battle positions in major wars, the location of industry under Peter the Great, the growth of the serf population, the path of Russian economic development in the nineteenth century, the location of “corrective labor” camps, and much more. The impact is visually stunning and gives this massive expanse of history a physical quality."
8,The Baltic: A History,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2015-08-13/baltic-history,The Baltic: A History,"In this book, North does for the Baltic Sea what Fernand Braudel did for another crucial body of water in his 1949 classic, The Mediterranean and the Mediterranean World in the Age of Philip II; he treats the sea and the lands surrounding it as an intersection of cultures, armies, economic trends, political formations, and trade routes and as a playing field for the ambitions of major powers. He starts with the Vikings in the eighth century and finishes with the integration of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania into the eu in 2004. North races across that great expanse of history, taking readers through the region’s experience of the Hanseatic League, the Reformation, Swedish dominance, Russian imperialism, and Soviet control, packing in details on everything from shifting trade patterns to the evolution of cities; from literature, music, art, and architecture to political organization. This makes the book a bit dense, but its manageable length allows North to provide a panoramic view that transcends mere regional history."
9,Modern Albania: From Dictatorship to Democracy in Europe,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2015-08-13/modern-albania-dictatorship-democracy-europe,Modern Albania: From Dictatorship to Democracy in Europe,"The rest of the world knows almost nothing about Albania, a tiny wedge of the Balkans. Isolated and erratically governed by the French-educated communist dictator Enver Hoxha throughout the Cold War, it was off-limits to the West and a ricocheting billiard ball in the communist world. Abrahams, a human rights specialist, knows the country well, having spent considerable time there since 1993, three years after the collapse of the old regime and the beginning of a wild experiment with democracy. In this intimate portrait of the country, he explains how the old regime—the last of the Eastern European communist regimes to fall—slowly crumbled and a democratic party, largely student-based, formed, faltered, and gave way to a transfigured communist party. What makes the Albanian story fascinating is that it is at once familiar and unique: the communist regime’s end in Albania resembled thosein East Germany and Czechoslovakia, and the Democratic Party’s loss of liberal fervor under a not-so-democratic leader reminds one of contemporary Hungary. Also familiar is the United States’ rather clueless approach, which wrongly treated Albania as only a fragment of a larger problem, in this case the conflict over neighboring Kosovo."

It tells the tale of how in 2013, 30 Greenpeace environmental activists aboard the ship Arctic Sunrise attempted to storm the Russian gas conglomerate Gazprom’s giant drilling platform north of the Arctic Circle to protest the oil and gas rush about to sweep into the region. The team was seized by Russian commandos, jailed, and faced with the prospect of lengthy prison terms. After considering the sheer audacity of the operation, the book shifts to recounting the participants’ months-long experience in a Murmansk prison, which ended with their release in an amnesty issued in advance of the Winter Olympics in Sochi in 2014. This is not one of Russia’s harshest prisons, but the prison life the book reveals is eye-opening, and Stewart describes it with great verve; the inmates exchanged written notes and cigarettes using a network of ropes strung between cell windows and generally followed the rules of their own well-regulated, communal society."
11,Conflict in Ukraine: The Unwinding of the Post--Cold War Order,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2015-08-13/conflict-ukraine-unwinding-post-cold-war-order,Conflict in Ukraine: The Unwinding of the Post--Cold War Order,"Here is a calm, clear alternative to the many emotional efforts to place blame for the crisis in Ukraine on one side alone. In the heat of a historic turn of events, policymakers and analysts often find it difficult to get outside the drama. They tend to join the fray, bolstering arguments favored by one side or the other. Menon and Rumer leave no doubt about the boundaries Russia crossed in seizing Crimea and fueling the war in eastern Ukraine, but they do not settle for the common one-dimensional explanation that attributes Russian actions to President Vladimir Putin’s alleged imperial fantasies. Instead, they step back for a wider view, looking at Ukraine’s evolution since independence; examining U.S., EU, and Russian policy before and during the crisis; and considering the long-term implications of the crisis for both Russia and Ukraine. From that perspective, the path leading to the present impasse hardly appears simple or straightforward. The modest length of the book and its crisp prose complement the efficiency and restraint of the analysis."
12,The End of Tsarist Russia: The March to World War I and Revolution,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2015-08-13/end-tsarist-russia-march-world-war-i-and-revolution,The End of Tsarist Russia: The March to World War I and Revolution,"This is a late entry into the parade of recent books occasioned by the centennial of World War I, but it is one of the best, and it offers the finest account yet of the Russia that entered that war and perished as a result. Lieven is a student of empires, and it is his rich sense of Russia as an empire in its last days that gives this book its power. What makes it both so complete and so readable, however, are his careful portraits of the complex cast of Russian actors—not just Tsar Nicholas II and his ministers but secondary figures as well—who dithered, argued, and stumbled their way into the war. Lieven has a double gift: first, for harvesting details to convey the essence of an era and, second, for finding new, startling, and clarifying elements in familiar stories. This is history with a heartbeat, and it could not be more engrossing."
13,Out of Ashes: A New History of Europe in the Twentieth Century; Rethinking the European Union,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2015-08-13/out-ashes-new-history-europe-twentieth-century-rethinking,Out of Ashes: A New History of Europe in the Twentieth Century; Rethinking the European Union,"As twentieth-century Europe recedes into the past, books are appearing that seek to make sense of it. Jarausch, a distinguished historian of Germany, views the period through the lens of the continent’s experience of modernization: a rise in economic productivity of unprecedented speed and the consequent effects on social structure, cultural discourse, and political ideas. Jarausch focuses mostly on the last of those categories, interpreting the century as the battleground for a grand conflict among three ideologies that sought to shape European political action: communism, fascism, and (more or less social) democratic capitalism. It’s a story of war, revolution, and, in its final chapters, peaceful integration. This approach is insightful, although readers will learn little about how Europeans thought, felt, expressed themselves, or lived their daily lives. A larger problem lies in the book’s relatively weak conclusion, which inadvertently shows how difficult it is for an approach like Jarausch’s to come to grips with twenty-first-century Europe, which has so far experienced hardly any war or revolution and has seen the momentum toward integration that defined the final decades of the last century grind to a halt."

Two recent books examine the current state of the country. The Greek American journalist Angelos offers a fairly conventional portrait of dysfunctional Greece, served with an extra-large dollop of local color. He concerns himself mostly with exceptional individuals on the edges of society: asylum seekers from Africa and Asia and the right-wing extremists who hate them, people who file fraudulent disability benefit claims, Greeks old enough to remember the Nazi occupation of their country, and a group of scheming civil servants who murdered their boss. This all makes for fun reading, but Angelos doesn’t do enough to show how the experiences of these groups are representative of everyday Greek life or how they will shape the country’s future."
15,"Germany, Russia, and the Rise of Geo-Economics; The Paradox of German Power",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2015-08-13/germany-russia-and-rise-geo-economics-paradox-german-power,"Germany, Russia, and the Rise of Geo-Economics; The Paradox of German Power","Germany—which boasts a trade surplus larger even than China’s, plays a preeminent role in the EU, and enjoys a reputation for sound domestic governance—might be today’s most underrated global power. Its power rests not on military might but on what Szabo describes as “geo-economic” clout, derived from the practice of a kind of commercial realpolitik that privileges the country’s economic well-being above all other interests. Especially important is the influence of big export and foreign investment firms on German policies. Szabo focuses in particular on the complex, clandestine, and sordid drama of recent German-Russian relations. The actors include giants such as the German engineering firm Siemens, which has long faced accusations of corruption and bribery (and has admitted some wrongdoing), and Gazprom, the state-controlled Russian energy conglomerate, which in 2005 hired former German Chancellor Gerhard Schröder to chair the board of an affiliate it had formed to build a major Russia–Germany gas pipeline. Szabo’s core thesis—that big business runs the show in Berlin—has been somewhat overtaken by events, as German firms have helped shoulder the large costs of sanctions against Russia and might do the same in the wake of a eurozone-backed restructuring of Greek debt. Yet this analysis remains an original and indispensable corrective to the overly political-military focus of most writing on Europe, Russia, and global politics."
16,Three Books on Cyberwar,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2015-08-13/three-books-cyberwar,Three Books on Cyberwar,"Barely a day passes without a revelation about a breach of government cyber-defenses somewhere in the world, as hackers penetrate vital servers, steal information about millions of individuals, and pour top-secret government documents onto the Internet. There is no doubt that such attacks are irritating, time-consuming, and potentially very expensive. The question is whether they are truly dangerous—tantamount to acts of terrorism, or even war."
17,The War That Must Never Be Fought: Dilemmas of Nuclear Deterrence,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2015-08-13/war-must-never-be-fought-dilemmas-nuclear-deterrence,The War That Must Never Be Fought: Dilemmas of Nuclear Deterrence,"Shultz, who served as U.S. secretary of state from 1982 to 1989, and Goodby, a former U.S. arms negotiator, make the case for governments to take urgent steps toward abolishing nuclear weapons. The well-informed contributors to this volume consider the relative costs and benefits of nuclear deterrence and nuclear disarmament, examining the particular challenges that a shift from deterrence to disarmament would pose in Europe, the Middle East, South Asia, and East Asia. All conclude that the path of disarmament is the only safe choice. But many of the chapters suffer from a problem most evident in the opening essay, by Benoît Pelopidas. Instead of exploring and highlighting the many dangers and uncertainties associated with the practice of nuclear deterrence, which are hard to deny and which lend support to the idea of reducing the role of nuclear weapons in international affairs, Pelopidas overstates the case by insisting on the irrelevance of the weapons. But as other chapters make clear, that is clearly not the view held by the governments of Iran, North Korea, Pakistan, and Russia—for the last, especially since the beginning of the war in Ukraine. Given its overall military strength, the United States could probably manage without nuclear deterrence—but that is exactly why other countries continue to seek it."
18,A Higher Form of Killing: Six Weeks in World War I That Forever Changed the Nature of Warfare,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2015-08-13/higher-form-killing-six-weeks-world-war-i-forever-changed-nature,A Higher Form of Killing: Six Weeks in World War I That Forever Changed the Nature of Warfare,"The German scientist Fritz Haber was a paradoxical figure. During World War I, he gained notoriety as the inventor of mustard gas, which added a new dimension of suffering to the western front. Haber’s culpability apparently drove his pacifist wife, who was also a scientist, to commit suicide in 1915; perhaps she would have been prouder of Haber’s Nobel Prize, which he won in 1918 for synthesizing ammonia, a vital tool in the development of fertilizers. Haber’s is one of the stories that Preston tells about the spring of 1915, when imperial Germany, frustrated by the war’s stalemate, sought to break its enemies’ wills by employing new forms of warfare: first poison gas, then submarine attacks, and finally zeppelin raids. Preston opens this vivid, compelling book by discussing the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907, which sought to humanize the conduct of war by establishing codes of conduct that would spare noncombatants. Crudely disregarding those rules did not help Germany turn the tide of the war: in fact, it made matters worse for the Germans, by drawing the United States into the fight."
19,Ranking the World: Grading States as a Tool of Global Governance,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2015-08-13/ranking-world-grading-states-tool-global-governance,Ranking the World: Grading States as a Tool of Global Governance,"Recent decades have seen a boom in rankings and ratings schemes developed by private groups, international organizations, and governments to measure and evaluate the performance of states in areas such as human development, democracy, hunger, environmental performance, media freedom, economic openness, corruption, and human rights. In this fascinating volume, Cooley, Snyder, and their contributors interpret this phenomenon as part of a broader neoliberal desire to develop tools for governmental evaluation and accountability; the result is that expanding global governance networks and transnational advocacy groups have turned to metrics to aid their normative and social agendas. One particularly interesting chapter looks at the role that credit-rating agencies have played in recent crises in the eurozone, showing how these agencies not only measure performance but also establish market conventions and trigger points. Other chapters explore the way that rankings focused on corruption and state failure have influenced evolving international norms. But as Snyder trenchantly argues in the conclusion, these indexes and scorecards, although intended as catalysts for transparency and accountability, are often simplistic, laden with normative biases, and easily misused."
20,Economic Interdependence and War,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2015-08-13/economic-interdependence-and-war,Economic Interdependence and War,"Does economic interdependence make states more peaceful or create vulnerabilities that can lead to war? Liberal and realist scholars have long debated this question, agreeing only that the historical record does not lend itself to simple theories. In this landmark book, Copeland argues that these debates have not adequately factored in the expectations of leaders concerning the future trade and investment environment. In some instances, liberals are correct: state leaders have positive expectations about the future and thus see the benefits of keeping the peace and the high costs of war. In other instances, realists get it right: state leaders are pessimistic about the future and fear economic decline and the loss of access to foreign trade and investment, leading them to think that war now is better than submission later. Copeland develops this sophisticated “trade expectations theory” of war and uses it to explore a number of cases of great-power conflict in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries before applying it to contemporary U.S.-Chinese relations. Copeland argues that the optimistic expectations of China’s leaders hinge on their confidence that oil and trade flows will remain open and stable—a mindset that might change in the coming decades if the United States moves toward a policy of containing and economically coercing China."
21,The Paradox of Liberation: Secular Revolutions and Religious Counterrevolutions,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2015-08-13/paradox-liberation-secular-revolutions-and-religious,The Paradox of Liberation: Secular Revolutions and Religious Counterrevolutions,"In this searching meditation on the trajectory of nationalism and politics, Walzer asks why postwar experiments in secular modern democracy have so frequently failed. The book does not offer any sweeping global theories. Instead, Walzer looks closely at three cases: India, Israel, and Algeria. Each achieved independence from colonial powers and statehood through the efforts of elites who wielded a vision of secular modernity. But each has since experienced an erosion of its founding secular, modern principles and institutions and a revival of religious fundamentalism. Walzer argues that lurking in the background of these “liberated” societies are people who never really became fully modern, secular, liberal democratic citizens. The liberating elites passed from the stage, memories faded, and appeals to fundamentalism and conservative religious identity gained power. Ironically, the achievements of democratic politics and modernized political institutions facilitated the mobilization of religious and traditional groups. Walzer searches for ways to salvage secular modern democracy in all three places, concluding that the governments will likely need to forge compromises with their countries’ traditional Hindus, Jews, and Muslims, through which both religious thought and secular institutions will be reformed."
22,"The Global Transformation: History, Modernity and the Making of International Relations",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2015-08-13/global-transformation-history-modernity-and-making-international,"The Global Transformation: History, Modernity and the Making of International Relations","Scholars studying change in international relations during the modern and contemporary eras typically focus on the rise and decline of states and great shifts in the distribution of power. In this important book, Buzan and Lawson argue that this cyclical view of change misses a deeper transformation that unfolded during the nineteenth century and brought the world together into a single system. Capitalism and industrialization increased the world’s “interaction capacity,” bringing peoples and societies into closer contact while creating new divisions and inequalities. Meanwhile, Western nation-states grounded themselves in the rule of law at home while pursuing imperial goals across the globe. These modernizing dynamics propelled the rise of new ideologies, such as nationalism, liberalism, and “scientific” racism, that states used to legitimize their strategies in the game of great-power politics. For Buzan and Lawson, world politics today can be seen as the “downstream consequences” of this nineteenth-century arrival of “global modernity,” and the authors believe that these deep modernizing forces are still at work, ushering in a more “decentered” future in which power will become more diffuse."
23,Why Did Europe Conquer the World?,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2015-08-13/why-did-europe-conquer-world,Why Did Europe Conquer the World?,"Historians have long debated why Europe—a region whose societies in the Middle Ages were generally no more advanced than those in China, Japan, South Asia, and the Middle East—came to dominate the world just a few centuries later. Some have pointed out that unlike most of the world’s regions, which had consolidated into large empires by the 1500s, western Europe, despite periodic bids for “universal monarchy,” remained a fragmented region of competing states. This plural political order helped generate centuries of intra-European competition and war, creating incentives that did not exist elsewhere for innovations in property rights, taxation, and military technology and ultimately leading to rapid increases in state capabilities and huge power asymmetries between Europe and the rest of the world. Hoffman’s fascinating book builds on those insights, arguing that thanks in part to heavy spending on gunpowder, European rulers engaged in a sequence of “winner-take-all tournaments” that led to outsize expenditures on military technology. Hoffman acknowledges that the “ultimate cause” of the European triumph was thus the continent’s political fragmentation, which he sees as the product of “political history.” That, of course, raises a question that he doesn’t quite tackle: What explains political history?"
24,HIV Exceptionalism: Development through Disease in Sierra Leone,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2015-08-12/hiv-exceptionalism-development-through-disease-sierra-leone,HIV Exceptionalism: Development through Disease in Sierra Leone,"Benton’s analysis of the HIV/AIDS crisis in Sierra Leone begins by noting that the disease captures the majority of the resources going to the country’s health-care sector despite the fact that it afflicts only around one percent of the population, which arguably suffers far more from a myriad of other health problems. Benton provides many examples of the counterproductive incentives this imbalance creates within the sector, as many qualified health-care professionals rush into HIV/AIDS work even though far more are needed to help combat malaria and the other diseases that still hold back the people of Sierra Leone, which is still just barely recovering from a long and brutal civil war. The question hovering over the book is whether, in this context, HIV/AIDS is really an “exceptional” ailment that requires exceptional treatment. Benton’s answer leans toward no. Aside from tackling that conundrum, Benton also provides a keenly observed case study of the impact of foreign aid on local practices in very poor countries, when the resource flow is shaped almost entirely by donor priorities rather than local ones."
25,"Water, Civilisation and Power in Sudan: The Political Economy of Military-Islamist State Building",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2015-08-12/water-civilisation-and-power-sudan-political-economy-military,"Water, Civilisation and Power in Sudan: The Political Economy of Military-Islamist State Building","Books on contemporary Sudan tend to focus on the many internal conflicts that have plagued that country, but few explore the nature and policies of the regime in Khartoum. Verhoeven’s book is welcome because it does just that, emphasizing the politics of the regime’s economic development strategies in the last decade or so. The book details Khartoum’s long-standing ambitions to build dams that would help the government leverage the enormous water resources of the Nile River for power generation and agricultural development and also examines the divisions within the government that such projects have inevitably produced. Based on extensive interviews with powerful players in Khartoum and villagers in the countryside, Verhoeven’s book takes a decidedly negative view of the state’s development initiatives. Verhoeven suggests that the benefits have mainly accrued to a small class of urban elites on which the regime relies politically and that the government’s consistent failure to increase food production or extend the benefits of economic growth outside Khartoum is making the broader population restive."
26,Death in the Congo: Murdering Patrice Lumumba,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/death-congo-murdering-patrice-lumumba,Death in the Congo: Murdering Patrice Lumumba,"The story of Patrice Lumumba’s death is fascinating because it seems emblematic of the Cold War–era decolonization of Africa. The tale is now fairly familiar: Lumumba, Congo’s first democratically elected leader, was deposed in a military coup in 1960, imprisoned, and then executed. Complicity was widely shared among the Congolese army’s chief of staff, Joseph Mobutu, who soon consolidated his own power; local authorities in Katanga Province, who hoped to secede; and various Belgian, British, and U.S. agents following more or less direct orders from their capitals. Even the UN, which Lumumba invited into the country to help address the collapse of order, did little to save him. What is distinctive and new in this very readable account is the authors’ unrelentingly negative portraits of all the actors involved. No one emerges unscathed: not the bumbling Congolese, not the Cold War–crazed Americans, not the petulant Europeans—and, worst of all, not even Lumumba himself, whom Gerard and Kuklick portray as a gifted speaker but also a self-promoter who was generally clueless about the exercise of power."
27,Boko Haram: Nigeria's Islamist Insurgency,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/boko-haram-nigerias-islamist-insurgency,Boko Haram: Nigeria’s Islamist Insurgency,"Few people outside Nigeria had ever heard of Boko Haram before the group kidnapped 276 girls from a school in Borno State, in northeastern Nigeria, in April 2014. Since then, the group’s campaign of intense violence against the state and Nigerian civilians has garnered plenty of attention, but its origins are still not well understood. Nor is it clear why efforts to confront the group have proved so ineffective. Comolli’s informative book situates Boko Haram—whose name translates roughly as “non-Islamic education is forbidden”—within the complex history of the various radical Islamist groups that have long existed in the area and explains how the group’s brutality increased after the death of its founder, Mohammed Yusuf, at the hands of Nigerian security forces in 2009. Some observers have worried about Boko Haram’s links to other jihadist organizations and its international ambitions. Although she does not ignore such concerns, Comolli makes a fairly convincing case that Boko Haram is a specifically Nigerian phenomenon and that the group still lacks the determination and the capacity to act far outside Nigeria."
28,Magnificent and Beggar Land: Angola Since the Civil War,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/magnificent-and-beggar-land-angola-civil-war,Magnificent and Beggar Land: Angola Since the Civil War,"This engrossing, authoritative account of Angola’s history since 2002, when its three-decade-long civil war finally ended, explains how a Marxist-Leninist government morphed into one of the most corrupt crony-capitalist regimes in the world. Critical to the story are the profits yielded by the close to two million barrels of oil the country pumps daily, but Soares de Oliveira also emphasizes political and sociological factors. He argues that President José Eduardo dos Santos, a petroleum engineer by training, understands that his ability to remain in power depends in no small part on ensuring his personal control over the national oil company, Sonangol. The commodity boom during the last decade provided huge financial resources to this state within a state, much of which dos Santos distributed to a narrow band of loyal elites by allowing them to profit from massive development and infrastructure projects. The book argues that the recent growth is unsustainable, however, because the regime has done little to promote genuine economic development and because the quality of state institutions outside of the oil sector has withered."
29,Politics and Culture in Contemporary Iran: Challenging the Status Quo,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/politics-and-culture-contemporary-iran-challenging-status-quo,Politics and Culture in Contemporary Iran: Challenging the Status Quo,"This collection consists mainly of contributions by Iranians who have experienced the Islamic Republic firsthand. They were not happy with that experience. They intimate that profound socioeconomic change is under way in Iran that might jeopardize the Iranian theocracy. But they rarely specify the precise nature of the threat; it manifests itself, rather, as an ominous rumble. The chapters cover a wide range of topics, including social media, music, and the relationship between religion and the state. Few of the contributors see hope for internal reform; nor do they suggest other ways that change, violent or otherwise, might come about. In one chapter, however, a reformist and former member of Iran’s parliament, Fatemeh Haghighatjoo, speculates that the vast authority arrogated by Iran’s supreme leader might someday erode or that the current holder of that office, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, might even be succeeded by a multiperson council rather than an individual. The book does not adequately explore a number of other issues that would interest readers less familiar with Iran—for example, President Hassan Rouhani’s efforts to end the country’s long diplomatic isolation or the ways that the authorities allow political factions to organize and express themselves."

The contributors represent the best of Saudi observers, but the editors fail to synthesize their analyses, several of which are standalone gems. One theme that emerges throughout is that since the kingdom’s founding, its rulers have often had a modernizing agenda separate from and sometimes threatening to the Wahhabi religious establishment, especially with respect to the legal system and education. Although disgruntled, the clerics have always buttressed the House of Saud’s claims to legitimacy. None of the chapters directly addresses the origins or trajectory of that agenda, but they do provide fascinating commentaries on a number of critical subjects: the relationship between Wahhabism and Salafism; the state’s role in encouraging, then throttling, the Islamist sahwa (awakening) inspired in the 1960s by the Muslim Brotherhood; and the debate between “classical” and “global” jihadists."
31,‘Iffat al Thunayan: An Arabian Queen,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/iffat-al-thunayan-arabian-queen,‘Iffat al Thunayan: An Arabian Queen,"Iffat al-Thunayan was the wife of King Faisal, who ruled Saudi Arabia from 1964 until 1975, when he was assassinated by a member of the royal family. Thunayan was born in Istanbul but descended on her father’s side from an Arabian family related to Saudi Arabia’s ruling Saud clan; her mother’s lineage included Turks or possibly Circassians. With Faisal, she had five daughters and four sons. The boys all rose to political prominence; one of them, the recently deceased Saud al-Faisal, grew up to become the longest-serving foreign minister in the world, holding the job from 1975 until earlier this year. In Kechichian’s account, Thunayan and Faisal were partners in governing; Thunayan was a driving force, Kechichian argues, in Saudi education and health policy. Thunayan’s life is undoubtedly interesting, but Kechichian, a prolific writer on Saudi Arabia, has produced a work of hagiography instead of biography. In his telling, Thunayan and her husband embodied unfailing sagacity, patience, and love of nation; he has hardly a critical word for either. A more dispassionate approach would have afforded readers a better sense of this power behind the throne."

Neither author foresees its collapse anytime soon, or even in the medium term. Lister mines ISIS’ social media and secondary sources, whereas Cockburn relies on his own firsthand reporting as a correspondent for the Financial Times and The Independent. Lister’s treatment is more satisfying, since he furnishes more empirical evidence, whereas Cockburn engages more in assessment and interpretation. But both books should be taken seriously."
33,Business Groups and Transnational Capitalism in Central America: Economic and Political Strategies,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/business-groups-and-transnational-capitalism-central-america-economic-and,Business Groups and Transnational Capitalism in Central America: Economic and Political Strategies,"A lack of corporate transparency and a paucity of firm-level data frustrate researchers who study business dynamics in the economies of Central America. Nevertheless, the heroic efforts of Bull, Castellacci, and Kasahara have produced some fascinating and often disquieting findings. Contrary to the optimistic hopes of those who support free trade in Central America, opening the region to global commerce has not severed the chummy relations between governments and business groups controlled by powerful families, nor has it generated more competitive and productive business management practices. Although there are important exceptions, many of the region’s leading investors have not chosen to fund export-oriented industries and agricultural innovation but rather have opted for the easy money of retail malls, tourist hotels, and local banking. And despite the evident need for public spending on human capital and physical infrastructure, the idea of paying taxes remains anathema to Central America’s wealthy elites. Meanwhile, frustrated by poorly performing public institutions, voters have been turning away from the traditional political parties, which are heavily influenced by business elites, in favor of antiestablishment candidates. Responding to heightened political risks, corporate conglomerates have diversified their portfolios by investing in several countries simultaneously. And although reliable data on capital flight are hard to come by, it also seems likely that companies are moving some of their money out of the region altogether."
34,21st Century Democracy Promotion in the Americas: Standing up for the Polity,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/21st-century-democracy-promotion-americas-standing-polity,21st Century Democracy Promotion in the Americas: Standing up for the Polity,"The countries of the Western Hemisphere have pioneered regional political institutions—most notably the Organization of American States—as well as collective mechanisms for democracy promotion. Ratified by the OAS’ members in 2001, the Inter-American Democratic Charter codified a set of shared democratic principles but also bound the signatories to the principle of nonintervention in one another’s domestic affairs. There is some tension between those two aspects of the charter, and Heine and Weiffen competently describe the triumphs and frustrations of recent OAS responses to threats to democracy in the region, revealing how hard it is to respond to the gradual deterioration of democratic institutions, particularly when such institutions are vulnerable to wily, democratically elected would-be autocrats. Heine and Weiffen fret over the future of the region’s efforts to defend democracy, citing weaknesses in the structure and design of the OAS and in the political wills of its member states, whose publics and elites have become increasingly fragmented along ideological lines. The authors favor “participatory, social, and inclusive” models, and they repeatedly fault U.S. policy, sometimes heaping blame on Washington for what appear to be collective shortcomings and often downplaying the U.S. role in successful cases of democracy promotion, even in instances when Washington has carefully calibrated its support for OAS strategies."
35,Three Books on Cuba,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2015-08-12/three-books-cuba,Three Books on Cuba,"In his new book, Hayden reflects on a lifetime of political struggles for social justice and more participatory forms of democracy. Listen, Yankee! features conversations between Hayden, a lifelong American political activist and co-founder of Students for a Democratic Society (a progressive group active in the 1960s), and Ricardo Alarcón, a longtime confidant of former Cuban President Fidel Castro. Despite the book’s title, the dominant voice in the discussions is Hayden’s. The book lacks a core thesis and a strong sense of narrative direction and does not adequately explain “why Cuba matters.” But it offers insights into the experiences, perspectives, and historical claims of the New Left that emerged during the 1960s in the United States. Hayden fondly recalls his youthful attraction to the Cuban Revolution (even as he rejects its authoritarian elements), finds fresh hope in the left-leaning democratic governments now common throughout Latin America, and applauds U.S. President Barack Obama’s rapprochement with Cuba, however overdue. Hayden remains deeply critical of “corporate globalization” and mainstream liberals; he harshly judges the foreign policies of both the Carter and the Clinton administrations, for example. But he eschews pessimism. Rather, he appears ready to pass the baton: “Revolutions have similar phases to the human: the bloody eruption of birth, innocence and idealism . . . the responsibilities of power, then decline and atrophy.” For today’s Cuban youth, “the past is ancient history,” as they seek to turn the page on the revolution and usher in a new era."

Obama devoted himself to pulling back and trying to rebuild bridges. Critics argue that the reaction has been overdone and has caused more problems than it has solved. Stephens is one of the administration’s most intelligent and articulate critics, and his book gives its target no quarter. He makes a powerful case for the vices of isolationism and the virtues of a vigorous American global role, arguing that retreat can turn into rout and that disaster can follow on its heels. The dismal experience of Iraq after the withdrawal of U.S. forces is a microcosm of what he fears could happen around the world more generally, and he rails against the increasing number of voices on both sides of the aisle that seem not to realize the danger or not to care. With Russian aggression in Ukraine, Chinese bellicosity in the East China and South China Seas, and the Middle East in turmoil, he has a point. Defenders of the administration will respond that it fully understands that point and that Stephens exaggerates the extent of the recent retreat and the direness of the global situation."
37,The Speechwriter: A Brief Education in Politics,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/speechwriter-brief-education-politics,The Speechwriter: A Brief Education in Politics,"In an elegiac tone that recalls Robert Penn Warren’s classic novel All the King’s Men, Swain’s memoir relates his experiences as a speechwriter for Mark Sanford, the South Carolina governor who, in 2009, told aides that he was hiking the Appalachian Trail when he was actually visiting his mistress in Argentina. Like many politicians, Sanford was no hero to the staffers who knew him best; as Swaim tells it, the governor was self-absorbed to the point of dementia and by turns abusive and dismissive. As a neophyte speechwriter, Swaim struggled to capture and reproduce the vapid grandiosity and unctuous piety of his employer’s natural style. But that was what the public seemed to want, and this memoir is less an account of a politician’s fall than an inquest into mass democracy. American politicians, Swaim suggests, are expected to gush forth industrial quantities of platitudinous, staff-written “language”: letters to constituents, op-eds, speeches at forgettable functions for small-bore interest groups, and so on. What kind of society, Swaim wants readers to ask, insists on these debased effusions of hollow words? His speechwriting days may be over, but Swaim seems to have found his true voice."
38,"Jacksonland: President Andrew Jackson, Cherokee Chief John Ross, and a Great American Land Grab",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/jacksonland-president-andrew-jackson-cherokee-chief-john-ross-and-great,"Jacksonland: President Andrew Jackson, Cherokee Chief John Ross, and a Great American Land Grab","Andrew Jackson dominated the U.S. political landscape between the War of 1812 and his death in 1845; Inskeep’s compelling book offers important insights into Jackson’s legacy and exemplifies the process of reevaluation that has led much of the American left to reject the man whom the historian Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., famously portrayed as the father of American democracy. The “Jacksonland” of Inskeep’s title is the area of the Deep South that the United States seized from Native Americans and Spaniards, mostly under Jackson’s leadership. This is an area that in large part went on to become the core of the so-called Black Belt, where slavery-based cotton agriculture largely defined society. Jacksonland, Inskeep suggests, became a cultural and political, as well as an economic, force, and it still haunts U.S. politics. The book is a detailed account of the doomed efforts of the Cherokee leader John Ross to resist the expulsion of his people from their ancestral homes. It is a harrowing story skillfully told, and Inskeep’s readers will thank him for a balanced account of one of the most fascinating and tragic struggles in U.S. history."
39,The Arab-Israeli Conflict in American Political Culture,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/arab-israeli-conflict-american-political-culture,The Arab-Israeli Conflict in American Political Culture,"In a book that refreshingly avoids offering advice about U.S. foreign policy and the Arab-Israeli dispute, Rynhold offers readers a detailed look at U.S. public opinion on the subject of the Jewish state. He contrasts the views of liberals and conservatives and those of Democrats and Republicans, examines the state of opinion among both mainline and evangelical Protestants, and looks at the state of American Jewish opinion. For the general reader looking for an overview of an important subject, there is no better book to read. The big trends are well delineated: the gradual shift of Israel’s core U.S. support from the left to the right, the sharp increase in sympathy for Israel after 9/11 (an increase that is still felt today), the overall decline of anti-Semitism, the cleavages within the American Jewish community, and the long-standing differences between conservative and liberal Protestants. Rynhold’s analysis of past and present data can’t reveal much about the future, and the relationship between public opinion and national policy is anything but simple, but his analysis suggests that at least for now, there is as much continuity as change in American sentiment toward Israel."

It can limit its commitments and obligations abroad (“Independent America”), become a “Moneyball America” that selectively engages in high-yield, low-risk opportunities, or aim for “Indispensible America” by attempting to uphold the global order through the kind of broad-based global engagement that has typically marked U.S. foreign policy since World War II. In Bremmer’s view, U.S. public opinion is no longer willing to support the “Indispensible” option and much of the rest of the world doesn’t want it. And the “Moneyball” approach demands the kind of cold-blooded realpolitik that U.S. opinion never tolerates for long. In contrast, the “Independent” (neo-isolationist) approach would command support at home and allow the United States to lead by example. Perhaps—but that is what many Americans thought back in the 1930s. To make his case airtight, Bremmer would need to demonstrate more persuasively that U.S. noninvolvement wouldn’t result in another global crisis comparable to the world wars or the Cold War."

This fine book—a fascinating read for the historically-minded—reviews in detail the story of the Great Depression and its remarkable parallels with the crises of the last decade. Fortunately, there were also significant differences, mainly in monetary and fiscal policy, that prevented 2010 from becoming another catastrophic 1933. Policymakers, especially U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Ben Bernanke, drew on the lessons of earlier disasters to frame their policy responses. Eichengreen ingeniously interweaves the two episodes, rather than treating them separately, making manifest the similarities and differences both in market developments and in official reactions. Unlike many treatments of the earlier period, the book covers what happened in Europe as well as what happened in the United States."

Such a pact would provide substantial mutual gains from increased trade. It would also create a framework for settling disputes on issues not covered by the World Trade Organization, of which there are and will continue to be many between these two large trading partners, which have different norms and legal systems. Such an agreement would also facilitate the macroeconomic rebalancing that both countries need. And it would contribute to the overall comity between two nations that too often view themselves as rivals. The book provides a wealth of detail on foreign trade and investment involving China, which is of great interest even independent of the authors’ main argument. It also details the commitments that both countries have already made—and those they have been unwilling to make—in the many trade agreements that have taken shape in recent years."

Hillebrand and Closson’s insightful book sketches eight possible scenarios for what the world might look like in 2050. To impose discipline on the exercise, the authors examine the potential combinations of three distinct dichotomies: high and low economic growth, high and low oil prices, and harmony or disharmony in the global political order. They assume the continuity of the existing, state-dominated global political system but imagine how that system might respond to new threats and take advantage of new possibilities. Not surprisingly, China and the United States play major roles in all eight scenarios, as do technological innovation and energy policy. Some scenarios are more plausible than others. The most likely to take shape in the real world, the authors argue, are two that feature high economic growth and global disharmony: one in which oil prices are high and the other in which they are low. In both situations, the United States and its allies would be challenged by an assertive China but would retain the upper hand, the Middle East would continue to be troublesome, and India would thrive."
44,The Globalization of Inequality,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/globalization-inequality,The Globalization of Inequality,"Bourguignon, a former World Bank chief economist, presents a thoughtful and judicious analysis of economic inequality, considering the phenomenon in both developed and developing countries, examining its likely consequences, and suggesting some possible remedies. After growing steadily since 1820, global inequality has declined markedly since 1990, even while income and wealth inequality within most countries have increased. The explanation for this apparent paradox is that poor countries, most notably populous China and India, have grown more rapidly than have rich countries. Both developments can be attributed in part to globalization, but also in part to technological changes that have, among other things, permitted much larger audiences for entertainment and cultural products, resulting in highly compensated superstars in sports, music, and movies. The book is highly accessible yet also sophisticated, drawing on a large and growing technical and empirical literature on inequality."
45,The Age of Sustainable Development,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2015-08-12/age-sustainable-development,The Age of Sustainable Development,"Sachs offers an impressive panoramic view of how the world reached its current condition: prosperous by historical standards, but at the expense of extensive ecological damage and potentially adverse changes in the climate. The book makes use of material Sachs prepared for a massive global online course on sustainable development. It addresses the complicated challenge of assuring a continued rise in prosperity, particularly in the remaining poor parts of the world, while avoiding roadblocks such as the depletion of fresh water, extensive air and water pollution, the loss of biodiversity, and excessive climate change. It provides a clear and cogent nontechnical survey of the world’s major challenges beyond the preservation of peace and security."

On its latest balance sheet, Apple showed assets of $261 billion, including $8.7 billion of “intangibles,” such as the positive views of the company held by consumers and investors. In recent months, the U.S. stock market has valued Apple at around $720 billion; the reasons for the gap between the company’s balance-sheet valuation and its market capitalization are intangible, too, in a sense. Coca-Cola has one of the world’s most valuable brands and counts $26 billion of the $91 billion in assets on its balance sheet as intangible; that, too, is far exceeded by the company’s market capitalization of around $170 billion. Much of the accumulated wealth in the world’s leading economies takes this undefined form."
47,An Unworthy Ally,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/pakistan/unworthy-ally,An Unworthy Ally,"Ever since 9/11, the United States has provided Pakistan with a steady supply of security and nonsecurity assistance. U.S. officials have justified these generous transfers—worth more than $30 billion since 2002—on the grounds that they secure Pakistan’s ongoing cooperation in Afghanistan, bolster Pakistan’s ability to fight terrorism, and give the U.S. government influence over the country’s ever-expanding nuclear weapons program. Failing to deliver this support, the argument runs, could dramatically weaken the will and capacity of Pakistan’s security forces and possibly even lead to the collapse of the Pakistani state. In that event, Pakistan’s nuclear know-how, material, or weapons could well fall into the hands of nefarious actors."

During a festival at the ancient temples of Angkor, he and Sam Rainsy ate together from a gigantic cake of sticky rice weighing more than four metric tons—a Guinness World Record. It was an uncanny scene, not least because the last time Sam Rainsy had made a major public appearance at Cambodia’s most glorious site, in September 2013, it was to call Hun Sen a cheat and a usurper."
49,The Meaning of Kissinger,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2015-08-18/meaning-kissinger,The Meaning of Kissinger,"There are reasons other than his longevity why so many world leaders—among them the Chinese President Xi Jinping—continue to seek the counsel of Henry Kissinger, who stepped down as U.S. secretary of state close to four decades ago. In this respect, Barack Obama is unusual. He is the first U.S. president since Dwight Eisenhower not to seek Kissinger’s advice. Periodically, commentators urge Obama to be more “Kissingerian.” Others argue that he is Kissinger­ian in practice, if not in rhetoric. But what exactly does the term mean?"
50,Withholding Judgment,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/united-states/withholding-judgment,Withholding Judgment,"As the United States grew from a small set of colonies into a global hegemon, so did the geographic reach of its laws. From civil law to criminal law to human rights law, U.S. statutes now govern activity in every corner of the globe. Indeed, as recent news attests, soccer officials in Europe, cybercriminals in China, and multinational corporations operating in Africa are well within the United States’ legal cross hairs. As a result, the judges charged with interpreting U.S. laws have become crucial players in the exercise of American power."
51,City Century,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/world/city-century,City Century,"Although history is not usually taught this way, one could argue that cities have played a more important role in shaping the world than empires. From Athens and Rome to Paris and Venice to Baghdad and Beijing, urban ideas and innovators have left indelible marks on human life. By concentrating the brainpower of humanity in relatively small geographic areas, cities have promoted the kinds of interactions that nurture creativity and technological advances. They have been the drivers of progress throughout history, and now—as the knowledge economy takes full flight—they are poised to play a leading role in addressing the challenges of the twenty-first century."

Local health and political leaders did not know of the presence of the hemorrhagic fever virus in the 35,000-square-mile Guinea Forest Region, and no human cases had ever been identified in the region prior to the outbreak. Its appearance in the tiny Guinean village of Meliandou in December 2013 went unnoticed, save as a domestic tragedy for the Ouamouno family, who lost their toddler son Emile to a mysterious fever. Practically all the nonbiological aspects of the crisis, however, were entirely unsurprising, as the epidemic itself and the fumbling response to it played out with deeply frustrating predictability. The world has seen these mistakes before."
53,The Scholar as Secretary,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/interviews/2015-09-01/scholar-secretary,The Scholar as Secretary,"Ashton Carter has an unusual background for a secretary of defense. Before assuming the United States’ top  military post in February, he studied medieval history and particle physics as an undergraduate at Yale, got a Ph.D. in physics as a Rhodes scholar at Oxford, and taught international affairs at Harvard. He also served as an assistant secretary of defense in the Clinton administration and as an undersecretary and then the deputy secretary of defense under President Barack Obama. Since becoming secretary, Carter has displayed an unusual bluntness, openly criticizing Iraq’s military forces and talking tough to adversaries such as China and Russia. In his first full-length print interview since becoming secretary, Carter met with Foreign Affairs managing editor Jonathan Tepperman in his Pentagon office in early July."
54,Obama and Terrorism,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/obama-and-terrorism,Obama and Terrorism,"U.S. President Barack Obama came into office determined to end a seemingly endless war on terrorism. Obama pledged to make his counterterrorism policies more nimble, more transparent, and more ethical than the ones pursued by the George W. Bush administration. Obama wanted to get away from the overreliance on force that characterized the Bush era, which led to the disastrous U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003. That war, in turn, compromised the U.S. campaign against al Qaeda. During the past six-plus years, Obama has overseen an approach that relies on a combination of targeted killing, security assistance to military and intelligence forces in partner and allied countries, and intensive electronic surveillance. He has also initiated, although in a tentative way, a crucial effort to identify and address the underlying causes of terrorism. Overall, these steps amount to an improvement over the Bush years. But in many important ways, the relationship between Bush’s and Obama’s counterterrorism programs is marked by continuity as much as  by change."
55,Obama and Africa,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/africa/obama-and-africa,Obama and Africa,"When Barack Obama was elected U.S. president in 2008, the news was greeted with enormous hope in sub-Saharan Africa, as well as among the small coterie of Americans who follow the region closely. This son of a Kenyan father would not only understand the continent better than his predecessors in the White House, the thinking went, but he would also treat it as a strategic priority and direct more resources its way. At the time, it didn’t seem far-fetched to predict that Obama would usher in a new era of improved U.S.-African relations. Even though President George W. Bush had substantially increased aid to Africa, anti-Americanism there had grown under his watch, the result of opposition to his unilateralist foreign policy."
56,Obama and Latin America,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/americas/obama-and-latin-america,Obama and Latin America,"In April 2009, just three months after he took office, U.S. President Barack Obama traveled to Trinidad and Tobago for the Summit of the Americas. There, he told Latin America’s leaders that he wanted to begin “a new chapter of engagement” and an “equal partnership . . . based on mutual respect and common interests and shared values.” Most dramatically, he pledged to seek “a new beginning with Cuba,” which had not enjoyed diplomatic relations with the United States for five decades."
57,Obama and Europe,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/europe/obama-and-europe,Obama and Europe,"Even now, gazing back through the jaundiced lens of subsequent experience, Barack Obama’s 2008 campaign speech in Berlin still seems an extraordinary occasion. Tens of thousands of mostly young Germans gathered in the center of the city to listen to the American presidential candidate, in an atmosphere The Guardian described as “a pop festival, a summer gathering of peace, love—and loathing of George Bush.” Streets were closed for the occasion. Bands played to warm up the crowd."
58,Obama and Asia,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/asia/obama-and-asia,Obama and Asia,"China’s rise poses two broad challenges for U.S. foreign policy: how to deter the People’s Republic from destabilizing East Asia and how to encourage it to contribute to multilateral global governance. Although China is not yet a military peer competitor of the United States, it has become powerful enough to challenge U.S. friends and allies in East Asia and to pose serious problems for U.S. forces operating there. And although China is still a developing country with significant domestic problems, it has become an important enough actor that its cooperation is necessary to solve global problems such as nuclear proliferation, climate change, and international financial instability."
59,Obama and the Middle East,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/middle-east/obama-and-middle-east,Obama and the Middle East,"Critics of U.S. President Barack Obama’s Middle East strategy often complain that Obama lacks a strategic vision. This is almost exactly wrong. Obama came to office with a conviction that reducing the United States’ massive military and political investment in the Middle East was a vital national security interest in its own right. The occupation of Iraq and the excesses of the war on terrorism had left the United States overextended, especially at a time of economic crisis. “Rightsizing” the United States’ footprint in the region meant not only reducing its material presence but also exercising restraint diplomatically, stepping back and challenging allies to take greater responsibility for their own security. Obama has adhered consistently to this strategy, prioritizing it ruthlessly along the way and firmly resisting efforts to force it off track. This was not a strategy much beloved in Washington or in a region hard-wired for the exercise of American power. But it was a clear and coherent strategy that led Obama to undertake major initiatives on the problems he viewed as rising to the level of core national security interests: Iran’s nuclear weapons program, terrorism, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and the war in Iraq."
60,What Obama Gets Wrong,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/what-obama-gets-wrong,What Obama Gets Wrong,Gideon Rose’s intriguing essay on President Barack Obama’s foreign policy raises a vexing question: When does the statute of limitations on blaming President George W. Bush for the record of the current administration finally expire?
61,What Obama Gets Right,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/united-states/what-obama-gets-right,What Obama Gets Right,"How should one judge a president’s handling of foreign policy? Some focus on what happens in a few lonely moments of crisis, casting the nation’s leader as Horatius at the bridge or Casey at the bat. But a better analogy would be a member of a relay team or a middle relief pitcher: somebody who takes over from a predecessor, does a hard job for a while, and then passes things on to the next guy. In baseball, there are special statistics used to judge such players, the hold and the blown save, which essentially tally whether the pitcher’s team keeps or loses the lead while he’s in the game. Looked at in such a light, Barack Obama has done pretty well. Having inherited two wars and a global economic crisis from the George W. Bush administration—the foreign policy equivalent of runners on base with no outs—Obama has extricated the country from some old problems, avoided getting trapped in some new ones, and made some solid pickups on the side. There have been errors, wild pitches, and lost opportunities. But like George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton, Obama will likely pass on to his successor an overall foreign policy agenda and national power position in better shape than when he entered office, ones that the next administration can build on to improve things further. Given how many administrations fail even that limited test, such an accomplishment is worthy of praise rather than the contempt the administration’s foreign policy often receives. The key to Obama’s success has been his grasp of the big picture: his appreciation of the liberal international order that the United States has nurtured over the last seven decades, together with his recognition that the core of that order needed to be salvaged by pulling back from misguided adventures and feuds in the global periphery. The president is variously painted as a softheaded idealist, a cold-blooded realist, or a naive incompetent. But he is actually best understood as an ideological liberal with a conservative temperament—somebody who felt that after a period of reckless overexpansion and belligerent unilateralism,  the country’s long-term foreign policy goals could best be furthered by short-term retrenchment. In this, he was almost certainly correct, and with the necessary backpedaling having been accomplished, Washington can turn its attention to figuring out how to get the liberal order moving forward once again."
62,Restoring America’s Strength,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2015-08-04/restoring-america-s-strength,Restoring America’s Strength,"America’s status as the greatest and most influential nation on earth comes with certain inescapable realities. Among these are an abundance of enemies wishing to undermine us, numerous allies dependent on our strength and constancy, and the burden of knowing that every choice we make in exercising our power—even when we choose not to exercise it at all—has tremendous human and geopolitical consequences."

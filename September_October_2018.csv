0,World War Web,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/issue-packages/2018-08-14/world-war-web,What’s Inside,"History is filled with supposed lost utopias, and there is no greater cliché than to see one’s own era as a lamentable decline from a previous golden age. Sometimes, however, clichés are right. And as we explored the Internet’s future for this issue’s lead package, it became clear this was one of those times. Contemplating where we have come from digitally and where we are heading, it’s hard not to feel increasingly wistful and nostalgic."
1,Postwar Europe and the Eurovision Song Contest,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2018-08-13/postwar-europe-and-eurovision-song-contest,Postwar Europe and the Eurovision Song Contest,"The Eurovision Song Contest, founded in 1956, is an annual televised pop extravaganza in which bands from dozens of countries compete before a live audience. Commentators often dismiss the cavalcade of three-minute songs as pure kitsch: recent winners include a Romanian Dracula singing in falsetto, a bearded Austrian drag queen, and a Finnish heavy-metal band clad in monster suits. Yet nearly 200 million Europeans tune in. Vuletic goes beneath the bubblegum to reveal surprising machinations. National broadcasters established Eurovision not to promote cosmopolitan ideals but to provide cheap content, and the competition tends to stoke national pride more than collective identity. Central European authoritarians spend vast sums to host it, thereby whitewashing their countries’ meager domestic freedoms, and many governments occasionally rig the selection of national entries to push political agendas. The countries with the five biggest media markets automatically make it to the last round every year—a practice that has led Turkey to withdraw in protest. And the final tally is skewed by the tendency of spectators to favor bands from neighboring countries. Yet after more than 50 years, Eurovision not only lives on but has become ever more tolerant and diverse. Europe would not be the same without it."
2,EuroTragedy: A Drama in Nine Acts,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2018-08-13/eurotragedy-drama-nine-acts,EuroTragedy: A Drama in Nine Acts,"In this book, the best history of the recent eurozone crisis yet to appear, Mody argues that the euro is dysfunctional “because it defies the principles of economics.” Monetary unions can work well only if inflation and employment rates converge, or if, as in the United States, mass migration, government transfers, and budgetary restrictions offset economic differences. None of this exists in the eurozone, so the monetary union has depressed growth, undermined the legitimacy of the EU, and exacerbated inequality. That is conventional wisdom, but Mody also makes a more original and disturbing contribution by demonstrating that European leaders knew all of this decades ago. They ignored the warnings of most economists, central bankers, EU officials, and even some politicians that the euro could do little good and colluded to whitewash official reports and suppress bad economic data. Mody recounts this history in admirable detail, yet his economic expertise is of little help in explaining why European leaders chose such an ill-fated course. That is perhaps because he passes over the exporters, bankers, wealthy citizens, senior citizens, debt-prone governments, and other politically powerful groups that benefit, at least in the short term, from the single currency."
3,The Good Mothers: The True Story of the Women Who Took on the World’s Most Powerful Mafia,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2018-08-13/good-mothers-true-story-women-who-took-worlds-most-powerful-mafia,The Good Mothers: The True Story of the Women Who Took on the World’s Most Powerful Mafia,"Perry tells the tale of three women who turned on the ’Ndrangheta, the Calabrian Mafia. Despite persistent efforts by the police to incriminate Mafia leaders using high-tech surveillance, organized crime remains powerful in southern Italy, accounting for almost four percent of the Italian economy. Few will testify against the ’Ndrangheta because the costs of informing are so high. Two of the three female informants ended up dead, despite powerful witness protection programs. One was lured to a rendezvous by her former husband, ostensibly to discuss their daughter’s college plans, then kidnapped and tortured to death by his two brothers. The second collaborator was eventually coaxed back to see her children and died after drinking hydrochloric acid. (The family claimed she had committed suicide.) The third recanted under family pressure, then agreed to testify after all, resulting in long jail sentences for 34 members of her family and their associates, including her father. Alessandra Cerreti, the enterprising prosecutor who developed the strategy of turning women against their criminal clans, now lives under around-the-clock police guard and travels only by armored car. By necessity, she and her husband have no children."
4,The History of the European Migration Regime: Germany’s Strategic Hegemony; Migration and Refugee Policies in Germany: New European Limits of Control?,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2018-08-13/history-european-migration-regime-germanys-strategic-hegemony,The History of the European Migration Regime: Germany’s Strategic Hegemony; Migration and Refugee Policies in Germany: New European Limits of Control?,"In 2015, civil wars in countries near the Mediterranean led refugees to flood Europe. Almost alone, Germany welcomed them, until over one million had arrived and all European countries tightened their borders. Germany has dominated Europe’s collective arrangements for governing migration for almost 70 years. Comte shows that it does so because it has always absorbed the most migrants, both from European countries, such as Italy, and from outside neighbors, such as Turkey. France and Italy, by contrast, have been more reticent, and the United Kingdom, protected by the English Channel, has vacillated. Since the 1970s, as Comte recounts, in response to slower growth and rising numbers of migrants, European governments have clamped down on illegal immigration by low-skilled laborers while allowing better-educated immigrants to enter lawfully and move about freely, mainly to promote economic exchange and foreign investment in Europe."
5,Hitler and Film: The Führer's Hidden Passion,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2018-08-13/hitler-and-film-fuhrers-hidden-passion,Hitler and Film: The Führer’s Hidden Passion,"Hitler’s passion for art, architecture, and Wagnerian opera is common knowledge. Yet the Führer was, above all, a film addict. In the years before World War II, he watched two or three movies a night, including all of those released in Germany. Although he personally financed, selected, and often censored films shown in public theaters and attended public screenings that were selected to cultivate popular support, his private tastes ranged far more broadly. He adored Mickey Mouse, often watched sophisticated works by Jewish émigré directors and with Jewish actors, and even viewed American, British, and French films in their original languages. Even more than his propaganda minister, Joseph Goebbels, he took responsibility for Nazi publicity. He approved every German newsreel before its release and sponsored not just Leni Riefenstahl’s famous works but also films advocating the forced sterilization of the disabled and anti-Semitic ethnic cleansing. The latter were shown to people who were tasked with the extermination of the Jews. These events took place 75 years ago, but they contain lessons for today: tyrants are often surprisingly ordinary people, and state control over the media plays an essential role in creating and sustaining dictators."
6,Good Fences Make Good Politics,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/review-essay/2018-08-13/good-fences-make-good-politics,Good Fences Make Good Politics,"The rise of right-wing populism in the West is the story of our time. In the United States and western Europe, recent years have seen antiestablishment parties and candidates win unprecedented electoral victories by casting themselves as defenders of their nations against the twin threats posed by foreigners and a corrupt elite. The two major shocks to the international order in recent years—Brexit and the election of Donald Trump as U.S. president—were both manifestations of this larger trend."
7,"A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies, and Leadership",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2018-08-13/higher-loyalty-truth-lies-and-leadership,"A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies, and Leadership","It is hard to know who hates Comey, the former fbi director, more: partisans of the Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, who blame her defeat in the 2016 presidential election on Comey’s decision to announce the reopening of an FBI investigation into her conduct days before the vote, or supporters of U.S. President Donald Trump, who see the former FBI director as part of a sinister “deep state” conspiracy against the Trump administration. In Comey’s own telling, he was an honest but unlucky man of old-fashioned principles who was forced to make fast decisions in a hyperpartisan atmosphere. Yet those principles were of little help in the wild world of Washington, where, based on Comey’s evidence, both Democrats and Republicans engaged in grave misconduct. Obama administration officials pressured him to downplay the seriousness of the FBI's investigation into Clinton’s use of a private e-mail server. Later, Comey had a one-on-one dinner with Trump that he describes as akin to an evening with a creepily insistent Mafia don. Throughout, Comey seems to have been out of his depth. But in times like these, many people struggle to keep their feet."
8,War on Peace: The End of Diplomacy and the Decline of American Influence,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2018-08-13/war-peace-end-diplomacy-and-decline-american-influence,War on Peace: The End of Diplomacy and the Decline of American Influence,"Farrow is a gifted writer and a sharp observer, and parts of this book are brilliant, especially its account of Farrow’s service under Richard Holbrooke, who was U.S. President Barack Obama’s special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan. But the book’s parts do not cohere. Farrow argues that U.S. diplomacy is being crowded out by military thinking and compares the current situation to the dominance of shortsighted military planners during the Vietnam War. He reports that Holbrooke, in dealing with U.S. policy toward Afghanistan, found himself making the same arguments against the same counterinsurgency military strategies that he had argued against in the Vietnam era. Yet that very comparison undercuts the idea that the subordination of diplomatic to military thinking is something new. At times, the book reads like a memoir of Farrow’s education in statecraft; at times, it becomes a lament for a bygone era of diplomats who maintained strong personal relations with some rather horrible figures in the interest of diplomacy; at times, it is an attack on the U.S. government for collaborating too closely with Afghan warlords and Egyptian generals. Material for several first-rate books is scattered throughout the pages of War on Peace; Farrow will be heard from again."

Abramowitz uses political science to analyze the electorate, Wuthnow takes a sociological perspective on the residents of the small towns that voted disproportionately for Trump, and Zito and Todd use a mixture of journalistic interviews and demographic analysis to understand Trump voters."
10,"Peacekeeping in Africa: Politics, Security, and the Failure of Foreign Military Assistance",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2018-08-13/peacekeeping-africa-politics-security-and-failure-foreign,"Peacekeeping in Africa: Politics, Security, and the Failure of Foreign Military Assistance","As Western countries have come to rely on African militaries to carry out peacekeeping operations, a complex web of training facilities for peacekeepers and programs to improve cooperation between armed forces has emerged, mostly funded by Western donors. At the core of this system are a small number of training centers. In this book, Jowell, a former analyst at the International Peace Support Training Center in Kenya, uses officer-training programs as a lens through which to analyze the logic and effectiveness of peacekeeping. The picture is not pretty, but it is instructive. Curricula at training centers are poorly designed. Participants are often attracted more by the stipends they receive and by opportunities for career advancement and foreign travel than by a desire to learn. Western donors pump in a great deal of money, but they show little concern about the low quality of the training. Yet Jowell shows that despite all these shortcomings, these training centers are creating a pan-African military ethos by forging international networks of officers with shared experiences and a common language."
11,Money for Votes: The Causes and Consequences of Electoral Clientelism in Africa,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2018-08-13/money-votes-causes-and-consequences-electoral-clientelism-africa,Money for Votes: The Causes and Consequences of Electoral Clientelism in Africa,"Kramon’s study of electoral patronage in Kenya represents a valuable addition to the burgeoning literature on political competition in Africa. The conventional wisdom holds that African politicians often buy voters’ support with cash payments or other perks. For that to work, however, politicians would have to be able to monitor individual votes; otherwise, people might take the money but then vote their conscience. And in fledgling democracies with poorly organ-ized political parties, the ballot is likely to be secret, as parties are often too weak to monitor individual votes. Yet politicians continue to disburse large sums even without any obvious way to confirm that they’ll get what they’ve paid for. Kramon estimates from his surveys of Kenyan voters that the average candidate for Parliament in Kenya’s 2007 elections spent $48,000 on handouts. Kramon’s ingenious solu-tion to this puzzle is that offering such handouts should not be thought of as buying votes at all; politicians instead spend money to signal to voters that they will be generous to their constituencies if elected: a handout from a candidate is more like an initial deposit on a future payment than a quid pro quo. As evidence, Kramon shows a positive correlation between pre-election hand-outs and post-election development spending across Kenyan constituencies."
12,Robert Mugabe,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2018-08-13/robert-mugabe,Robert Mugabe,"This excellent short biography of former Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe covers his life from Zimbabwe’s independence, in 1980, to his ouster last year in a military coup. Mugabe devoted his entire adult life to politics, first as the ascetic and ruthless leader of a nationalist independence movement, a period during which he spent much time in prison, and then as the triumphant ruler of a new nation. Once in power, he at first surprised observers with his magnanimity toward his erstwhile enemies, leaving the economic power of whites largely untouched. But in the 1990s, when the Zimbabwean economy declined, Mugabe turned to a racially tinged populism; his seizure of white farmers’ land led directly to the collapse of the economy but allowed him to reward his rural base, whose support kept him in power. Onslow and Plaut make clear that Mugabe’s approach to power was always autocratic and repressive, and they sharply note the gap between his Marxist rhetoric and the vast personal riches he amassed and his enormous corruption."
13,The Art of Creating Power: Freedman on Strategy,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2018-08-13/art-creating-power-freedman-strategy,The Art of Creating Power: Freedman on Strategy,"Pulling together the vast corpus of Lawrence Freedman’s work is an ambitious feat, but this book manages it with aplomb. The contributors tackle his wide-ranging scholarship on topics such as strategy, deterrence, military policy, and international relations. Freedman, a regular contributor to this magazine, is the author of a canonical text on nuclear weapons, The Evolution of Nuclear Strategy. After the 9/11 attacks, he pushed the international community to reconsider its understanding of deterrence to accommodate the threat of terrorism. In the years that followed, Freedman’s work on humanitarian intervention and just war theory shaped how policymakers and politicians, such as British Prime Minister Tony Blair, approached the Iraq war—although many of them misapplied Freedman’s thinking. Freedman later served as a key member of the British government’s official inquiry into the United Kingdom’s role in the war. Attempts by the contributors to this volume to view Freedman’s work through various theoretical lenses are less interesting than their substantive analysis of his thought, but this study reminds readers that Freedman has earned his status as a towering figure among scholars and practitioners of military strategy."
14,Africa’s Lost Leader: South Africa’s Continental Role Since Apartheid,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2018-08-13/africas-lost-leader-south-africas-continental-role-apartheid,Africa’s Lost Leader: South Africa’s Continental Role Since Apartheid,"In 1994, with the end of apartheid and the introduction of majority rule, most observers believed that South Africa was destined to become a regional hegemon, given its large economy and its highly professional and well-equipped army. Hamill carefully explains why South Africa’s international standing has instead waned over the last two decades. Thanks to the apartheid state’s history of bullying and military intervention in southern Africa, the new democratic government was reluctant to take on an explicit leader-ship role in the region. In recent years, the country’s stagnant economy and poor governance have limited its attractiveness as a role model and its ability and willingness to exercise influ-ence. Hamill also emphasizes the sharp decline of the South African armed forces, after years of neglect and underfunding. Military spending has dropped from 4.4 percent of gdp in the final years of white minority government to just one percent today, sharply reducing South Africa’s ability to project power beyond its borders."
15,Rwanda: From Genocide to Precarious Peace,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2018-08-13/rwanda-genocide-precarious-peace,Rwanda: From Genocide to Precarious Peace,"Despite a steady supply of books about the Rwandan genocide of 1994, there exist remarkably few serious studies of the regime that emerged from the devastation, led by President Paul Kagame. Under Kagame, Rwanda has become a darling of international donors and has consistently received more foreign aid per capita than most other developing countries. Media reports often laud the government’s focus on economic development—Rwanda has boasted an average annual growth rate of eight percent since 2001—and describe its autocratic tendencies as unfortunate but understandable given the country’s history and continuing security concerns. Thomson offers a much more complex analysis, revealing how the regime continues to define itself in relation to the genocide and that, as a result, it has never quite escaped the logic of ethnic partisanship. The Kagame government, in her account, is a dictatorial police state that systematically favors a narrow stratum of urban Tutsi elites at the expense of the rest of the population. The government’s backers argue that ensuring rapid economic growth will inoculate the country against ethnic conflict, but Thomson suggests that resentments are mounting below the surface, as growth has only modestly reduced poverty and dramatically increased inequality."

(They now reside at Stanford University’s Hoover Institution.) Lin’s passionate, literate, and penetrating cellblock writings form the basis for Lian’s moving account of her tragic life. In the early years of Mao’s rule, Lin was an enthusiastic communist. But she fell afoul of the leadership during the Hundred Flowers movement, when intellectuals were invited to criticize the Chinese Communist Party. She “resisted reform” through long periods of ostracism and imprisonment, eventually reconverting to Christianity, her family’s religion. She was tortured in prison by guards who handcuffed her for long periods, exposed her to freezing temperatures, and left her in solitary confinement. As her letters wavered between clarity and delirium, her jailers accused her of “madly attacking, abusing, and slandering [the Chinese Communist] party and its leader.” After Lin’s death, her grave became a pilgrimage site for pro-democracy activists, and in 2004, the Chinese independent filmmaker Hu Jie made a documentary about her."

Q. Khan, the brilliant engineer who guided the development of Pakistan’s nuclear weapons program and then sold the technology to Iran, Libya, and North Korea. Khan was a fervent patriot, a Muslim nationalist, an anti-Semite, an anti-American, and an overweening egoist. He proliferated nuclear technology both to spread his ideology and to satisfy his intense greed. Islamabad eventually labeled him a rogue proliferator, but along the way, he had many enablers. In the 1950s, the U.S. Atoms for Peace program built the foundation for Pakistan’s nuclear establishment. Western universities trained the scientists who later joined Khan’s team. European companies supplied him with components. Pakistani military and political leaders collaborated with Khan or turned a blind eye to his activities. Even today, Khan remains a national hero in Pakistan and lives under the protection of the government. Abbas’ diligent scrutiny of public sources and his intimate knowledge of Pakistani politics make this the most authoritative study yet written of Khan’s complicated story."
18,Recent Books on Nuclear Strategy,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2018-10-15/recent-books-nuclear-strategy,Recent Books on Nuclear Strategy,"Ever since the United States dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, no nuclear weapons have been used in combat. This limits all efforts to develop theories about nuclear strategy, as does the fact that serious nuclear crises have been few and far between. Those who worry that something will go badly wrong one day can point to some close calls but no catastrophes. The Cuban missile crisis looms large in all such discussions, yet that confrontation was the product of a particular set of circumstances and of the approaches adopted by the main protagonists, U.S. President John F. Kennedy and Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev. In his study of nuclear superiority, Kroenig notes that both men thought that the appearance of having greater strength mattered. As evidence, he points to how the public’s belief in the “missile gap”—the claim that the Soviet Union had more and better missiles than the United States—influenced the two countries’ politics and policies, even though, in the end, the assertion proved false."

Successive South Korean presidents have oscillated between attempts to punish North Korea and efforts to befriend it. The United States has also shifted between punitive and conciliatory approaches to Pyongyang, but it has often been out of sync with Seoul. Pyongyang has usually kept the initiative, shifting from provocations to talks and back again, always in search of concessions. Today, as well as mediating between Pyongyang and Washington, South Koreans are also debating how to balance a rising China against an unpredictable United States. Even though South Korea is one of the world’s richest and best-armed countries, autonomy remains frustratingly out of reach. If South Korea loses faith in the U.S. alliance, Snyder warns, it may well align with China."
20,The New ASEAN in Asia Pacific and Beyond,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2018-08-13/new-asean-asia-pacific-and-beyond,The New ASEAN in Asia Pacific and Beyond,"The ten member states of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations use the phrase “ASEAN centrality” to express the idea that the region’s fate should be decided chiefly by them, and not by outside powers such as China, India, Japan, or the United States. That is an elusive goal given the organization’s institutional weakness. Although the group has issued numerous declarations and adopted a charter, its members have committed themselves to little more than constant meetings. ASEAN was unable to resolve the Asian financial crisis of 1997–98, prevent human rights violations in Cambodia and Myanmar, or stop Indonesian farmers from polluting the air across the region by burning forests. Yet as Narine’s nuanced survey shows, ASEAN has forced outside powers to pay more attention to the region’s collective interests than they would have done if the organization did not exist. And as great-power relations continue to shift, ASEAN may yet prove a force to be reckoned with."
21,Japan's Population Implosion: The 50 Million Shock,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2018-08-13/japans-population-implosion-50-million-shock,Japan’s Population Implosion: The 50 Million Shock,"Japan’s birthrate of 1.43 children per woman, which is far below the level necessary to replace the current population, is causing the country to age and its economy to falter. As the country’s welfare needs grow, the government’s capacity to meet them is declining. Smaller cities can no longer afford to pay for adequate public services, pushing young people to move to a few big cities, such as Tokyo, and stranding older people in solitary environments. Today, Japan is a major power of 127 million people who enjoy high living standards; by the end of this century, it could be a minor power of 50 million people who are relatively poor. This book, by a panel of experts, recommends that the government let older people work longer and that it protect the vitality of select smaller cities by encouraging business investment and improving access to health care, education, and other public services. The book’s contributors also urge the government to offer economic incentives to couples to have more children and create policies to improve people’s work-life balance. Such steps, they argue, might prevent the population from falling below around 80 million by the end of the century. But the authors refrain from suggesting major changes to Japan’s restrictive immigration policies. They seem to believe that Japanese society is too homogeneous to absorb foreigners as readily as other big developed countries do."
22,On Grand Strategy,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2018-08-13/grand-strategy,On Grand Strategy,"This illuminating and erudite book explores the meaning of grand strategy by recounting some of history’s most fateful decisions, many of which were also its most ill conceived. Often these involved attempts at conquest: the Persian king Xerxes’ invasion of Greece in 480 BC, Philip II of Spain’s abortive invasion of England in 1588, and Napoleon’s assault on Russia in 1812. Gaddis defines “grand strategy” as aligning “potentially unlimited aspirations with necessarily limited capabilities” and highlights the persistent error of focusing on the former while ignoring the latter. He frequently cites the philosopher Isaiah Berlin’s distinction, borrowed from the ancient Greek poet Archilochus, between the fox, who knows many things, and the hedgehog, who knows one big thing. The best strategists, Gaddis suggests, combine both attributes: they focus on overarching goals but respond pragmatically to circumstances. To make his point, he draws on a range of thinkers, including Thucydides, Machiavelli, Clausewitz, and Tolstoy. One surprise is that the period about which Gaddis has written most extensively—the Cold War and the nuclear age—is absent. Gaddis says he feels he has written enough on the subject, but this reader could have coped with a little more from the master of the field."
23,Social Value Investing: A Management Framework for Effective Partnerships,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2018-08-13/social-value-investing-management-framework-effective,Social Value Investing: A Management Framework for Effective Partnerships,"Buffett and Eimicke draw on examples of successful public-private partnerships (as well as some not-so-successful ones) to explain how policymakers should go about designing them. Such projects are rising in popularity as cash-strapped governments often find themselves unable to finance even traditional public services, let alone desirable new ones, and private actors—philanthropists, nongovernmental organizations, and businesses—are able to bring useful knowledge and skills as well as funds to bear on social problems. Buffett and Eimicke recount partnerships that rejuvenated parks in Chicago and New York City, upgraded the technology used by the New York City Fire Department, digitized social services in India, and improved farming practices in Herat Province, in Afghanistan. They draw lessons from these examples on how best to structure such partnerships, set practical timelines, and involve local people and groups."

The first addresses the facts of globalization using a series of useful indexes and maps to depict levels of trade, travel, investment, and other international economic activities. Ghemawat uses these facts, along with projections of the future, to debunk what he calls “globalony”: assertions by businesspeople about how corporations should respond to globalization, such as the idea that a truly global company should have no home base. The second half of the book offers practical guidelines to help international companies make decisions about whether to invest in particular countries. Ghemawat bases his recommendations, in part, on the distance between the country in question and the company’s home—measured not only in geographic terms but also in terms of language and culture. Executives, he warns, should consider each potential new market carefully and critically. Ghemawat aims his advice at businesspeople (and business students), but his work will also enlighten readers outside the business world who want to understand international trade and investment."
25,Unelected Power: The Quest for Legitimacy in Central Banking and the Regulatory State,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/unelected-power-quest-legitimacy-central-banking-and-regulatory-state,Unelected Power: The Quest for Legitimacy in Central Banking and the Regulatory State,"Tucker’s thoughtful disquisition on democracy in modern societies focuses on the relationships between citizens and various branches of the state. The last quarter of the book covers the structure of independent central banks and how much authority should be delegated to them—in normal times and in emergencies, such as the financial crisis of 2007–8. Tucker draws heavily on the history of the Bank of England, where he worked as a regulator for 30 years, but he also discusses other central banks, including the U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank. In Tucker’s view, to retain legitimacy and credibility, independent agencies must operate transparently and must enjoy clearly defined powers. For central banks, these involve setting monetary policy, regulating and supervising the banking system, serving as the lender of last resort, and carrying out some less common policies in emergencies, such as quantitative easing. Tucker’s work is full of valuable insights for central bankers as well as their critics."
26,Brave New Arctic: The Untold Story of the Melting North,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2018-08-13/brave-new-arctic-untold-story-melting-north,Brave New Arctic: The Untold Story of the Melting North,"Serreze has written a highly personal account of his experience as an environmental scientist researching the high Arctic, in particular the shrinkage of Arctic ice over the last 35 years. Although the amount of melting varies significantly from year to year, and only some of the reasons for the variation are understood, Serreze shows that the Arctic, including Greenland, is thawing at a much faster rate than was expected even a decade ago. Serreze details the growing knowledge about what is happening in the region, the puzzles scientists face in interpreting their observations, and the interplay between new data and climate models. His analysis will prove particularly valuable to budding scientists by illuminating how collaboration and cross-fertilization take place among scientists of different backgrounds, how scientists decide when to publish results, their continuing need to acquire more data, and how they fund research and expeditions."
27,The Infinite Desire for Growth,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2018-08-13/infinite-desire-growth,The Infinite Desire for Growth,"Cohen has produced a breathtaking overview of the history and evolution of humanity and human society—and a sobering essay on the future of civilization. He points out that modern Western civilization draws heavily on the eighteenth-century Enlightenment (which drew, in turn, on earlier intellectual and scientific developments) but that writers of that period emphasized the moral improvement of humans rather than the accumulation of wealth. The celebration of the latter began largely in the twentieth century, during which people in the West and around the world came to want and expect continuous improvements in their material well-being, based on economic growth. Yet as Cohen notes, thanks to a growing global population, itself the result of improved economic conditions, sustained economic growth is testing the limits of the planet’s resources. What is more, after a certain point, growth fails to make people happier because they measure their circumstances against those of their neighbors and, as methods of communication improve, against those of ever more distant people."
28,Us vs. Them: The Failure of Globalism,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2018-08-13/us-vs-them-failure-globalism,Us vs. Them: The Failure of Globalism,"This quick survey of today’s geopolitical trends and hot spots features a straightforward thesis: the world is in turmoil, and globalization is to blame. Nations are turning inward, people are becoming tribal, zero-sum thinking is on the rise, and the project of building an open international order is failing. Bremmer acknowledges that globalization has not been all bad. It has stimulated decades of economic growth and lifted much of humanity out of poverty. But he argues that its more profound impact has been to generate economic insecurity, undermine social solidarity, and usher in an era of backlash politics. The axis of political conflict is no longer between the left and the right or between the West and “the rest”; it is between elites and aggrieved, fearful people seeking protection from foreigners, economic competition, and technological change. Globalization has unsettled not just the United States and Europe but also the developing world, including countries such as Brazil, Mexico, and Turkey. Bremmer sees all countries facing a stark choice: either they “build walls” or they renew the bargains between citizens and their governments in ways that allow both sides to better navigate a world of growing interdependence."
29,Boundaries of the International: Law and Empire,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2018-08-13/boundaries-international-law-and-empire,Boundaries of the International: Law and Empire,"Theorists of modern international law typically trace its origins to the rise of the European state system in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. In this narrative, European countries, which saw one another as sovereign and equal, forged legal principles to regulate their relations and later exported those principles to the rest of the world. Pitts complicates this story by illuminating the ways in which international law was an artifact of empire, a system for organizing the world so as to perpetuate Western dominance. In the late eighteenth century, when universalistic conceptions of law took hold, discourses on international law often specified universal ideals that would unite the “civilized world” as a moral community. But notions of universalism and equality tended to mask exclusionary, Eurocentric thinking. It was the “law of nations” that justified territorial conquest, the seizure of foreign ships, and the imposition of discriminatory trade regimes. Later, in the twentieth century, international law aided those struggling against empires and for self-determination. So in the end, international law proved both a tool of the powerful and a weapon of the weak."

In an earlier book, Bloodlands, Snyder told the story of Nazi and Soviet genocidal violence in eastern Europe in the 1930s and 1940s. In his new work, Snyder argues that fascism and authoritarianism have returned in new and subtler guises. For Snyder, the primary threat comes from Russia’s ideological challenge to the West. The West’s grand vision is built on Enlightenment ideas and a belief in the inevitable spread of liberal democracy. Snyder argues that this “politics of inevitability” has collapsed, opening the door to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s “politics of eternity,” a project in which illiberal states perpetuate themselves by manufacturing enemies, stoking grievances, manipulating the truth, and undermining foreign countries that offer alternative ideals to their citizens. Snyder’s lyrical prose gives the book its emotional power. What is missing is a sense of what stands in oppo-sition to this illiberal onslaught. What political and ideological tools can the liberal democratic world use to resist the politics of eternity?"
31,How We Got the Iran Deal,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/united-states/how-we-got-iran-deal,How We Got the Iran Deal,"In the international negotiations that resulted in the 2015 agreement to limit Iran’s nuclear activities, I led the team of American diplomats representing the United States. During the talks, my Iranian counterparts would occasionally ask how they could be assured that any deal we struck would be durable. Most Republicans opposed it, and looking at the forthcoming 2016 U.S. presidential election, the Iranians wondered what would happen if the GOP took the White House. I would answer by asking them a similar question: “What if hard-liners opposed to the deal regained power in Iran?” It usually ended the discussion, as I thought it should: after all, I always expected that the greatest challenge to the deal’s success would be violations by Iran, not the political machinations of the president of the United States."

Looking back today, a decade after the crisis, there is every reason to agree with Bernanke’s assessment: 2008 should serve as a warning of the scale and speed with which global financial crises can unfold in the twenty-first century."

As justification, he cites the need for national unity in an increasingly uncertain security environment. Western-style democracy, he argues, is neither necessary nor inevitable; the country needs a strong leader and a government with distinctive national characteristics. To counter the influx of Western values, he rehabilitates Confucianism, once shunned as the root of the country’s backwardness. In the West, meanwhile, observers lament this political regression, wondering why economic growth has not led to political liberalization; some argue that the country represents a new model of development."
34,The Internet’s Lost Promise,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/world/2018-08-13/internets-lost-promise,The Internet’s Lost Promise,"In the United States, Russia sought to help one presidential candidate over another in the 2016 election—not only through hacking and the release of e-mails but also through an extensive information operation that included paid ads, fake social media accounts, and divisive content. In China, authorities are harnessing the power of artificial intelligence to perfect an Orwellian system of online and real-world surveillance to track citizens’ every move. In Myanmar, a UN rapporteur found that Facebook had helped spread hate speech, contributing to the ethnic cleansing of Rohingya Muslims. At a time when fully half of the world’s population is connected to the Internet, it is hard to escape the conclusion that the technology that promised to give power to the powerless has ended up also hurting the very people it was supposed to help."
35,Three Cheers for Trump’s Foreign Policy,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/world/2018-08-13/three-cheers-trumps-foreign-policy,Three Cheers for Trump’s Foreign Policy,"Donald Trump’s victory in the 2016 U.S. presidential election heralded nothing less than certain catastrophe. At least, that was and remains the firm belief of “the Blob”—what Ben Rhodes, a foreign policy adviser in the Obama administration, called those from both parties in the mainstream media and the foreign policy establishment who, driven by habitual ideas and no small amount of piety and false wisdom, worry about the decline of the U.S.-led order. “We are very probably looking at a global recession, with no end in sight,” the New York Times columnist Paul Krugman forecast after Trump’s victory. Others prophesied that Trump would resign by the end of his first year (Tony Schwartz, the co-author of Trump: The Art of the Deal), that he would be holed up in the Ecuadorian embassy in six months (the liberal commentator John Aravosis), or that the United States might be headed down the same path that Germany took from the Weimar Republic to the Third Reich. That last warning came from former U.S. President Barack Obama last December at the Economic Club of Chicago, where he invoked the specter of Nazi Germany. “We have to tend to this garden of democracy or else things could fall apart quickly,” he said. “Sixty million people died, so you’ve got to pay attention—and vote.”"

From the early 1970s to the first decade of this century, the number of electoral democracies increased from about 35 to more than 110. Over the same period, the world’s output of goods and services quadrupled, and growth extended to virtually every region of the world. The proportion of people living in extreme poverty plummeted, dropping from 42 percent of the global population in 1993 to 18 percent in 2008."

Hamilton’s investigative reporting reveals the flows of Chinese money to Australian politicians and institutions and the connections of prominent Chinese Australians to Chinese intelligence agencies. Hamilton argues that Australia’s open society, multicultural values, tradition of international collaboration in scientific research, and economic dependence on Chinese exports, tourists, and students leave the country ill equipped to resist large-scale, coordinated Chinese influence and espionage efforts. Many Australians do not even comprehend the extent of the problem. Hamilton dubs numerous Australian politicians, academic administrators, and media personalities “apologists and appeasers” for China and pushes back against charges of racism by arguing that it is Beijing, not he, that expects all ethnic Chinese to pitch in for the motherland regardless of their citizenship. The book has sparked controversy in Australia, and the government has begun to make policy changes intended to protect Australian democracy."
38,Battlefield Internet,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/world/2018-08-14/battlefield-internet,Battlefield Internet,"Cyberspace has been recognized as a new arena for competition among states ever since it came into existence. In the United States, there have long been warnings of a “cyber–Pearl Harbor”—a massive digital attack that could cripple the country’s critical infrastructure without a single shot being fired. Presidential commissions, military task force reports, and congressional investigations have been calling attention to such a risk for decades. In 1984, the Reagan administration warned of the “significant security challenges” of the coming information age. And just this year, Dan Coats, the director of national intelligence, said of such threats, “the lights are blinking red.”"
39,Radical Arab Nationalism and Political Islam,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2018-08-13/radical-arab-nationalism-and-political-islam,Radical Arab Nationalism and Political Islam,"This provocative book argues that in Europe, the nation-state emerged after centuries of violent experimentation, but that in the Arab world, that process was inverted: first came the states, and then came the messy experiments. In the immediate postcolonial period, Arab states quickly formed. Arab nationalists tried to create strong governments by centralizing power and depriving their citizens of all autonomy. That approach failed, and by the 1970s, Islamists, inspired by the theologians Abul Ala Maududi and Sayyid Qutb, offered an alternative vision that valued individuals—but only as members of the Islamic community, the ummah. Neither movement had any use for social sciences, which Addi argues are vital to nation building. In Addi’s view, modern economic life promotes individualism and secularization. In the Arab world, that process will take a long time. Yet Addi does not take the prospect of a revived Islamist caliphate seriously, nor does he believe the Arab world will drift into illiberal democracy, as has happened in Russia and Turkey."
40,Inside the Arab State,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2018-08-13/inside-arab-state,Inside the Arab State,"In this useful synthesis, Kamrava reviews the best empirical studies and theoretical analyses of political transitions in middle-income countries to illuminate the recent trajectory of the Arab world. The uprisings of 2011 marked a “critical juncture,” he argues, in which citizens called into question entrenched institutional arrangements. The possibility for revolutionary change was real, Kamrava claims. But he offers no all-encompassing explanation for why such change mostly failed to arrive. He argues that the era of larger-than-life leaders in the Arab world has ended and presents interesting data from a 2016 public opinion survey of Arab citizens that showed a strong preference for democracy and disillusionment with existing parliaments and parties. Overall, Kamrava sees the events of 2011 as more analogous to the start of the long period of democracy building that began in Europe in 1848 than to eastern Europe’s rapid transitions after 1989."
41,The House of Islam: A Global History,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2018-08-13/house-islam-global-history,The House of Islam: A Global History,"Husain offers a layman’s, not a theologian’s, understanding of Islam. As a young man, he immersed himself in Salafism, the literalistic and puritanical interpretation of Islam spread by Saudi Arabian proselytizers and funded by the country’s petrodollars. Later, he rediscovered Sufism, a faith and culture that he estimates has been adopted by around 80 percent of Muslims over the religion’s 1,400-year history. Sufism embraces music, dance, poetry, and sex as aspects of the quest for God. It respects other faiths and accepts human frailty. Husain believes the Salafists and other orthodox extremists have hijacked Islam. He has founded a think tank, Quilliam, to help more moderate Muslims win it back. It is not clear whether Husain’s engaging treatise is aimed at Muslims or non-Muslims, but he evidently thinks that Muslims are primarily responsible for the emergence of extremism in their communities. There is an urgent question underlying the book: Is Salafism an aberration from a religion characterized by tolerance, reason, and agency for women, or is it the tip of an iceberg of literalism, sexism, and violence? Husain clearly believes the former, although he does not address the question in detail."
42,Democratic Transition in the Muslim World: A Global Perspective,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2018-08-13/democratic-transition-muslim-world-global-perspective,Democratic Transition in the Muslim World: A Global Perspective,"In 2011, protesters in Tunisia and Egypt overthrew their autocratic leaders and demanded sweeping economic and political reforms. Yet since then, the two countries have seen very different outcomes. Tunisia has built a shaky democracy; Egypt has sunk back into authoritarianism. Several of the essays in this collection set out to understand why. One contributor, Rached Ghannouchi, the leader of Tunisia’s Islamist party, Ennahda, explains its history of cooperating with other parties. After the revolution, Ennahda advocated a system of proportional representation, preventing itself from winning national elections outright and provoking a backlash from “the deep state,” precisely the mistake that Egypt’s reformers later made. Ghannouchi’s successful pragmatism stands in contrast to the clumsiness of Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi, who was deposed in 2013, just a year after taking office, following widespread protests. Tunisia was also helped by its tradition of civilian control of the military, whereas in Egypt, things were the other way around. Finally, Tunisia took an extended period to write its constitution; Egypt did a rushed job. Despite its subtitle, the collection does not consider every part of the Muslim world (although it does get beyond the Middle East, with fine chapters on democracy in India and Indonesia). Nevertheless, it is an important and often original work."

From its origins as a small Pentagon program to its status as a global platform that connects more than half of the world’s population and tens of billions of devices, the Internet has long been an American project. Yet today, the United States has ceded leadership in cyberspace to China. Chinese President Xi Jinping has outlined his plans to turn China into a “cyber-superpower.” Already, more people in China have access to the Internet than in any other country, but Xi has grander plans. Through domestic regulations, technological innovation, and foreign policy, China aims to build an “impregnable” cyberdefense system, give itself a greater voice in Internet governance, foster more world-class companies, and lead the globe in advanced technologies."

The Threat From Within,"This account of Israel’s drift to the political right over the last few decades avoids sensationalism and reveals that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, contrary to his image abroad, is one of the more liberal figures in the country’s main right-wing political alliance, the Likud Party. Carlstrom depicts Israel as a society riven by bitter tribalism, where “incitement and racism [have become] a regular feature of political discourse.” The book echoes a speech given by Israeli President Reuven Rivlin in 2015, in which he decried the zero-sum warfare over public budgets, subsidies, and other government handouts that divides Israel’s Ashkenazi, Mizrahi, and Haredi Jews, as well as its Arab, Ethiopian, and Russian citizens. Israel will survive the bickering, but its Jewish citizens may become separated from Jews elsewhere as they increasingly place Jewish identity above democracy. Two-thirds of Jewish Israelis believe that the two-state solution is dead. The forces advocating annexation of the West Bank are ascendant. If sacrificing democracy is the price, many feel, so be it."

Thompson, America’s Man in Cold War Moscow; From Cold War to Hot Peace: An American Ambassador in Putin’s Russia","Llewellyn Thompson served eight U.S. presidents as a diplomat, including two stints as U.S. ambassador to the Soviet Union. This rigorously documented book by his two daughters recounts his four decades as a Foreign Service officer. He was first posted to the Soviet Union in 1941, as an official in the U.S. embassy in Moscow, and then served as the U.S. ambassador from 1957 to 1962, an event-ful period that saw, among other things, the launch of Sputnik, the Berlin crisis, the downing of an American U-2 spy plane, and U.S. President John F. Kennedy’s meeting with Nikita Khrushchev in Vienna. The years after Thompson’s return to Washington were equally dramatic. He was involved in the Cuban missile crisis, the escalating Vietnam War, and U.S.-Soviet arms control talks. The authors draw from fresh sources to treat these events in great detail, which results in a valuable addition to the history of the first half of the Cold War, as well as a compelling biography of their father."
46,The Vory: Russia’s Super Mafia,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2018-08-13/vory-russias-super-mafia,The Vory: Russia’s Super Mafia,"Gangsters turn up in every society, but the shape they take and the ways in which they operate depend to a great extent on the culture and politics of their countries of origin and change with the times. As this comprehensively researched book shows, nowhere is that more true than in Russia. Galeotti starts by describing the different kinds of crime that plagued imperial Russia, focusing on the contrast between the countryside (where banditry, poaching, and horse thievery were most common) and the rapidly swelling cities, with their slums, gangs, and criminal underworlds. After the Russian Revolution of 1917, the nature of the country’s crime changed, as Stalin’s gulag produced new criminal clans led by the vory v zakone, or “thieves in law.” The law in question was the strict code by which they ruled themselves and related to the rest of society. The vory set themselves apart from the civilian world with dramatic tattoos and elaborate jargon—which has found its way into the thuggish language employed by contemporary Russian politicians, including President Vladimir Putin. After Stalin’s death, these gangs were eclipsed by a new underworld that adapted to the opportunities presented by each successive era. Today, mob bosses wear three-piece suits and slip between criminal and legal business, often in collusion with the state. Much of their activity takes place beyond Russia’s borders with foreign partners from China and the United States."

On board was the novelist Ivan Goncharov, who wrote a wildly popular travelogue describ-ing the adventure. Bojanowska takes apart Goncharov’s account like a precious timepiece, examining each component to reveal a different side to Russia’s entry into the age of imperialism. Sensitive to Goncharov’s artistry, she balances his admiration for British colonial administrators and the lessons he took from them for his own government as it colonized the Caucasus and Siberia with his visceral national pride in the “humanity” Russia brought to its own “civilizing mission.” The result is a splendid exposition of the ways in which, from the 1850s onward, Russia’s history, like that of Belgium, France, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom, was shaped by the process of colonization."

A former KGB officer, entrepreneur, government official, head of Russian Railways, and, at times, member of President Vladimir Putin’s circle, he is now on the U.S. government’s sanctions list. Yet readers expecting a self-justifying screed will be surprised. Yakunin comes across as flinty, intelligent, self-critical, and rather idealistic as he describes the time he spent in New York as an intelligence agent in the 1980s, the start of his business career, his first meeting with Putin, and the challenges he faced in completing massive port projects in Russia during President Boris Yeltsin’s administration. His account of the turbulent times after the collapse of the Soviet Union illuminates the profound complexity of managing new state-controlled firms such as Russian Railways, which has a million employees and 150 “daughter companies.” Yakunin has produced a multidimensional memoir and a portrait of contemporary Russia that features many more shades of gray than the simplistic versions common in Western media."
49,Orbán: Hungary’s Strongman,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2018-08-13/orban-hungarys-strongman,Orbán: Hungary’s Strongman,"Lendvai’s tautly argued, baleful account of the career of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban will correct anyone who once harbored the illusion that eastern European countries—free of Soviet control and comfortably ensconced in the EU and NATO—would move rapidly toward liberal democracy. Thanks in no small part to Orban, Hungary’s trajectory since the fall of communism bears far more resemblance to that of Russia under President Vladimir Putin than to, say, Spain’s after the death of the dictator Francisco Franco. The parallels between Orban and Putin go beyond a shared authoritarian streak. Orban’s calculated shift from democrat to nationalist and from liberal dissident to the guardian of Hungary’s most conservative values mirrors Putin’s evolution from reformer to hard-liner. True, Orban’s three political near-death experiences, including two consecutive electoral defeats, set him apart from Putin. But Orban’s political skill, tenacity, and lack of scruples make him a remarkably similar politician."

For readers unfamiliar with Peruvian politics, The Neighborhood, which recounts a fictionalized version of Montesinos’ machinations, is an entertaining introduction to the era’s multilayered, exquisitely Machiavellian plots. But the book also shows why Vargas Llosa, a Nobel laureate in literature, has his share of detractors in his home country. The novel renders Peru as a place with few redeeming traits. He freely appropriates recent Peruvian history but gives it a false twist: in his story, a single, vengeful journalist from the tabloid press undoes the corrupt, increasingly authoritarian regime of Montesinos and his president, Alberto Fujimori. In the more compelling, if more complex, real life events, the regime was toppled by the combined efforts of Peruvian civil society groups, the mainstream media, and a number of international organizations and foreign governments."

In this book, a group of economists uncover several interconnected causes for the malaise: the high cost of energy, inadequate infrastructure, burdensome regulatory systems, and violent crime. Perhaps most damaging is a persistent brain drain, which has depleted the stock of highly educated workers. On the upside, remittances from émigrés often exceed direct investment and official development assistance. One particularly innovative chapter concludes that so-called economic citizenship programs, which allow wealthy foreigners to purchase citizenship and, in some cases, residency in Caribbean countries, provide significant benefits to the countries that offer them, despite the risk that they will be used to launder money. A concluding chapter argues that unleashing growth will require a combination of policies and greater regional coordination to avoid a “race to the bottom” (for example, by competing to offer tax breaks to foreign investors). Whether governments have the institutional capacity and political will to adopt and sustain the necessary reforms remains unclear."

Extensive industrial supply chains and a booming two-way trade in agricultural products bind the two countries’ economies together. Mexican filmmakers, athletes, and celebrity chefs enrich U.S. popular culture. And national law enforcement agencies cooperate to suppress criminal organizations that operate on both sides of the border. Within Mexico, a large, prosperous middle class has emerged. The two countries are no longer “distant neighbors,” as the journalist Alan Riding dubbed them in the pre-NAFTA 1980s; they are “intimate strangers—deeply connected to each other yet with few of the tools [they] need to understand [their] growing intimacy.” Before the rise of U.S. President Donald Trump, many Americans and Mexicans viewed their countries’ strengthening bonds favorably. But as a candidate, Trump successfully played on the fears of voters in small towns and rural areas. Despite Trump’s victory, Selee is confident that the irresistible forces of integration will only accelerate and Trump’s anti-Mexican posture will prove a mere footnote to history."

The 64-year-old president-elect of Mexico, who will begin his six-year term on December 1, is a polarizing personality. He is adored by his admirers, who are especially numerous among the indigenous and working poor, and feared by many in the upper reaches of Mexican society. After a successful stint as the mayor of Mexico City from 2000 to 2005, López Obrador ran two losing campaigns for the presidency, in 2006 and 2012, before his victory this July. Ortiz Pinchetti, a longtime close collaborator of López Obrador’s, offers a compelling personal portrait of the president-elect and a point-by-point retort to his detractors. In Ortiz Pinchetti’s telling, López Obrador is admirably hard working and austere. He is pragmatic yet consistent in his strong ethical principles and his moderate social democratic philosophy. His heroes include U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt and Chilean President Salvador Allende; he is not an admirer of the Cuban dictator Fidel Castro or the Venezuelan strongman Hugo Chávez. Nor does he harbor the visceral anti-Americanism common among Latin American leftists. Ortiz Pinchetti provides an empathetic but indispensable source for understanding López Obrador’s political trajectory, his style of politics, and his aspirations."

Some economists who once extolled the virtues of free trade and the free flow of capital now point out that globalization has brought smaller gains than were once claimed, while destroying working-class jobs and communities. The American public’s views of foreign trade have grown more positive as the U.S. economy has recovered from the Great Recession, but in 2014, according to a poll by the Pew Research Center, only 20 percent of Americans thought that trade created new jobs, and just 17 percent believed that it raised wages.

Apple, originally a computer manufacturer, now runs the world’s largest mobile app store in terms of revenue, with about 80 percent of the market, and the second-largest music streaming business, approaching a third of the market. And Amazon captures close to every other dollar spent online in the United States. These companies are what the economist David Autor calls “superstar firms,” able to gain huge market shares and translate their market power into enormous profits."
56,Can Mexico Be Saved?,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/americas/2018-08-14/can-mexico-be-saved,Can Mexico Be Saved?,"In 2012, Mexico’s future looked promising. The election of a dashing young president, Enrique Peña Nieto, imbued the country with a new sense of energy and purpose. Back in power after a 12-year hiatus, the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, had promised to reinvent itself and shun the corrupt authoritarianism it had practiced during the seven decades it ruled Mexico. As the country seemed to reach a consensus on long-delayed structural reforms, the international press heralded “the Mexican moment.” According to the cover of Time magazine, Peña Nieto was “saving Mexico” by opening up the energy sector to foreign investment, combating monopolies, changing archaic labor laws, and leaving nationalism and crony capitalism in the past."
57,Muslim Brothers,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/review-essay/2018-08-14/muslim-brothers,Muslim Brothers,"Seven years since the heady days of early 2011, when massive, electrifying protests brought down the Egyptian dictator Hosni Mubarak, the political atmosphere in Egypt has turned somber. In 2013, General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi overthrew President Mohamed Morsi, a leader of the Muslim Brotherhood who had narrowly won Egypt’s first free presidential election the prior year. Since seizing power, Sisi has emptied the country of any real politics. His crackdown against the Muslim Brotherhood has been particularly brutal: he has jailed tens of thousands of Brothers, and designated the group a terrorist organization. On the regional stage, Egypt has found itself relegated to second-tier status. What was once the center of the Arab world today feels like a ghost of its former self."
58,Regulate to Liberate,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/europe/2018-08-14/regulate-liberate,Regulate to Liberate,"Regulations to protect personal data don’t inspire much love. Companies frequently regard them as a nuisance, a needless expense, and a hindrance to innovation. Governments think the rules should apply to everyone but themselves. And ordinary people often act as if they don’t care whether their data is safeguarded at all."
59,The New Arab Order,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/middle-east/2018-08-14/new-arab-order,The New Arab Order,"In 2011, millions of citizens across the Arab world took to the streets. Popular uprisings from Tunis to Cairo promised to topple autocracies and usher in democratic reforms. For a moment, it looked as if the old Middle Eastern order was coming to an end and a new and better one was taking its place. But things quickly fell apart. Some states collapsed under the pressure and devolved into civil war; others found ways to muddle through and regain control over their societies. Seven years later, those early hopes for a fundamental, positive shift in Middle Eastern politics appear to have been profoundly misplaced."
60,The Unconstrained Presidency,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/united-states/unconstrained-presidency,The Unconstrained Presidency,"In the age of Donald Trump, it often feels as though one individual has the power to chart the United States’ course in the world all by himself. Since taking office as U.S. president, Trump has made a series of unilateral decisions with enormous consequences. He walked away from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the Paris agreement on climate change, and the Iran nuclear deal. He imposed tariffs on Canada, China, Mexico, and the European Union. In June, he single-handedly upended the G-7 summit by insulting Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and withdrawing the United States from the group’s joint communiqué. In July, his European travels produced more diplomatic fireworks, with a NATO summit in Brussels that raised questions about his commitment to the organization—before his deferential press conference with Russian President Vladimir Putin."
61,Data to the People,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/asia/2018-08-13/data-people,Data to the People,"Data, the techno-optimists are fond of saying, is the new oil. It is the fuel of the modern economy, a valuable commodity that can be bought and sold, and a strategic resource for nations. Indeed, digital assets now matter far more than physical ones. As the writer Tom Goodwin has pointed out, “Uber, the world’s largest taxi company, owns no vehicles. Facebook, the world’s most popular media owner, creates no content. Alibaba, the most valuable retailer, has no inventory. And Airbnb, the world’s largest accommodation provider, owns no real estate.” As with oil in another era, the market today has generously rewarded those who have best captured data. In 2006, three of the world’s six most valuable public firms were oil companies, and just one was a technology company. By 2016, only one oil company remained in the top six. The rest were tech giants."

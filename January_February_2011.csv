3,Talking To Hamas,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/middle-east/2011-01-01/talking-hamas,Talking To Hamas,"Daniel Byman (""How to Handle Hamas,"" September/October 2010) correctly argues that peace between Israel and the Palestinians via a two-state solution requires the involvement and acceptance of Hamas. However, he overstates the difficulty of securing Hamas' agreement to a cease-fire and understates the problem of gaining Israel's agreement. Moreover, although Byman acknowledges the importance of Palestinian reconciliation, he does not identify a key reason for its failure."
4,Culture Matters,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/americas/2011-01-01/culture-matters,Culture Matters,"Nearly two centuries after the countries of Latin America gained their independence from Spain and Portugal, not one of them is truly developed. Where have they gone wrong? Why have countries in other regions, once far behind, managed to achieve relatively quickly results that Latin American countries have aspired to for so long?"
5,Museveni's Uganda: Paradoxes of Power in a Hybrid Regime; The Lord's Resistance Army: Myth and Reality,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2011-01-01/musevenis-uganda-paradoxes-power-hybrid-regime-lords-resistance,Museveni’s Uganda: Paradoxes of Power in a Hybrid Regime; The Lord’s Resistance Army: Myth and Reality,"After he came to power in 1986, Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni was hailed by the Washington establishment as part of Africa's ""new breed"" of leaders for his ability to restore stability to Uganda and achieve both political liberalization and economic growth. But his reputation has slowly eroded. As Tripp makes clear in her thoughtful study of the regime, the real, if limited, democratic progress of the 1990s has stagnated and in some cases been reversed. The government has committed serious human rights abuses, intimidated the press and the opposition, and become increasingly corrupt. Her most interesting argument is that Uganda's economic success and increases in foreign aid lessened the incentives for the regime to implement the political reforms it had promised. Instead, like many other African governments, it has sustained itself in an uneasy equilibrium of semiauthoritarian rule -- a hybrid that combines the trappings of democracy, such as regular multiparty elections and a tolerated opposition, with regular abuses of power to emasculate that opposition and ensure the regime's hold on power."
6,Successes in African Agriculture: Lessons for the Future,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2011-01-01/successes-african-agriculture-lessons-future,Successes in African Agriculture: Lessons for the Future,"Per capita food production has declined across Africa for most of the postcolonial period, and exporters of cash crops have lost market share to Asian producers. These failures matter because a majority of Africa's poor still derive their incomes from agriculture. As the editors of this collection of insightful essays note, foreign aid to African agriculture has been cut in half since the early 1990s, the victim of changing donor fashions, and African governments too often neglect the needs of small-scale agriculture. Given the pervasive sense of failure in the sector, the book's novel approach is to examine success stories -- the introduction of improved varieties of cassava in central Africa and maize in southern and eastern Africa, cotton production in Mali, and the horticultural export booms in Côte d'Ivoire and Kenya. In each case, the authors credit agricultural research, technological breakthroughs, and incentives that increased productivity. In a sense, these insights are nothing new, which raises the question of why funding for African agricultural research has remained so woefully inadequate."
7,Pirate State: Inside Somalia's Terrorism at Sea,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2011-01-01/pirate-state-inside-somalias-terrorism-sea,Pirate State: Inside Somalia’s Terrorism at Sea,"In the aftermath of the collapse of Somalia's central government in the early 1990s, the country has been engulfed in economic decay, lawlessness, and violence, as warlords compete for control of the few remaining sources of revenue. For a long time, these developments remained a local story that did not interest the Western public, but the combination of rising Muslim fundamentalism in the area and the emergence of piracy in the busy shipping lanes of the Gulf of Aden changed that. The attempt by Somali pirates to highjack the U.S. ship the Maersk Alabama in 2009 was featured prominently on cable news and introduced the Somalia problem to the American public. Eichstaedt's book tries to respond to this new interest, with a breezy account that, despite its often melodramatic prose and occasional lack of careful analysis, is often informative. Somali fishermen, he argues, turned to piracy when they found foreign fleets taking advantage of Somalia's anarchy to fish directly off the coast. The fishermen reacted to the challenge by holding passing ships for ransom. A journalist, Eichstaedt is most readable when he describes the way piracy is organized. The loosely structured and ill-disciplined small networks of young men that initially characterized Somali piracy have been overtaken by Somali warlords, including members of the Islamic fundamentalist militia al Shabab."
8,Famine and Foreigners: Ethiopia Since Live Aid,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2011-01-01/famine-and-foreigners-ethiopia-live-aid,Famine and Foreigners: Ethiopia Since Live Aid,"Ethiopia's economy is one of the fastest growing in the world, even though Ethiopia remains one of the poorest countries in the world. Its strongman prime minister, Meles Zenawi, is a darling of the West, and his country is now one of the world's largest recipients of aid, taking in some $3 billion a year. Gill, in his sympathetic account of Ethiopia's last three decades, largely ignores broad economic trends and rarely mentions statistics, instead structuring his narrative around the country's recurrent droughts and famines and the international community's efforts to help avert future catastrophes. He has crisscrossed the country since the mid-1980s, and his book includes compelling vignettes of Ethiopians doing their best to improve desperate conditions and of donor organizations grappling with the country's complexities. Gill's account of the Meles government is generally positive, although his tone is never explicitly judgmental. A thoughtful chapter on the failed elections of 2005 makes clear the repressive nature of the regime, but it also seems to take seriously the government's view of greater democratization as a dangerous frivolity."
9,Living With the Dragon: How the American Public Views the Rise of China,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2011-01-01/living-dragon-how-american-public-views-rise-china,Living With the Dragon: How the American Public Views the Rise of China,"Public opinion provides U.S. policymakers with what the scholar Daniel Yankelovich called the ""boundaries of the permissible."" Page and Xie argue that these boundaries -- they call them ""dikes"" -- help account for Washington's basically stable China policy from Richard Nixon to Barack Obama. Americans give primacy to security and then economic concerns, wanting to pursue goals related to human rights and democratic transformation only to the extent that doing so is not too costly. ""Caricatures of an ignorant American public,"" Page and Xie conclude, "". . . have been grossly exaggerated."" Indeed, Americans have generally articulated more stable and moderate policy-relevant views of China than has Washington discourse. The U.S. public has consistently supported engagement, economic cooperation, and leadership exchanges. Cooperative by inclination, Americans are paying close attention to whether or not China becomes more reassuring as its power grows. ""Most Americans,"" Page and Xie write, ""are prepared to live peacefully and cooperatively with the Chinese dragon."" Living With the Dragon has multiple virtues: clearly stated conclusions, balance, voluminous data crisply presented, and policy relevance."
10,In Defense of Japan: From the Market to the Military in Space Policy,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2011-01-01/defense-japan-market-military-space-policy,In Defense of Japan: From the Market to the Military in Space Policy,"In a shift little noticed outside professional military circles, in the last decade Japan has quietly developed a suite of cutting-edge military space technologies -- rockets, satellites, and spacecraft -- that were originally designed for commercial applications. The subject of this book is highly technical: the list of acronyms is 14 pages long, and some passages are hard going for a nonspecialist. But the bottom line is clear enough: Japan's capabilities are widely underestimated, all the more so in space. The strategic logic for Japan's space program is obvious, with a growing naval, space, and nuclear power across the East China Sea and a second nuclear power even closer, on the Korean Peninsula. The emphasis of In Defense of Japan, however, is on the industries that pushed military applications when they could not make money from commercial projects. Today, in addition to ballistic missile defense capabilities developed in cooperation with the United States, Japan is working on reusable launch vehicles (that is, space planes); satellites that detect missiles and help with navigation, communication, and targeting; warhead reentry technologies that can advance the use of missiles in warfare; unmanned aerial vehicles; and technologies for ""space situational awareness,"" which reveal a concern about possible future conflict in space. It is too soon to count Japan out in the arms race in Asia."
11,"Nucleus and Nation: Scientists, International Networks, and Power in India",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2011-01-01/nucleus-and-nation-scientists-international-networks-and-power,"Nucleus and Nation: Scientists, International Networks, and Power in India","Anderson explores the untold stories of the 30 or so key scientists behind the Indian nuclear program, from its roots in the formation of an Indian scientific community in the 1920s, through the exploration of peaceful uses of nuclear energy in the late 1940s, to the decision to explore designing a bomb after the first Chinese nuclear test in 1964, and then to the first Indian explosion in 1974. The fruit of nearly 50 years of research and interviewing, the detailed narrative brings the men to life with personal details and a rich understanding of the historical and institutional context. The key figures are physicists such as Homi Bhabha, a multi-talented member of the extended Tata family and first chair of India's Atomic Energy Commission, and his successor, Vikram Sarabhai. Feuding and politicking as scientists do, this elite built up institutes, recruited young scientists, imported equipment and uranium, maintained ties with a global network of peers, and gained the support of wealthy businesspeople and political leaders, especially Prime Ministers Jawaharlal Nehru and Indira Gandhi. Most of the expertise, equipment, and material needed to build a bomb circulated more or less normally in the scientific community. Taking the next step required only a political decision: once made, cosmopolitan men carried out a nationalist project."
12,"Changing Media, Changing China",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2011-01-01/changing-media-changing-china,"Changing Media, Changing China","The commercialization of media, the professionalization of journalism, and the rise of the Internet are usually seen as forces that challenge party control in China. But this collection of essays shows that they can also strengthen the regime. As media grow more diverse and professional, they provide a more credible channel for government propaganda. As they compete for audience attention by exposing selected scandals that are not placed off-limits by censors, they help the higher-level authorities rein in corrupt local officials. And by giving voice to citizens' concerns, they allow the government to respond before problems become acute. To be sure, these factors also raise the risk that fast-spreading news might provide a focal point for mass mobilization at a moment of crisis. But so far, the Internet police and Propaganda Department censors have managed to keep most citizens ignorant of topics that might inflame serious opposition. The Chinese and foreign contributors to this book provide a nuanced, clear analysis of the fluid relationship among the Communist Party, the media, and the public."
13,When a Billion Chinese Jump: How China Will Save Mankind -- or Destroy It,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2011-01-01/when-billion-chinese-jump-how-china-will-save-mankind-or-destroy,When a Billion Chinese Jump: How China Will Save Mankind -- or Destroy It,"As The Guardian's environmental correspondent in Asia, Watts has traveled all over China to report on the myriad ways in which development there is ruining the environment -- through the accumulation of rubbish, the extermination of wildlife, the damming and diversion of rivers, the electrocution of fish, the confiscation and poisoning of farmland, the acidification of rain, and the dumping of wastewater into rivers and lakes. A lot of the dross dumped in China is effluent from factories producing for Western markets or garbage sent back from the West. Well-meaning government regulation is too weak to counter the pent-up lust for wealth. China may be ahead of the West when it comes to renewable energy and ""green"" buildings, but these advances are still in their nonage. By portraying the yin of pollution along with the yang of economic dynamism, the book renders a broad-gauge picture of China today. The country contributes in many ways to global warming -- through deforestation, overgrazing, wasteful consumption, and, of course, emitting carbon in the manufacturing process. The subtitle may exaggerate -- China by itself will neither destroy mankind nor save it -- but the book brings home how the environmental impact of China's growth affects everyone."
14,Behind the Killing Fields: A Khmer Rouge Leader and One of His Victims,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2011-01-01/behind-killing-fields-khmer-rouge-leader-and-one-his-victims,Behind the Killing Fields: A Khmer Rouge Leader and One of His Victims,"This book recounts the never-before-told story of ""Brother Number Two,"" Nuon Chea, who, at age 84, awaits trial for the crimes he committed during the Cambodian auto-genocide of the late 1970s. It details the growth and ideology of the Khmer Rouge movement, the dynamics among its leaders, and its tortured relations with Vietnam. Having spent six years conducting about a thousand hours of interviews, the authors have produced a rare look inside the psyche of a mass killer. They find a faithful son and loyal husband, an idealist, ascetic, and moral purist who blames the Cambodian people for being too corrupted by imperialism and capitalism to implement the pure-minded plans of the Angka (""organization""). Nuon Chea insists that the two million who died were Vietnamese agents, exploiters, wreckers, enemies of the revolution, and hidden traitors -- as well as a few killed by honest mistakes in the course of trying to renovate Khmer society and others who died because local cadres incorrectly implemented the leaders' guidelines. None of it was his fault. This important story -- told with a restraint that makes it all the more effective -- confirms the banality of evil."
15,The ETIM: China's Islamic Militants and the Global Terrorist Threat; The Uyghurs: Strangers in Their Own Land.,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2011-01-01/etim-chinas-islamic-militants-and-global-terrorist-threat-uyghurs,The ETIM: China’s Islamic Militants and the Global Terrorist Threat; The Uyghurs: Strangers in Their Own Land.,"Among the many Uighur organizations that the Chinese government labels as terrorist is one that the U.S. government placed on its own terrorist blacklist after 9/11: the East Turkistan Islamic Movement (ETIM). Some analysts viewed that listing as a grant of U.S. support for Chinese repression in exchange for help in the war on terrorism. The counterterrorism analysts Reed and Raschke review the open-source evidence (much of it from China) that they believe shows ETIM to be a true terrorist force, with an ideology that is both separatist and fundamentalist. They track its changing names, logos, and leaders and locate it in the context of other Uighur militant groups. They make a strong case that although it is small and has not accomplished much, the organization practices terror."
16,The Berlin-Baghdad Express: The Ottoman Empire and Germany's Bid for World Power,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2011-01-01/berlin-baghdad-express-ottoman-empire-and-germanys-bid-world,The Berlin-Baghdad Express: The Ottoman Empire and Germany’s Bid for World Power,"This is the story of Germany's plans to bring the Ottomans into World War I and then to play the jihad card against the Allies, which held most of the Muslim world in colonial thrall. It is good, old-fashioned history as biography. Kaiser Wilhelm II, the mercurial archaeologist Max von Oppenheim, and ""the Three Pashas,"" Cemal, Enver, and Talat, loom large. But many others -- friends, foes, and would-be Muslim recruits to jihad -- are also well delineated. In telling the story of the Central Powers' less-than-successful recruitment of locals, from Libya to Arabia to Afghanistan, McMeekin demonstrates the fragility of this jihadist dream. And his accounts of the victory over the Allies at Gallipoli and the failure to complete the Berlin-Baghdad rail line nail down the greater importance of military skill and geopolitical givens in determining outcomes. A secondary theme is Germany's contradictory flirtation with Zionism, which McMeekin returns to in his epilogue, ""The Strange Death of German Zionism and the Nazi-Muslim Connection."""
17,The Israel-Palestine Conflict: Contested Histories,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2011-01-01/israel-palestine-conflict-contested-histories,The Israel-Palestine Conflict: Contested Histories,"For more than three decades, Caplan has been producing meticulous studies of different periods of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. In this book, he goes beyond the basic chronological narrative to analyze the self-images and images of the other that the Israelis and the Palestinians have brought to their long-standing confrontation. In such ""contested histories,"" each party sees itself as an innocent victim; Israel views itself as the product of a noble national movement, whereas the Palestinians think of it as an egregious example of colonialism. After attemping to define the conflict -- addressing ""loaded terminology,"" periodization,"" and ""core arguments"" -- Caplan recounts the confrontation from the rise of Zionism and the early stirrings of Arabism to today. He also discusses Israel's ""new historians"" and the understandably more muted historical revisionism from the Palestinian side -- and reflects on the need to transcend ""nationalist"" history. A whopping 28-page bibliography and a chronology complete what is surely one of the most accessible, coherent, and balanced accounts available of this very contested history."
18,A Privilege to Die: Inside Hezbollah's Legions and Their Endless War Against Israel,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2011-01-01/privilege-die-inside-hezbollahs-legions-and-their-endless-war,A Privilege to Die: Inside Hezbollah’s Legions and Their Endless War Against Israel,"In the summer of 2006, Israel launched a devastating incursion into Lebanon that badly mauled, but failed to knock out, Hezbollah. In the last days of 2008 and early 2009, Israel moved with equal fury against Hamas in Gaza, in a short war that Hezbollah opted to stay out of. Cambanis' intimate account of this recent history, enhanced by stories of a handful of Hezbollah's true believers and sympathizers, paints a gripping portrait of this radical religio-political movement. In an often discursive, largely first-person narrative, Cambanis presents an impressive organization, bearing the awesome title ""Party of God,"" that is virtually a state within the state of Lebanon. Hezbollah provides social services. Its leaders live modestly and level with their followers, thereby earning the group tactical flexibility. Hezbollah proudly acknowledges receiving support from Iran and Syria and would be weaker without it, but the group is too deeply rooted in Lebanon to be the tool of any outsider. Cambanis stresses equally Hezbollah's radical militancy, which makes a more accommodating arrangement within Lebanon or vis-à-vis Israel unlikely to emerge. Indeed, a depressing theme of A Privilege to Die is the way that less organized, less fervent, and more corrupt moderates have lost out to radicals since the 1970s."
19,America's Misadventures in the Middle East,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2011-01-01/americas-misadventures-middle-east,America’s Misadventures in the Middle East,"An award-winning career diplomat, Freeman was U.S. ambassador to Saudi Arabia at the time of the Gulf War. Retiring from the Foreign Service in 1994, he remained no less involved in international affairs, being active in the U.S. Institute of Peace and the Middle East Policy Council, among others. A seemingly ideal candidate for a return to government service, Freeman was asked to serve as chair of the National Intelligence Council in early 2009 but faced a campaign that forced him to withdraw his name. From the charges against him and those making them, it is clear that he was deemed too close to Saudi Arabia and too far from Israel. This collection of 23 short papers and speeches produced from the late 1990s to 2010 puts the lie to such charges and demonstrates instead a broad-ranging critique of recent U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East. Freeman's is a foreign policy of national interests, not friends or favorites. He is prudent about seeking monsters to destroy (or bringing the blessings of democracy) and believes that any military intervention must have in place an adequate postconflict policy. He argues that an acceptable settlement between Israel and its Arab neighbors is a priority and that Washington needs to work with Arab states.

This three-way confrontation is even more complicated. Any settlement or military action must involve other countries, including European states, Russia, China, and Arab states that fear Iran's expanding power but are reluctant to line up with Israel, which is seen as suffocating the Palestinians. In the midst of this ticking-bomb crisis, Allin and Simon have organized all these complexities and produced a readable, short book that fairly presents the positions of all involved, evokes the historical context, details the intertwining of domestic politics with the ongoing international crisis, and even takes on what might be dubbed ""the psychology of leadership"" in the final chapter, ""Obama's Words."" Not only is the book the best description available of ""the sixth crisis"" that Washington has faced in the Middle East since World War II; it also suggests a U.S. policy: given the likely failure to reach a negotiated settlement, a regional variant of the Cold War containment policy might be the best default position."
21,"Realism, Tolerance, and Liberalism in the Czech National Awakening: Legacies of the Bohemian Reformation",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2011-01-01/realism-tolerance-and-liberalism-czech-national-awakening,"Realism, Tolerance, and Liberalism in the Czech National Awakening: Legacies of the Bohemian Reformation","This book is a meticulous history; the footnotes are two-thirds the length of the text. In locating the wellsprings of modern national consciousness in the Czech Republic, and by extension its liberal political culture, David credits the ideas of the Bohemian Reformation in the fifteenth century, which were resuscitated and embraced during the Austro-Bohemian Catholic Enlightenment in the eighteenth century. More precisely, he traces the intellectual impulses inspiring the ""national awakening"" in the late eighteenth to early nineteenth century to the liberal, tolerant, and ""nonaristocratic"" thought characteristic of the Bohemian Catholic Church set up by the followers of the theologian Jan Hus in the sixteenth century. In a long-standing historical debate, David lines up against those who focus less on the lineage of ideas and more on linguistic-ethnic particularities and the sociology of identity associated with German Romanticism and idealism. But he is not only uncovering the roots of Czech political culture; he is also following an important stage in the development of analytic philosophy. Hence, the reader needs to be prepared to follow the fundamental philosophical quarrel that the early-nineteenth-century Czech scholar Bernhard Bolzano had with Immanuel Kant, Johann Gottlieb Fichte, Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph von Schelling, and, above all, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel."
22,Lonely Power,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2011-01-01/lonely-power,Lonely Power,"Long one of Russia's premier political analysts, Shevtsova has grown sharper and more charged as Russia has edged deeper into the Putin era. The country's self-seeking power elite has ""used the West in order to save an anti-Western system,"" and many in Russia and the West who should know better have either wittingly or unwittingly played along. She calls Russia's system ""bureaucratic capitalism"" spliced to ""imitation democracy,"" created by ""personalized power"" in the Yeltsin era and taken to its warped extreme in Vladimir Putin's. She applies her sensitive fingertip feel less to the country's deadened political pulse than to the system's interior dynamic, which she fears is unpredictable and imperiled by a regime that generates self-serving ambitions while blocking essential answers. Most of all, however, the book is a poignant appeal to the policymakers and analysts who have, as the Russian expression goes, ""looked through their fingers"" as Russia has passed from one lost opportunity to another. She identifies with those experts who have been most critical of her country, but when it comes to action, she aligns herself with those who want to engage Russia and give it constructive options, provided strict conditions are attached."

By her own confession, she was scarcely an impartial observer, having witnessed much of what served as the basis for the charges, but she provides more than a fair analysis of the proceedings' fumblings and ill-advised decisions. Hers is the front-row view of a first-rate court reporter, giving the reader a TiVo-like version, culled of dead space and repetition, that is still exhausting in its arduous pace and detail. Diligently, she watched and recorded as the court probed all three charges from Kosovo, back through the Croatian and Bosnian wars, tediously piling up the evidence as Milosevic bobbed and weaved. One comes away half heartened by the effort to answer unspeakable cruelty and suffering with justice but, in a way, more saddened by Milosevic's slippery success in persuading his partisans and many of his countrymen that they, not he, were on trial, the victims of great power bullies. And then there is the whimper with which it was all ended, by a heart attack that left him prosecuted but unjudged."

Count him among those who see the state -- at least a state capable of efficient regulation -- as crucial to the development of a proper market. Particularly in democratic and semidemocratic settings, he finds that the degree of partisan discord between the executive and legislative branches of government to be the decisive factor. Democratic states blessed with little partisanship make reforms more rapidly and consistently; as partisanship increases, reform suffers. Frye reaches this simple but original proposition through exceedingly painstaking argumentation -- first by establishing a statistical correlation between political polarization and its seeming effects, next by using a survey of business attitudes in 23 countries to establish causal links, and then by rounding out the analysis with a finely textured comparison of outcomes in Bulgaria, Poland, Russia, and Uzbekistan."

Over more than 35 years, since he first met Nikolai Bukharin's widow, Anna Larina, Cohen has developed a deep relationship with the widows and offspring of many of the gulag's celebrated and uncelebrated victims. By interviewing them, reading their memoirs, and digging through secret police archives, he collected material for a book he first planned to write in 1983. It tells the story of how survivors experienced liberation, what happened when they reentered society, and how, with varying degrees of success, they came to terms with what they had suffered. Misery was common, but, as Cohen stresses, its meaning and effects varied widely from individual to individual. This is not the thick, detailed book he originally intended to write, and it is all the better for that. It is also all the better for the graceful, pellucid writing."

Treisman argues that in crossing the rocky road of the last 25 years, Russia has emerged from the hermitic life of socialism to join in the normal process of international politics and Russians have joined the modern scramble of global travel, communications, and consumption. In a breezy and elegant account of these years, he tackles big questions: Why did Mikhail Gorbachev's reforms fail? Why did the Soviet Union collapse? What accounts for the dramatic twists and turns marking Russian politics from Gorbachev to Dmitry Medvedev? The common thread running through the answers to all these questions is economic trends -- particularly, economic decline. Economic changes, often affected by policy choices, eroded (or sometimes boosted) each regime's popular legitimacy and thus dictated the way each leader chose to play his hand. Other factors were also at work, including how the United States behaved toward Russia. All of this Treisman brings together by staying clear of abstractions and working with a rich assemblage of concrete, fascinating detail."

The common message of the Cuban, U.S., and Canadian contributors is that both the United States and Cuba bear some responsibility for the decades of tensions and that although neither society is prepared for sudden full normalization, there is much room for mutually advantageous cooperation. Indeed, despite the hostile atmosphere, the two contending states' bureaucracies are already working together on a range of specific matters. The brilliant essay by Temas editor Rafael Hernández, although rooted in a historically informed pessimism, nevertheless proposes enhanced bilateral interactions that, he asserts, need not compromise Cuba's national sovereignty (read: the hegemony of the Cuban Communist Party), a theme echoed by the former senior diplomat Carlos Alzugaray Treto in another essay. Similarly, the economist Jorge Mario Sánchez Egozcue outlines an enticing agenda for future exchanges in the biotechnology, telecommunications, and energy sectors. Hal Klepak, a Canadian, persuasively argues that Washington's and Havana's security establishments -- seeking regional stability -- are agents driving bilateral détente. Harvard's Jorge Domínguez ponders the potential implications for Cuba's internal evolution. (An English translation of the collection, titled Debating U.S.-Cuban Relations, is now available.)"

This meant that there were millions of dissatisfied and disorganized poor people -- a ready constituency for an antiestablishment soldier like him. Gates argues that the business class threw more fuel into this volatile mixture, contributing to its own demise in two ways. First, business had become closely associated with ineffective governments widely perceived as corrupt, so voters rejected traditional candidates. (Gates does not judge whether these media-generated perceptions were accurate.) Second, ""outlier"" business owners, opportunistically seeking future access to a likely winner, betrayed their class and funded Chávez's campaign. So it not just the rejection of free-market ""neoliberal"" policies that elevated Chávez to power; it was also popular perceptions of business corruption and internal divisions among the business elite."

(The list includes the Hall of Fame pitcher Juan Marichal, the slugger Sammy Sosa, and the rising star of the New York Yankees Robinson Cano.) The answer begins with sugar: the long off-season allowed plenty of time for sports, and the sugar mills sponsored baseball teams. The children could only afford baseballs made of rolled up socks, which have an uneven trajectory, a replacement that turned out to be excellent training for aspiring hitters. Then the Dominican Republic got its big break: the Cuban Revolution shut down the flow of Cuban players, driving baseball scouts to San Pedro de Macorís. Now, the industry tradition is deeply engrained: the Dominican Republic has a high-quality winter league, an organized array of baseball academies and stadiums, and leading baseball families (such as the Alous and the Canos). Today, Dominican players account for about one-quarter of all minor leaguers -- and that excludes New Yorkers of Dominican origin, such as Alex Rodriguez."

A dual Colombian-French national, she is feted in France as a courageous activist who took great risks in the pursuit of peace but provokes controversy in Colombia. Was her kidnapping the result of her government's purposeful security lapses or a consequence of her own reckless political grandstanding? In captivity, did Betancourt behave with undaunted dignity, as she asserts, or did she take advantage of her celebrity to gain privileged treatment, as other hostages have alleged? Surprisingly, in this memoir, her politics come off as somewhat superficial; her allegiances, unstable. Looking back on her six and a half years of torment, she makes a virtue of ambiguity: ""I have become a complex being. . . . I am torn between opposing emotions. . . . I can accept my inconsistencies without worrying about other people."" And her assertions, à la Nelson Mandela, that she has exorcised the urge for revenge and seeks only Christian love do not quite ring true. Nevertheless, the book succeeds as an intimate confessional memoir. It is a moving exploration of self-discipline and resilience on the part of captives and captors battling to survive, in body and soul, under the most extreme conditions."
31,The New Brazil,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2011-01-01/new-brazil,The New Brazil,"For the corporate executive facing his or her first long flight to São Paulo, here is the perfect briefing book. A seasoned student of Brazilian politics, Roett swiftly and expertly reviews the country's Portuguese past, twentieth-century strife, and more recent triumphs. Without ignoring Brazil's many remaining challenges, Roett views the glass as more than half full. He is confident that the continental giant of 190 million citizens is finally on the path to democratic prosperity, regional leadership, and global influence. Especially admirable are Roett's assessments of the successful presidencies of Fernando Henrique Cardoso and Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva; the four-page concluding chapter is a gem of tight historical interpretation. Roett is a fan of Brazilian foreign policy -- ""tough but pragmatic"" -- even as he criticizes Brazil's failed policies toward Honduras and Iran. But he probably underplays the anti-U.S. currents in the Brazilian Foreign Ministry and its tendency in international policy forums to prefer clever maneuvers to constructive contributions. In that immaturity, Brazil has company from China, India, and Russia, all emerging-market economies that must learn that with power comes responsibility."
32,Italy Today: The Sick Man of Europe,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2011-01-01/italy-today-sick-man-europe,Italy Today: The Sick Man of Europe,"The scandals, speeches, sex, and partisan scheming of Italian political life have always grabbed media attention. Yet the central question of Italian politics often goes unasked: How did the most successful country in postwar Europe become a basket case? In 1987, with much fanfare, Italy's per capita income overtook that of the United Kingdom; in 20 years, if current trends continue, it will be overtaken by Romania's. The interdisciplinary group of authors in this collection sets aside short-term factors and explores long-term structural reasons for Italia malata (ailing Italy). They offer new insights into well-known problems: the poor productivity of small firms, a lethargic legal system, weak universities, rampant corruption, the absence of meritocratic advancement, and the continued underdevelopment of the south. They also highlight problems known only to experts: little government support for families, the spread of organized crime outside of Naples and Sicily, low levels of social trust, and anti-immigrant sentiment."
33,1939: Countdown to War,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2011-01-01/1939-countdown-war,1939: Countdown to War,"Overy argues that ""nothing in history is inevitable"" -- not even the outbreak of World War II. This concise, clearheaded text seeks to prove the point by describing 11 days in 1939, from August 24, when the Nazi-Soviet Pact was signed, to September 3, when France and the United Kingdom declared war on Germany. With events and information moving faster than they could be processed and decision-makers suffering from exhaustion and stress, both sides acted with ""growing irrationality."" Hitler believed the assurances of Joachim von Ribbentrop, his foreign minister, that the French and British were bluffing, and so expected to prevail quickly against the Poles alone. French and British leaders sought to redeem their ""national honour"" by extending a guarantee to Poland and deterring Hitler, and so gave little thought to how that guarantee might have to be honored in practice. Overy's narrow focus willfully obscures the legacy of World War I, Hitler's unbounded ambitions, the failed strategy of appeasement, and other complex causes that perhaps made war inevitable. Still, it makes for provocative reading."

Others consider the EU's efforts -- and perhaps all such policies -- ineffective. This slim volume is the newest among many assessments of Europe's attempts to promote good governance, human rights, and democracy. Even if the book lacks rigor in establishing comparative standards and metrics, it is informed by scholarly literature and provides useful case studies of EU efforts in Iraq, Morocco, Ukraine, and elsewhere. The result is sobering. Local domestic political structures, geostrategic concerns, and energy policy tightly constrain European policymakers. They have to be pragmatic, accepting the inherently limited and secondary role of any international intervention. Europe tends to compromise, the book suggests, by focusing on improving governance at the expense of improving democracy."

His virtues are journalistic -- most notably, a brilliant eye for spotting a memorable detail in an exotic locale -- yet his vision is broader than most reporters or columnists. He knows his history and literature, and he combines reportage with passionate political commitment. To be sure, these 48 short essays published over the last decade indulge some journalistic vices. They were written in the moment, and some have thus been overtaken by events: there are ruminations over the proper response to weapons that Iraq did not have, criticisms of an ""Enlightenment fundamentalism"" that Garton Ash now admits is illusory, and confident predictions about the spread of Ukraine's Orange Revolution that never came true. Moreover, the essays are selective, focusing on flashy subjects that make for engaging interviews: heroic revolutionaries, sordid politicians, and exotic nationalists. Economic interests and electoral calculation, the bland bread and butter of modern politics, play little role. Still, one would like to think this is how history is lived, and the result is engaging. These vignettes are highly recommended for those who cannot wait for the proverbial owl of Minerva to spread its wings."
36,A Journey: My Political Life,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2011-01-01/journey-my-political-life,A Journey: My Political Life,"This book is nearly unique among modern political memoirs in that the author is said to have written it. The resulting prose is at best cloying and chatty, at worst cliché-ridden and convoluted. It recounts few political events that recent British memoirs have not already described. On Iraq it is evasive. Yet it is worth the read because it reveals, better than any book of its kind, how modern politics really works. To judge from Blair's frank and surprisingly cynical admissions, politicians are often ignorant, scared, and burdened by the past. Their environment is hostile, as illustrated by Blair's blunt asides on the small-mindedness of nongovernmental organizations, the hypocrisy of the Tory opposition, and the antagonistic incompetence of his buddy Gordon Brown. To achieve anything, leaders must corner electoral opponents with clever rhetoric that manipulates, even misleads, the public. In the end, many historically important matters are decided on little more than gut instinct and personal morality. No one can win at this game forever. This helps explain why a man who entered office with the reputation of being an instinctive politico, able to read the public mind with uncanny clarity, ended up -- for all his achievements -- a deeply disliked public figure."
37,Bloodlands: Europe Between Hitler and Stalin,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2011-01-01/bloodlands-europe-between-hitler-and-stalin,Bloodlands: Europe Between Hitler and Stalin,"This magisterial work chronicles in horrifying detail the mass murder of civilians by the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany from 1930 to 1945 in the ""bloodlands"" that lay between them: Poland, the Baltic republics, Belarus, and the Ukraine. Snyder's account is engaging, encyclopedic --  and controversial. Whereas many accord Hitler more blame than Stalin for such atrocities, Snyder treats the two as comparable. The numbers are similar. Hitler is customarily thought of as pioneering systematic extermination, but Stalin predates him by nearly a decade. German concentration camps are often referred to as a uniquely calculated, even ""industrial,"" form of butchery. Yet camps account for only a few million of the 14 million deliberate and systematic civilian deaths carried out by the two countries. Most victims of both governments were shot or driven into the wilds to die of starvation and disease. Many still insist that Stalin, believing that communist transformation would falter in the face of opposition from national minorities and rich kulaks, espoused more pragmatic views than his maniacal German counterpart. Yet Hitler was just as results-oriented, believing that military victory and fascist rule would elude Germany unless minorities were eliminated. For Snyder, what mattered most in the end was the commonality that both leaders sacrificed millions to grandiose totalitarian projects."
38,Bob Dylan in America,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2011-01-01/bob-dylan-america,Bob Dylan in America,"The distinguished Princeton historian Wilentz lives a double life: he is also a well-known commentator on the work of Bob Dylan and has been nominated for a Grammy for his liner notes on a Dylan album. In Bob Dylan in America, Wilentz brings his professional historical skills together with his appreciation for Dylan's work and for the rich American musical traditions from which it emerged. The result is a daring and unconventional book that does not always succeed -- but that always provokes and challenges. It is both a deep historical exploration of American music, ranging from the Delta blues to Aaron Copland, and a close commentary on various aspects of Dylan's career. The essays on American music history are extraordinary for their depth and detail, but they often seem too far afield from Dylan's work to belong in the book. The material on Dylan himself is deeply felt and often powerfully presented, but there are times when the fan appears to beat out the historian. Nevertheless, readers (or listeners, as the audio edition of the book includes snippets of music to illustrate some of the arguments) will find their interest in American music and Dylan stimulated and enriched. Popular music is one of the United States' most distinctive and influential forms of expression; if more historians worked like Wilentz to integrate America's music into the American story, the national narrative might become richer, more comprehensive, and perhaps even a bit wiser."

Bowman attempts to identify the ideological, political, and cultural forces that made the crisis of 1860 impossible to resolve peacefully. Taking the unconventional yet persuasive route of looking in depth at the lives and thoughts of a diverse group of influential people in the North and the South, Bowman demonstrates the degree to which each side had come to view the other as a conspiratorial, ruthless power that would not stop until it had subjugated its rival. The South viewed the Republicans' strategy of ""containing"" the ""peculiar institution"" as a plan for its ultimate extinction. Northerners, meanwhile, were leery of the South's desire to secure slavery's future by extending its reach into new territories in the tropics and ensuring the right of slaveholders to take their human property into federal territory. They saw this as a plan that would imperil the ability of Northern states to keep ""the Slave Power"" and even slavery itself at bay. Readers of At the Precipice are likely to come away feeling both that the Civil War was largely inevitable and that the instinct of U.S. politics to find compromise solutions is so strong that only a conflict as stark as the one between slavery and human freedom could overcome it."

Traister, one of the most powerful voices in a new generation of American feminist writers, explores the conflicted terrain on which many left-liberal American women found themselves first angered by what appeared to be unfair and even sexist treatment of Clinton at the hands of the press compared to the much softer coverage of her male rival -- and then feeling unaccustomed pangs of sympathy for Palin as much of the establishment press made her a figure of derision. Michelle Obama -- yet another dynamic professional woman, caught up in the contradictory expectations that surround a First Lady -- also, in Traister's view, had to navigate a treacherous path. Traister has a lot to say about what this series of events reveals about the state of American culture and American feminism, and her clear style and analytic bent make her both an entertaining and an enlightening guide. That Clinton, Palin, and Obama have all become more visible and more powerful since 2008 signifies something about the power and creativity of American women; Ginger Rogers is still dancing as deftly as Fred Astaire, and still doing it backward and in high heels."
41,Washington: A Life,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2011-01-01/washington-life,Washington: A Life,"Chernow, a distinguished historian, takes on the most important and most difficult subject in American biography: the life of the extraordinary Virginia colonial who, with his force of character, political skills, patriotic commitment, marmoreal propriety, and iron will, did more than any other person to establish the independence of the United States and make its republic work. From John Marshall onward, George Washington's biographers have usually failed. Washington was the nation's first performance artist: virtually his entire public life was a carefully constructed act, and writers have generally been unable to find the man behind the mask. Chernow's study of the young Washington, before the mask settled firmly into place, brings readers close to an insecure man fiercely determined to win honor and respect -- traces of whom can still be seen beneath the general and the president. The attention Chernow pays to Washington's life as a slave owner is revelatory: the irresolvable moral and economic dilemmas of the institution gave Washington little satisfaction and no rest, and by setting out both what he did and what he did not do about it, the account offers a uniquely insightful view of the contradictions and human reality underneath that impressive façade."
42,Obama's Wars,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2011-01-01/obamas-wars,Obama’s Wars,"Another president, another war, another fly-on-the-wall account by Woodward. A British politician once said that conducting foreign relations in a democracy is like playing bridge with a crowd of people behind you loudly discussing your hand and making suggestions about what cards to play. Public curiosity is certainly served by books of this kind; what is less certain is that the public interest benefits when the inner war councils of a serving U.S. president, complete with the hesitations and mental reservations that accompany any strategic discussion, are served out before an audience that necessarily includes U.S. enemies. Regardless, Woodward, as usual, has produced a riveting and at times revelatory read. Much attention has been paid to the book's insight into civil-military relations; some readers will be more interested in what can be learned about the quality of strategic thought in the White House and the Pentagon. The specter that haunts the war in Afghanistan is similar to the one that stalked Lyndon Johnson in Vietnam. Is this a war that an administration feels it cannot lose but does not know how to win? The answer to that cannot be determined from this book; one wishes the Taliban and Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence were blessed with Bob Woodwards of their own to give clues about how the current Afghan war will unfold."
43,The Dangers of a Nuclear Iran,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/persian-gulf/2011-01-01/dangers-nuclear-iran,The Dangers of a Nuclear Iran,"What to do about Iran's nuclear program is one of the most vexing foreign policy challenges confronting the Obama administration. This debate is increasingly characterized both by growing pessimism about whether the international community's diplomatic efforts and economic sanctions can prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons and by guarded optimism that the consequences a nuclear-armed Iran are manageable. Writing in these pages last spring, James Lindsay and Ray Takeyh, both of the Council on Foreign Relations, maintained that the United States could contain Iran even if it developed a nuclear arsenal by establishing clear ""redlines"" that Tehran would not be allowed to cross without risking some type of retaliation. For example, if Iran used its nuclear weapons, transferred them to a third party, invaded its neighbors, or increased its support for terrorist groups such as Hamas and Hezbollah, the United States would be compelled to respond, although the measures it chose to adopt would not be specified in advance. This argument reflects the public position of many senior U.S. and European officials, as well as a number of prominent academics and defense intellectuals."

She appears to have read everything, in many languages, about attempts to apply armed force effectively. The Evolution of Strategy will be the first port of call for those wanting to check up on the development of land strategy in the eighteenth century, maritime strategy in the nineteenth century, nuclear strategy in the twentieth century, or counterinsurgency strategy in the twenty-first century. She charts the continuing quest for reliable, even scientific, principles to guide the conduct of war and notes recurring themes, such as attempts to bridge the gap between war and ethics and the problems of translating battlefield victories into lasting peace. The book's great strength lies in the breadth of its author's reading. By paying attention not only to the broader political and cultural context but also to the writings of practitioners and some of the more secondary theorists, Heuser is able to show which ideas took root and why."

He identifies two main factors that determine a state's capacity to upgrade: the ability to afford the improvements and the organizational capital to adopt them. Both factors are normally important, but their relevance can vary. To become a nuclear power requires a considerable financial outlay but not much organizational change. Aircraft carrier warfare is both expensive and organizationally demanding. Adopting suicide bombing is a cheap tactic for a terrorist group but requires major organizational changes. Horowitz has successfully built on existing theories of organizational change and military innovation, but he might have made more of strategic considerations, which provide the impetus to spend both financial and organizational capital. His consideration of suicide bombing as a military innovation is imaginative, but his suggestion that the Catholic Provisional Irish Republican Army, which had to beware of Protestant paramilitaries, somehow missed a trick by not adopting this tactic betrays a gap in his research. The book also suffers from the curse of American political science in its occasional use of complex statistics to make unremarkable points."

Yet claims about casualties, in particular, are commonly used to demonstrate the inhumanity of belligerents or the urgent need for international action. Something expressed mathematically sounds more scientific than thoughts expressed in mere words. Andreas and Greenhill's book is not the first to warn of the misuse of statistics of conflict -- and given the deep-rooted nature of the tendency it addresses, it will not be the last -- but it does so comprehensively. The chapters forensically reconstruct the micropolitics of the production of seemingly trustworthy numbers about drug and human trafficking, atrocities, and casualties. When governments are being urged to act (as in Kosovo), the dark numbers get inflated; when they resist action (as in Darfur), they get deflated. The editors argue against the knee-jerk dismissal of all statistical claims, concluding instead that, as human constructs, these claims deserve careful scrutiny."

The U.S. engagements in Afghanistan and Iraq have lasted longer than each of the two world wars, and neither promises anything as satisfying as a clear-cut victory. The classic conclusion of a war, with the enemy surrendering in the wake of the unequivocal defeat of its forces, appears to have given way to messier outcomes, dependent on managing complex political processes. Except that, as Rose points out in his review of 100 years of American experience, successfully ending wars has always involved far more than military victory. Starting with World War I and ending with the Iraq war (and with clear implications for the war in Afghanistan), Rose shows how confused political leaders often are about exactly what they are trying to achieve in the coming peace. This can create the conditions for future wars; there had to be two against Germany and two against Iraq. He also shows how leaders tend to correct for the mistakes of the previous war; in the Gulf War, for example, the goal was to avoid another Vietnam. As Rose is the new editor of this magazine, it is comforting to note that he writes extremely well and knows how to hold a reader's interest while never losing sight of his serious purpose."

While acknowledging that extensive engagement with the world economy can produce higher material standards of living, he worries that the unintended side effects may create unwanted and even unnecessary social distress. He is also offended by the empirical casualness of the arguments sometimes advanced in support of liberalization. There are in fact many paths to development, he argues, and democratic societies should be free to exercise their collective preferences without having the institutional and policy preferences of outsiders thrust upon them. (Nondemocracies should not necessarily be given the same latitude.) Unfortunately, Rodrik does not apply the same scrutiny to how decisions are actually made in democracies -- through, for example, the manipulation of public opinion by elites -- that he does to the arguments concerning different paths to development."

They find that the balance of evidence strongly supports the claim that globalization has significantly raised standards of living for ordinary people around the world. But globalization, they emphasize, is not automatic; it needs to be nurtured continuously. Reversal is all too possible, especially given the widespread distress and political recrimination that have followed the recent global economic recession. Hufbauer and Suominen identify sources of emerging frictions, such as uncoordinated national climate-change measures, which complicate international trade, and state-owned enterprises and sovereign wealth funds, which complicate international investment. They also recommend policies to maintain globalization, some aimed specifically at the United States (introducing portable health insurance, extending unemployment benefits) and others that require international collaboration (agreeing on new trade rules, enacting greater financial regulation). The book contains many substantive and highly informative footnotes, too, which are worth reading apart from the text."

Paarlberg organizes his material around a long list of questions about food policies and practices, such as ""Are genetically engineered foods safe?"" ""Why did food prices rise in 2008?"" and ""How do farm subsidies shape international agricultural trade?"" His answers to these and many other questions are accessible and nuanced."

This richly detailed study of Indian emigration reveals how this movement of people affects the countries left behind, with a special focus on the diverse impacts of the Indian diaspora -- an estimated 20 million people -- on the politics, economics, social attitudes, foreign policy, and modernization of India. The rapid growth of remittances from Indian emigrants now exceeds official foreign assistance to the country. But Indian emigrants also send (through letters) or bring (through visits) new attitudes and new ideas based on their international exposure. Some provide overseas anchors for Indian exports or investments; others return to start businesses in India, drawing not only on their experience abroad but at least as much on the self-confidence they have gained through success. Another benefit: emigration by Indian elites, the author argues, helps stabilize India's democracy by giving the disgruntled the option of exit.

Not surprisingly, they find that central banks should assume more responsibility for the stability of the financial system, and they are inclined to favor inflation targeting as one method of their doing so. Discussing at length the merits and difficulties involved when central banks adopt a more supervisory role, the book contains noteworthy chapters on the special problems of central banking within Europe and in emerging-market countries, where financial systems are less well developed. Disappointingly, the authors devote little space to the challenges that large and potentially volatile international movements of capital pose for central banks."

By his count, there have been 209 such attempts since 1500. A majority of these had an ideological agenda. Between 1510 and 1700, Catholic and Protestant rulers in central and western Europe used force to aid coreligionists in other countries. Efforts to spread republican regimes, constitutional monarchies, and absolute monarchies were common in Europe and the Americas between 1770 and 1870, whereas most regime-promotion attempts in the twentieth century sought to defend or defeat communism, liberalism, or fascism. Another such struggle continues today in the Muslim world, with secularism arrayed against Islamism. Owen explains that in periods of intensified ideological contestation, rulers have generally believed that ""birds of a feather"" lend one another legitimacy and adopt more consonant foreign policies. He also argues that forcible regime promotion has been an opportunistic strategic weapon -- directed chiefly at unstable or defeated states -- rather than a principled end in itself. The practice, moreover, reinforces the perception that alien ideologies are monolithic and dangerous, creating vicious circles of polarization and interventionism. The historical narratives Owen employs to test this theory are nuanced, illuminating, and a joy to read."

About the legality of the U.S. invasion of Iraq, for example, he has advanced a decidedly skeptical view of international law. In this landmark book, Glennon lays out his alternative take. As he sees it, international law is simply what states make of it, and it matters only to the extent that states want it to. Whereas law within states is ultimately upheld through coercion, international law is based on consent: states must choose to abide by the strictures and obligations of international law, and they can just as easily withdraw their consent. In Glennon's hands, international law is shorn of its transcendent characteristics and becomes more like the run-of-the-mill rules and agreements that make up international relations. Indeed, when Glennon turns to the thorny question of law and the use of force, his discussion will look familiar to political scientists who study international institutions, legitimacy, power, and the rational choices of states. In the end, Glennon argues that since the United States is a party to more treaties than any other state, it has a special stake in the continuity and stability of international agreements -- a view the traditional international legal thinkers would surely affirm as well."
55,In War's Wake: International Conflict and the Fate of Liberal Democracy,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2011-01-01/wars-wake-international-conflict-and-fate-liberal-democracy,In War’s Wake: International Conflict and the Fate of Liberal Democracy,"The most profound effects of war are often felt far from the battlefield. In the mobilization for war and in its aftermath, states have expanded government powers, extended voting rights, reorganized political coalitions, and in many other ways transformed the very character of the state. This groundbreaking book brings together distinguished academics who explore the ways that the wars of the last two centuries have affected democracy. Scholars have long noted that major wars tend to cause states to expand political participation -- that the demands of raising mass armies during World War I and World War II, for example, resulted in new voting rights and social welfare provisions. Some authors here confirm this view, but the book as a whole tends to find more complex and uncertain linkages between war and democracy. One author shows that the conscription of mass citizen armies leads to more political participation within warring societies, whereas voluntary professional armies tend to have the opposite effect. Another finds that the growth of intrusive policing authority and government secrecy is tied more to domestic threats to political order than to international conflict. Several chapters focus on the bigger picture -- whether war has an impact on the very emergence of democracy. Edward Mansfield and Jack Snyder find no direct causal connection, but others see instances in which defeat bolstered democratic forces. Miguel Centeno raises perhaps the most ominous point: that the new type of war -- the ""war on terror"" -- has none of the democracy-enhancing effects of the mass-army sort. Instead, it reinforces the segregation of the military from the rest of society and undermines civil liberties."
56,"The New Dynamics of Multilateralism: Diplomacy, International Organizations, and Global Governance",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2011-01-01/new-dynamics-multilateralism-diplomacy-international,"The New Dynamics of Multilateralism: Diplomacy, International Organizations, and Global Governance","More than ever before, states conduct their business -- economic, political, security -- in or around multilateral forums. Institutions such as the United Nations, the World Trade Organization, and NATO are not only locations where states can negotiate but also repositories of widely shared rules and norms. Drawing on the views of scholars and practitioners, this study tracks the way multilateralism has moved beyond the state system to include nonstate actors and an expanding array of issues. Several of the chapters outline the deep shifts in thinking about anarchy and order, arguing that multilateralism is increasingly a value-laden norm about the virtues of rule-based global governance. Other chapters look at the actual operation of multilateral systems of rules, as states grapple with rogue regimes, nuclear proliferation, economic crises, and human rights abuses. The book's most interesting theme is that multilateralism -- as a form of organization -- has evolved from its origins as a set of principles for the conduct of diplomacy among sovereign states into a set of tools used to gain some control over a dangerously ungovernable world that exists beyond the state system."
57,A Leaner and Meaner Defense,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2010-01-01/leaner-and-meaner-defense,A Leaner and Meaner Defense,"The United States faces a watershed moment: it must decide whether to increase its already massive debt in order to continue being the world's sheriff or restrain its military missions and focus on economic recovery. Military power has dominated the United States' global engagement over the last decade, but it is now clear that the country overreached. Americans are questioning whether pursuing a defense strategy focused on counterinsurgency and nation building, supported by a defense budget that is growing continuously, makes sense at a time of severe economic and fiscal challenges. As the Obama administration enters the second half of its term and a new Congress assembles, the U.S. government must make difficult choices about which defense missions to undertake, exercise restraint in defense planning and budgeting, and bring tough management practices to the Pentagon."
58,Great Powers and Strategic Stability in the Twenty-first Century: Competing Visions of World Order,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/great-powers-and-strategic-stability-twenty-first-century-competing-visions-world-order,Great Powers and Strategic Stability in the Twenty-first Century: Competing Visions of World Order,"There is widespread agreement that the world is moving from unipolarity to a multipolar system, in which a handful of great powers will hold sway. What is debated is whether this return to multipolarity will be peaceful. This collection of essays does not give a clear answer, but the authors do provide a useful survey of the geopolitical landscape. Several of them explore the security threats and functional challenges that will be the focus of great-power politics in the years to come, including terrorism, nuclear proliferation, and energy security. Others look at the grand strategies of rising powers such as China, India, and Russia. The volume highlights the tension at the heart of twenty-first-century-style multipolarity. On the one hand, power and authority will be more decentralized and the inevitable struggles for influence between the United States and emerging non-Western powers will make cooperation more difficult. On the other hand, the challenges that the great powers will confront in the coming decades will be problems of interdependence, such as the environment and weapons proliferation, and so will require intensified cooperation."
59,Women and States: Norms and Hierarchies in International Society,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2011-01-01/women-and-states-norms-and-hierarchies-international-society,Women and States: Norms and Hierarchies in International Society,"Ever since the suffrage movement in the early twentieth century, governments around the world have enacted far-reaching reforms that have brought women into political life -- as voters, officials, and politicians. This fascinating book explores the logic of these historic changes, focusing on three advancements: women's suffrage, government bureaus mandated to address women's issues, and, more recently, gender quotas for national legislatures. In detailed empirical chapters, Towns untangles the complex ways in which states have adopted new practices. They have done so in ""waves"" of legislation among ""clusters"" of states. Women's suffrage, for example, first broke through in small western U.S. states and then spread to the rest of North America and western Europe; this was followed by movements in eastern Europe and Latin America, which then moved into Africa and Asia after states in those regions gained national independence. These patterns, Towns argues, reveal much about how states compare, rank, and compete with one another and how sudden shifts in notions of legitimacy can trigger transnational social movements."
60,Sudan's Secession Crisis,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/east-africa/2011-01-01/sudans-secession-crisis,Sudan’s Secession Crisis,"Under the Comprehensive Peace Agreement, the 2005 deal that ended the lengthy civil war between the north and the south of Sudan, voters in the south are supposed to vote on January 9, 2011, to decide whether their region should secede and form the world's newest country. The civil war, which lasted 22 years and during which an estimated 2.5 million southerners died, was fought over several issues: the central government's long-standing neglect of Sudan's periphery; the excessive concentration of jobs, wealth, and public services in the region known as the Arab triangle, along the northern part of the Nile River valley; the government's brutal attempts to impose Arab culture and Islam on the south, where Christianity and traditional religions prevail; its persistent refusal to grant the south any autonomy (except for a brief period in the 1970s); and its exploitation of the south's resources, particularly its oil, to fill government coffers. The Comprehensive Peace Agreement, which was signed by Omar al-Bashir, the president of Sudan, and John Garang, the leader of the southern rebellion, who was killed in a helicopter crash soon after the deal, was intended to correct some of these problems. It gave the south its own semiautonomous government and an independent standing army and required the upcoming referendum on secession. But now Khartoum's stalling tactics are threatening to delay the vote, with potentially disastrous consequences."
61,The Softer Side of War,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/review-essay/2011-01-01/softer-side-war,The Softer Side of War,"When U.S. forces invaded Iraq in 2003, the U.S. military was not particularly concerned about the impact of culture on its operations. U.S. leaders believed that the assault would play out as a high-tech conventional conflict and would be followed by a stabilization effort only slightly more difficult than the one U.S. troops had encountered in Kosovo a few years before. As the commander of the U.S. Army's First Brigade, First Armored Division, in Baghdad during the first crucial year after the fall of Saddam Hussein's regime, I quickly discovered not only that this assumption was incorrect but also that sectarian and ethnic identities, the role of tribes in Iraqi society, and the U.S. Army's own internal culture would weigh heavily on the course of the conflict, influence our approach to waging the war, and impact our interactions with our coalition allies."
62,Why the Rich Are Getting Richer,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/review-essay/2011-01-01/why-rich-are-getting-richer,Why the Rich Are Getting Richer,"The U.S. economy appears to be coming apart at the seams. Unemployment remains at nearly ten percent, the highest level in almost 30 years; foreclosures have forced millions of Americans out of their homes; and real incomes have fallen faster and further than at any time since the Great Depression. Many of those laid off fear that the jobs they have lost—the secure, often unionized, industrial jobs that provided wealth, security, and opportunity—will never return. They are probably right."
63,Enforcing the Peace,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/israel/2011-01-01/enforcing-peace,Enforcing the Peace,"In late August and September 2010, when direct negotiations seemed at last on the verge of replacing proximity talks between the Israelis and the Palestinians, speculation ran high in the Obama administration that face-to-face meetings between the two negotiating teams, hosted by U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, could at last produce an accord of enduring substance. Among several veterans of Middle East diplomacy, Martin Indyk, a former U.S. ambassador to Israel, was explicit in his optimism that the breakthrough moment was at hand, writing in The New York Times that ""the negotiating environment is better suited to peacemaking today than it has been at any point in the last decade."" In view of Israel's on-and-off settlement construction in the West Bank, however, and the frequent postponements of the Israeli-Palestinian dialogue, it is fair to ask if such optimism is really warranted."
64,Why Moscow Says No,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/russia-fsu/2011-01-01/why-moscow-says-no,Why Moscow Says No,"Russia's international behavior during the last decade has puzzled many U.S. observers. As seen from Washington, the greatest challenges of the moment—terrorism, nuclear proliferation, climate change—are global ones that threaten all states. The United States has been trying to organize multilateral responses. Yet the Kremlin has proved singularly unhelpful. For years, Russian negotiators have stalled efforts to compel Iran and North Korea to give up their nuclear weapons programs. Meanwhile, Moscow has applied economic and diplomatic pressure to keep nearby states from joining NATO or letting U.S. troops use their bases to fight the Taliban in Afghanistan. And in August 2008, Russia invaded Georgia and effectively detached two mountain enclaves from its territory."
65,"Small Arms, Big Problems",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/south-asia/2010-01-01/small-arms-big-problems,"Small Arms, Big Problems","In late 2001, in the early days of the war in Afghanistan, Western military planners worried about two types of dated weapons that were the legacies of the Soviet-Afghan war: shoulder-fired antiaircraft missiles and land mines. The United States had provided anti-Soviet forces with Stinger missiles in the 1980s, and the prospect that the Taliban or al Qaeda might have retained these weapons fueled fears that they would use them against Western military aircraft or, more menacingly, against commercial passenger jets worldwide. Land mines inspired a different but just as persistent unease: even after U.S. and Afghan forces chased the Taliban from Kabul, how could a country said to be littered with millions of mines develop at any kind of hopeful pace?"
66,The Good News About Gas,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/world/good-news-about-gas,The Good News About Gas,"Good news about energy is rare. Energy use and its cost are rising worldwide, most countries remain dependent on oil imports, and little progress has been made toward curbing climate change. So the world should take notice of the recent dramatic increase in estimates of unconventional sources of natural gas in North America and elsewhere, perhaps the greatest shift in energy-reserve estimates in the last half century. In the past few years, thanks to technological advances, vast amounts of natural gas -- particularly gas trapped in underground shale basins -- have become economically viable."
67,The Political Power of Social Media,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/political-power-social-media,The Political Power of Social Media,"On January 17, 2001, during the impeachment trial of Philippine President Joseph Estrada, loyalists in the Philippine Congress voted to set aside key evidence against him. Less than two hours after the decision was announced, thousands of Filipinos, angry that their corrupt president might be let off the hook, converged on Epifanio de los Santos Avenue, a major crossroads in Manila. The protest was arranged, in part, by forwarded text messages reading, ""Go 2 EDSA. Wear blk."" The crowd quickly swelled, and in the next few days, over a million people arrived, choking traffic in downtown Manila."
68,West Is Best?,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/review-essay/2010-12-16/west-best,West Is Best?,"In the 1940s, Joseph Needham, a British academic, began cataloging China's achievements in science and technology in an effort to understand why they were inferior to the West's. In his 40 years of study, he found that even though China may have seemed behind in such achievements at the moment, it had led the world in science a millennium before. He concluded that Confucianism and Taoism made a Chinese scientific revolution less likely because they allowed for only slow, incremental innovation, rather than overnight breakthroughs. Still, he recognized that this was only a partial explanation. Religions are not fixed, and if China's loss of scientific leadership stemmed from its religious attitudes, then what could account for the emergence and persistence of those attitudes?"
69,Less Than Zero,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/world/less-zero-0,Less Than Zero,"Once again, a global movement is afoot to free the world of nuclear weapons. Unlike the Easter marches of the 1950s and 1960s or the nuclear freeze movement of the 1980s, however, this time around, the policy elites themselves are leading the charge. The list of supporters of Global Zero, the new campaign's flagship organization, reads like a Who's Who of international strategy: from Zbigniew Brzezinski and Lawrence Eagleburger to Strobe Talbott and Philip Zelikow, from Carl Bildt and Hans-Dietrich Genscher to Igor Ivanov and David Owen."
70,Finish the Job,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/afghanistan/2010-12-13/finish-job,Finish the Job,"Pessimism abounds in Afghanistan. Violence, NATO casualties, corruption, drug production, and public disapproval in the United States are at record levels. Ahmed Rashid, a prominent Pakistani journalist and an expert on the region, declared the U.S. mission in Afghanistan a failure in his scathing 2008 book, Descent Into Chaos. Seth Jones, the leading U.S. scholar on the Taliban insurgency, has argued that the United States had an opening to make a difference in Afghanistan after 2001, but that it ""squandered this extraordinary opportunity."" U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates attempted to manage expectations when he testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee in January 2009. ""If we set ourselves the objective of creating some sort of Central Asian Valhalla over there, we will lose,"" he argued, ""because nobody in the world has that kind of time, patience, and money."" U.S. policymakers and the public increasingly doubt that the war can be won. These assessments are based on real and credible concerns about the rising insurgency, the drug trade, endemic corruption, and perennial government weakness."
71,Plan B in Afghanistan,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/afghanistan/2010-12-13/plan-b-afghanistan,Plan B in Afghanistan,"Current U.S. policy toward Afghanistan involves spending scores of billions of dollars and suffering several hundred allied deaths annually to prevent the Afghan Taliban from controlling the Afghan Pashtun homeland -- with little end in sight. Those who ask for more time for the existing strategy to succeed often fail to spell out what they think the odds are that it will work in the next few years, what amount of casualties and resources they think the attempt is worth, and why. That calculus suggests that it is time to shift to Plan B."
72,A Third Way to Palestine,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/israel/2010-12-16/third-way-palestine,A Third Way to Palestine,"This past September, as Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sat down in Washington to dine with U.S. President Barack Obama, a barely noticed event took place in Ramallah. With little fanfare, the 13th Palestinian Authority (PA) government, headed by Salam Fayyad, issued its one-year countdown to independence. This brief and understated document is likely to prove far more significant for the future of Palestine than the White House dinner and reflects nothing short of a revolutionary new approach to Palestinian statehood."

0,Inside African Politics,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2014-02-18/inside-african-politics,Inside African Politics,"Academics no longer need lament the absence of a good textbook on African politics for undergraduates. Englebert and Dunn have produced what will no doubt become the standard text for years to come: a sharply written, well-informed, and completely up-to-date book that should find a wide audience beyond the classroom, as well. Exceptional scholars in their own right, Englebert and Dunn introduce the reader to a wide variety of debates about the region, which they examine evenhandedly and with a minimum of jargon. The discussions of civil conflict and security issues are particularly good. The authors reveal how breakdowns of law and order are intimately connected to failed projects of national integration and state formation, and they place specific conflicts in their proper regional and international contexts."
1,Foreign Intervention in Africa: From the Cold War to the War on Terror,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2014-02-18/foreign-intervention-africa-cold-war-war-terror,Foreign Intervention in Africa: From the Cold War to the War on Terror,"Schmidt’s history of military intervention in the region during the last half century breaks no new empirical or theoretical ground, but it does provide a good introduction to the Africa policies of outside powers. She starts with the interventions that accompanied the decolonization of the parts of the continent long dominated by Belgium, France, and the United Kingdom (with a particularly good chapter on the Congo crisis in the early 1960s), then examines the conflicts surrounding the later decolonization of Portuguese-speaking Africa and the end of apartheid in South Africa. She finishes with a chapter on the African dimension of the U.S.-led “war on terror.” Schmidt assumes that economic interests motivated the outside powers that intervened in Africa during these conflicts, argues that such powers have almost invariably relied on the collusion and collaboration of local actors, and concludes that the interventions have usually had devastating effects on the continent. But she does not integrate her critique into a broader analysis of Africa’s international relations, barely mentioning foreign aid and humanitarian assistance and disregarding the effects of external support from the UN and regional peacekeeping forces."
2,Making Citizens in Africa; Food and Agriculture in Ethiopia,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2014-02-18/making-citizens-africa-food-and-agriculture-ethiopia,Making Citizens in Africa; Food and Agriculture in Ethiopia,"Two very different books, both fascinating, attest to the socioeconomic and political progress Ethiopia has made during the last two decades -- and to the enormous challenges still facing this country, whose more than 90 million people belong to 75 distinct ethnolinguistic groups and whose recent history includes civil war and several massive famines."
3,The Great African Land Grab? Agricultural Investments and the Global Food System,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2014-02-18/great-african-land-grab-agricultural-investments-and-global-food,The Great African Land Grab? Agricultural Investments and the Global Food System,"This measured book summarizes the extent of what is known about the recent evolution of the commercial market for land in sub-Saharan Africa -- which is to say, very little. Urbanization and population growth, combined with the global boom in commodity and food prices, have increased the value of land on the world’s least densely populated continent. The ambiguity of land titles and the weakness of property rights in the region provide openings for corrupt governments and avaricious local chiefs to wheel and deal with local and international investors. The losers in such arrangements are usually poor local populations who see their land expropriated without adequate compensation. Beyond those basic facts, the book offers mostly conjecture. Cotula concedes that no one really knows the total amount of land that has been sold since the sup­posed boom began during the last decade. Although a small number of massive land purchases by foreign governments and multinationals have made headlines and have led to an outraged narrative of “land grabbing,” Cotula cites one study suggesting that a majority of the confirmed sales have gone to local investors and involved parcels no larger than 210 acres."
4,Two New Websites on North Korea,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2014-02-18/two-new-websites-north-korea,Two New Websites on North Korea,"These websites offer unique insight into the North Korean enigma. Curated by the veteran diplomat and analyst Joel Wit and the North Korea scholar Jenny Town, 38 North posts vigorous short essays by accomplished North Korea watchers on the regime’s internal political struggles, foreign policies, and weapons activities and the daily lives of the North Korean people. Contributors ponder strains in Beijing’s relations with Pyongyang and offer suggestions for U.S. policy. The site also reviews books and debunks media myths. A special feature is a running analysis of commercial satellite imagery that often scoops the international news media with information about the status of North Korea’s nuclear weapons and missile programs."
5,Uncharted Strait: The Future of China-Taiwan Relations,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2014-02-18/uncharted-strait-future-china-taiwan-relations,Uncharted Strait: The Future of China-Taiwan Relations,"Bush’s masterful assessment of Chinese-Taiwanese relations predicts that “the momentum of cooperation on stabilization that began when [Taiwanese President] Ma [Ying-jeou] took office in 2008 will decelerate and most likely stall.” This was a prescient claim, as that is exactly what began to happen last summer, months after Bush’s book was published, after the Taiwanese legislature balked at passing a cross-strait agreement on liberalizing trade in services. Bush terms the subjects on which the two sides reached deals before 2013 “the low-hanging fruit.” Almost all the agreements concern economic affairs, with nothing substantive addressing politics. Progress has been further slowed by Ma’s recently plummeting approval ratings, which are currently languishing in the midteens. Bush could not have foreseen the dramatic decline in Ma’s popularity; indeed, no specialist has offered an adequate explanation for it. Ma’s ineffectiveness must surely increase Beijing’s worries. It might hasten the end of what Bush terms “the paradigm of mutual persuasion” and convince Chinese leaders to start exploiting their power advantage more aggressively. Bush’s book offers an exceptionally lucid and comprehensive analysis of what such a shift would likely mean for the region."
6,China Mission: A Personal History From the Last Imperial Dynasty to the People’s Republic,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2014-02-18/china-mission-personal-history-last-imperial-dynasty-peoples,China Mission: A Personal History From the Last Imperial Dynasty to the People’s Republic,"Three generations of Ronnings have been involved with China, beginning with Topping’s grandparents, Halvor and Hannah Ronning, who worked as missionaries in Hubei Province, in China’s deep interior, from 1891 to 1908. Their letters, diaries, and family photos allow Topping to tell their stories in moving detail. She shifts skillfully back and forth from the intimate canvas of family love stories and tragedies, to the complex dynamics of rural Chinese society, to the wide frame of Chinese politics during the Boxer Rebellion. Her account brings to life an unfamiliar society that was primitive and cruel and a missionary enterprise that was dangerous and almost insanely ambitious. Yet Halvor and Hannah saved many lives, taught many children, and won many converts. The story continues with China-related episodes from the life of one of Halvor and Hannah’s sons, Chester Ronning, a distinguished Canadian diplomat and Topping’s father, and from the lives of Topping herself and her husband, Seymour Topping, both journalists who have been involved with China on and off since 1946. All three generations fought against the mutual contempt felt by many Westerners and Chinese for each other’s cultures. This empathetic book continues that mission."
7,Asian Maritime Strategies: Navigating Troubled Waters,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2014-02-18/asian-maritime-strategies-navigating-troubled-waters,Asian Maritime Strategies: Navigating Troubled Waters,"Economic and technological changes are shrinking the Asian maritime commons. Cole reports that most of the littoral countries are building up their navies and coast guards. Lesser powers have acquired submarines and advanced tactical aircraft, although they seldom have clear strategies for using such technologies. Meanwhile, the region’s big powers must confront strategic dilemmas, including an increasing risk of accidents and clashes. The United States might not be able to maintain its dominance of Asian waters if it also insists on keeping up its deployments elsewhere. Japan’s navy takes second place to its coast guard when it comes to defending the country’s maritime interests because the constitution and public opinion limit the use of explicitly military forces. The Indian navy remains a budgetary stepchild of land and air forces that focus on Pakistan, even as India sees growing competition from China in its home ocean. For its part, China faces so many security challenges in its near seas that it might not be able to develop what it really wants: a “blue-water navy,” which would be able to project power in distant seas."
8,Chinese Industrial Espionage: Technology Acquisition and Military Modernization,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2014-02-18/chinese-industrial-espionage-technology-acquisition-and-military,Chinese Industrial Espionage: Technology Acquisition and Military Modernization,"This book rings alarm bells about technology theft on a scale that the authors say is unprecedented in history and that they believe has strategic implications. They claim that the U.S. government (for which two of the authors work) has underestimated the severity of the threat from China, prompting them to go public with a brief based entirely on open sources. Traditional espionage and hacking are only the most sensational techniques the Chinese authorities use to obtain proprietary information and technology. The others include employing a vast bureaucracy dedicated to collecting open-source material, demanding technology transfers from foreign investors in exchange for access to the Chinese market, participating in academic exchanges, and tapping ethnic Chinese professional and alumni associations in the West for intelligence. Innocent-sounding rhetoric about development and scholarship surrounds many of these activities, and many of the collection methods are legal. But the authors show that these intelligence and espionage activities constitute a strategic initiative guided from high levels of the Chinese government. They push back against what they anticipate will be charges of alarmism (and even racism) and argue that, so far, U.S. counterintelligence operations have been outmanned and outclassed."
9,Taming Tibet: Landscape Transformation and the Gift of Chinese Development,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2014-02-18/taming-tibet-landscape-transformation-and-gift-chinese,Taming Tibet: Landscape Transformation and the Gift of Chinese Development,"China’s attempt to consolidate its control over Tibet through modernization has gone tragically awry. After pouring money into programs for a “new socialist countryside,” “civilized cities,” and “comfortable housing” and even a “gratitude education” campaign, Beijing faces resentment. Yeh digs beneath accurate but incomplete conventional narratives of ethnic prejudice and religious repression to show how development efforts in the region have affected relations between Tibetans and the ethnic Han who make up the majority of China’s population. Entrepreneurial Han migrants to Tibet rent land and living space from residents and use government aid to start businesses, pushing local people to the economic margins. In response to Tibetan disaffection, the authorities have increased surveillance, making Tibetans feel “already guilty” just for looking and acting Tibetan. Drawing on anthropological theory, Yeh argues that development imposed from outside is “both present and poison.”"
10,Civil Society in Syria and Iran: Activism in Authoritarian Contexts,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2014-02-18/civil-society-syria-and-iran-activism-authoritarian-contexts,Civil Society in Syria and Iran: Activism in Authoritarian Contexts,"This collection calls into question, not always convincingly, a body of scholarship dubbed “transitology,” which emphasizes the positive role played by civil society during the transitions to democracy in eastern Europe and Latin America. Contributors to this volume counter that in Iran and Syria, civil-society organizations are tools in “authoritarian upgrading”; rather than catalyzing transitions to democratic rule, they aid repression. For instance, Bassam Haddad points out that as Syria pursued neoliberal reforms in the early years of the last decade, the state fostered Islamic nongovernmental organizations to fulfill certain welfare functions. But the collection presents inconsistent evidence. For example, Salam Kawakibi and Paola Rivetti suggest that “government organized nongovernmental organizations” might in fact evolve toward autonomy and opposition to the state on specific issues. And Peyman Jafari shows that over time the state-sponsored Iran Chamber of Commerce, Industries, Mines, and Agriculture has become hostile to the quasi-state sector. But none of the authors grapples with the basic underlying question: Can authoritarian regimes evolve toward political liberalization, or is rupture (violent or otherwise) the only way to break their grip?"

12,Shifting Sands: The United States in the Middle East,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2014-02-18/shifting-sands-united-states-middle-east,Shifting Sands: The United States in the Middle East,"Migdal’s intriguing analysis rests on a somewhat revisionist take of the main phases of U.S. Middle East policy, which forces readers to reconsider some conventional wisdom. Migdal asserts that the U.S. strategic alliance with Israel began not during the Six-Day War, in 1967, but rather in 1970, when U.S. support for Israel’s military buildup along its border with Jordan helped maintain stability during the regional conflict that grew out of the Black September revolt against the Jordanian monarchy. He also believes that the U.S.-Israeli strategic alliance actually ended with the 1990–91 Gulf War, when the United States forbade Israel from playing a role in responding to Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait and told the Israelis to sit quietly even as Saddam Hussein rained missiles down on Israel. U.S. Presidents Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush, and Bill Clinton all missed the significance of the decline of Arab nationalism and the simultaneous rise of political Islam and non-Arab actors -- namely, Iran and Turkey -- in the Arab world. During the Clinton years and until the September 11 attacks, Washington’s Middle East strategy was “rudderless.” President George W. Bush, by contrast, had a rudder -- but steered the ship in the wrong direction. Each of Migdal’s assertions is plausible and sometimes surprising, but it is possible to employ his evidence to arrive at very different conclusions."
13,After the Sheikhs: The Coming Collapse of the Gulf Monarchies,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2014-02-18/after-sheikhs-coming-collapse-gulf-monarchies,After the Sheikhs: The Coming Collapse of the Gulf Monarchies,"Predicting business as usual is always the safest bet. Davidson follows a riskier path, predicting that the monarchies and emirates of the Arabian Peninsula will collapse within the next five years. As causes, he cites declining fossil fuel reserves, fiscally unsustainable social pacts, restive Shiite populations, alienated youth, and the impact of the Arab uprisings. But the evidence he presents is not convincing. Much depends on the nexus of declining fossil fuel revenues and outlays on social welfare. But Davidson shares no systematic data on either part of that equation. And so far, the Arab uprisings have served to enhance, rather than undermine, the legitimacy of the Gulf monarchies. That said, the Sunni monarchy of Bahrain emerges as the one government whose grip on power seems most precarious, owing to the resistance of the country’s oppressed Shiite majority. But Bahrain’s ruling family has successfully wed itself to U.S. national security policy; the U.S. Navy’s Fifth Fleet is based in Bahrain. If Davidson’s predictions do materialize, the United States will be in an awkward position."
14,The Limits of Partnership: U.S.-Russian Relations in the Twenty-first Century,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2014-02-18/limits-partnership-us-russian-relations-twenty-first-century,The Limits of Partnership: U.S.-Russian Relations in the Twenty-first Century,"Until now, there have been no broad-based studies of the vexed contemporary U.S.-Russian relationship in English -- or, for that matter, in Russian. This volume fills that void admirably. It moves rapidly and succinctly over four U.S. presidential administrations, from that of George H. W. Bush to that of Barack Obama, attempting to understand why the “resets” with Russia undertaken by all four began with high expectations but ended each time with disappointment. Stent’s analysis proceeds chronologically, lingering longest over the issues that most roiled the relationship, such as the Iraq war, the 2008 Georgian-Russian war, missile defense, and, more recently, the civil war in Syria. The heart of the problem, Stent argues, is the asymmetry in the two countries’ economic power and military strength and the distance between their views of international realities. The relationship is also stymied by the inability of both sides to shake the legacy of the Cold War. Notwithstanding the genuinely important reasons Moscow and Washington have to cooperate, Stent contends that the relationship will remain a limited and troubled partnership as long as these obstacles are left in place."
15,The Myth of the Strong Leader: Political Leadership in the Modern Age,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2014-02-18/myth-strong-leader-political-leadership-modern-age,The Myth of the Strong Leader: Political Leadership in the Modern Age,"Brown warns of the dangers of leaders who, whether in a democracy or a tyranny, seek to dominate policy and all those around them. The reality or the delusion of unchallenged power often leads to faulty policy and misfortune for those governed. Better, Brown insists, that a leader possess “a questioning mind, willingness to seek disparate views,” flexibility, and courage, among other virtues. The argument is straightforward, but too rich and multidimensional to fit easily into conventional theory. Drawing on a long academic career spent studying leaders, principally in authoritarian communist regimes but sometimes in democracies as well, he explores a multitude of factors that influence leadership, including political culture, the institutions of leadership, forms of government, and the “psychological dimension.” He also presents three special categories of leaders: the “redefining” leader (who manages to effect “radical policy change”), the rarer “transformational” leader (who alters the domestic or international order itself), and the “revolutionary” leader (who, when in power, often becomes a distorted, high-cost version of the transformational leader). Brown concludes by judging success and failure among specific leaders in democratic, “hybrid,” and authoritarian systems.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."
16,The Crooked Mirror: A Memoir of Polish-Jewish Reconciliation,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2014-02-18/crooked-mirror-memoir-polish-jewish-reconciliation,The Crooked Mirror: A Memoir of Polish-Jewish Reconciliation,"Sometimes, meaning emerges from analysis; other times, from searing, soul-shaking experience. Steinman is a secular, second-generation American Jew whose ancestors immigrated to the United States from Poland. Like many others who share her heritage, she grew up alternately dismissing and despising Poles and Poland for their assumed indifference to or, worse, complicity in the Holocaust. But beginning with a visit to Auschwitz in 2000, she undertook a series of pilgrimages to Poland that ultimately brought her to Radomsko, her family’s ancestral hometown. There, she walked through the cemetery where some of her relatives, bullets to the backs of their heads, had fallen into trenches they had been forced to dig; and viewed the railway station from which other family members had departed for the concentration camp in Treblinka. Steinman describes these visits as feeling like a “brick to the stomach,” and the reader can feel it, too. No broad-based reconciliation takes place during her time in Poland, because she knows too well the role of anti-Semitism in the country’s past and witnesses its lingering hold. But she achieves something close to peace with those struggling intensely to understand and rectify Poland’s Jewish past."

Markowitz, using the cases of Uzbekistan and Tajikistan, stresses the importance of “immobile capital” -- for example, cash crops such as cotton or coffee, which require the sanction and facilitation of officials high up in the food chain. When local authorities, security services, and senior officials collude to profit from the sale of these goods, the state, although warped and weakened, hangs together. When such resources are scarce and local elites cannot find any willing patrons ready to make deals, those elites compete among themselves, suborn the security forces in their regions, and turn their backs on central authority. Such, Markowitz maintains, is what happened in the Tajik civil war of the 1990s. He concludes by applying his theory to six other cases, in Eurasia, the Middle East, and Africa.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

Merridale, however, does more than write an architectural history. She also embeds each phase of the citadel’s transformation, from its origins in the twelfth century to today’s era of Vladimir Putin, in the drama surrounding each of its autocratic overlords -- the machinations swirling within the toxic circle of aristocrats, court servants, and church officials who made up life within the Kremlin. The result is a full-bodied history of the often macabre reigns of the tsars who made the Kremlin the seat and symbol of their power, until Peter the Great substituted his creation, St. Petersburg. Merridale then explores what happened to the Kremlin during the long interlude before Vladimir Lenin moved everything back to Moscow in 1918. The book is not a broad history of Russia but makes a large chunk of that story enjoyable and accessible.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

Starr focuses on the genius polymaths who dominated the era, stressing their diverse origins, which were related to Persian and Turkic culture as much as to Arabic culture. In the process, he highlights the importance of those Central Asian roots, which have long been glossed over by historians. The book offers a lucid exploration of the era’s intricate philosophical and theological debates and a succinct depiction of its poetry and art, enhanced by many illustrations.

Walker’s Christian Democratic Party will represent an integral part of Bachelet’s governing coalition. His book provides a powerful exegesis of Chile’s remarkable successes, emphasizing the importance of learning from painful mistakes and of responsible leadership. Walker faults the failure of scholars of Latin American affairs to predict or even explain the region’s favorable outcomes. He rejects deterministic theories, many pessimistic, which had condemned Latin America to authoritarian politics and economic distress. Deploring irresponsible populism such as the type practiced by the late former president of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, Walker highlights the more positive, dominant wave of democratic legitimacy. For Walker (and Bachelet), the challenges ahead are to make democratic institutions more effective for the average citizen and, by raising taxes and social spending, to build a more communitarian economy capable of providing enhanced, universal benefits.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

Thus, it appeared that the Roman Catholic Church, and not other, more contemporary social institutions, remained the most influential transnational moral force in Nicaragua, embraced even by the populist Sandinista president, Daniel Ortega. Howe also examines the role of foreign scholar-activists and nongovernmental organizations that depend on international funding. Their agendas have evolved radically over time, shifting from a focus on Marxist notions of social revolution in the 1960s and 1970s to the advocacy of individual rights and civil-society activism today. Of particular interest is Howe’s reporting on three lesbian discussion groups, one hosted by a European-backed nongovernmental organization, another facilitated by local grass-roots activists, and a third convened in a rural setting. Throughout, Howe keenly observes “intimate pedagogies”: small face-to-face meetings that address deeply personal aspects of people’s lives.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."
22,Quesadillas,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2014-02-18/quesadillas,Quesadillas,"Narrated by a clever teenage boy, Quesadillas is a satirical, tragicomic, bottom-up portrait of Mexico in the 1980s, in the waning years of the Institutional Revolutionary Party’s dominance. In its treatment of youthful rebellion and alienation, the novel recalls J. D. Salinger’s The Catcher in the Rye. But Villalobos places his unhappy teenage protagonist in a specific Latin American political setting that defines the character’s social milieu and his family’s dynamics. The boy’s father, a high school civics teacher -- poor, but not dirt poor -- sits in front of his television and screams curses at fraudulent politicians and other phonies, while his mother bakes quesadillas whose quality fluctuates with the rate of inflation. The family loses their home as the result of a real estate scheme hatched by local elites. But the family itself is also appallingly dysfunctional: there are too many mouths to feed, there is constant bullying and deceit, the father’s stubbornness and pride blind his decision-making, and the mother is an emotional basket case. Redemption comes only through fantasies allowed by the novel’s magical realism."

This scholarly volume highlights the potential for good governance at an intermediate tier between the federal and the municipal levels: large metropolitan regions, which are well suited, the book’s contributors assert, to address pressing collective-action problems, such as natural disasters, inefficient infrastructure, and the unequal provision of social services. But the six country studies (on Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Mexico, the United States, and Venezuela) uncover few reasons for hope. Sustained experiments with metropolitan governance are surprisingly few in number, and they often fail to meet the contributors’ expectations. Several powerful forces appear to stand in the way: popular preferences for the national government or for very local politics, a lack of incentives to pioneer new institutions, inadequate metropolitan-level tax bases, and widespread reluctance to redistribute resources from wealthier to poorer areas. Apparently, the contributors’ preferences, particularly for the purposeful redistribution of wealth, are not widely shared in any of the countries in question.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

This narrative is interspersed with compelling interviews with, among others, the city’s besieged and courageous mayor, a sympathetic mistress of a successful drug trafficker, and a human rights activist. Between 2008 and 2010, the citizens of Juárez suffered through several intertwined struggles: turf battles between the Juárez and the Sinaloa cartels, between various levels of Mexican law enforcement, and between the cartels and the central Mexican state. In this Byzantine world, even the president of the country was accused of acting on behalf of one of the cartels. But Ainslie strongly believes that then President Felipe Calderón had no choice but to take on the increasingly powerful drug-trafficking organizations. Initially, the frightened citizens of Juárez welcomed the intervention of the army and the federal police. But as the violence mounted, the voters elected an old-guard mayor with a reputation for collusion with the drug gangs, anticipating that he could negotiate a truce. The violence in Juárez has since abated, but the causes of this are the subject of heated debate.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

The result was a series of paradoxes. The most successful Socialist leader of postwar France never fully renounced his lifelong links to Vichy collaborators, allied his party with the Communist Party only in order to destroy it, and ended up in a ruling coalition with right-wing parties. He socialized a third of the French economy, then turned around and privatized an even larger portion of it. He once came close to ruining his political career when he was double-crossed by someone he had hired to fake an assassination attempt on him. His personal life was just as tangled: he kept two families, one with his wife and the other with a mistress, while amicably sharing quarters with his wife’s lover. Short has interviewed more insiders than anyone else. The resulting book lacks precision on Mitterrand’s inner thoughts and on the policy challenges he faced, but it is the best account of the extraordinary machinations of this fascinating, ambiguous politician."

Engberg’s analysis challenges the conventional wisdom about European defense policy. To explain why Europe is not more active militarily, many observers point to interstate disagreement, a lack of adequate defense materiel, and the absence of centralized EU institutions. This book explodes those myths. In fact, the major European states rarely disagree, let alone block one another, and the greatest constraint on their action stems from sensible and prudent caution, often due to local conditions in the places where they seek to intervene. Moreover, European shortages of military materiel arise mostly because European forces are already active in so many places -- including Afghanistan, Lebanon, Libya, and numerous African countries. Finally, although EU defense cooperation could be improved, it is remarkably well suited to its major role of backstopping the UN, NATO, and ad hoc “coalitions of the willing.”Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."
27,Countrymen,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2014-02-18/countrymen,Countrymen,"This understated yet engaging book provides the best modern account of why, alone among all Nazi-occupied peoples, the Danes mobilized effective organized resistance to the Holocaust. They punished anti-Semites, evacuated most Danish Jews to nearby neutral Sweden, and interceded on behalf of the few unlucky enough to be deported to the concentration camp in Theresienstadt, in what was then Czechoslovakia. As a result, 99 percent of Danish Jews survived. These events have been subject to mythmaking over the decades, so Lidegaard’s nuanced and sober account is most welcome. A critical factor in the Danish campaign was the social solidarity of the Danes, who reacted almost unanimously against the persecution of minorities. Danish leaders also organized the evacuation pragmatically, offering direct payments to fishermen who ferried Jews across the straits to Sweden. One surprise is the essential role played by the ambivalence of some local Nazis, who -- perhaps aware that the war was not going well for their side -- quietly looked the other way and, in a few cases, even leaked vital information to the resistance. This intelligent and uplifting tale reminds readers that a tight sense of community and identity can be a force for progressive tolerance in the modern world."
28,Turbulent and Mighty Continent: What Future for Europe?,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2014-02-18/turbulent-and-mighty-continent-what-future-europe,Turbulent and Mighty Continent: What Future for Europe?,"In this book, Giddens -- an eminent British sociologist, a Labour Party member of the House of Lords, and the man often credited with coining the phrase “the third way” -- seeks to renew the commitment of the British left to social democratic ideals and to European cooperation. His argument rests on solid premises: the EU helps nations manage and master interdependence; EU reforms should be federal, balancing Brussels’ power with national and local governments; and Europe is mightier (for good or bad) than most observers believe, so resolving its current malaise should be a concern even to the British. Yet Giddens’ scheme for “a federal Europe, with the eurozone as its driving force” recycles tired slogans of the Brussels technocracy. He produces a familiar wish list that includes such things as a pan-European social welfare state that assures generational equity, standardized tax policies, new trade agreements, the admission of Turkey and other worthy countries to the union, and (in a surprisingly cursory conclusion) a deepening of the eurozone, largely at the expense of Germany. This vision looks good in theory but shows surprisingly little appreciation for the devilish details of how real-world politics work or for the tough tradeoffs imposed by today’s political and economic climate.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."
29,The American Senate: An Insider’s History,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/american-senate-insiders-history,The American Senate: An Insider’s History,"This is a rich repository of information about the quirkiest branch of the U.S. government. The Founding Fathers believed that the House of Representatives would emerge as the more powerful of the two legislative chambers; instead, from early times, the Senate has overshadowed its larger partner. In the Senate’s so-called golden age (roughly 1820 to 1854), debates among such giants as Daniel Webster, John Calhoun, and Henry Clay over slavery and the nature of the federal union transfixed the country, and the Senate became the chamber that addressed the most consequential questions of the day. In the twentieth century, the Senate maintained its supremacy over the House even as Congress as a whole lost ground to the presidency and the Supreme Court. For some, the Senate’s overrepresentation of small states makes it suspect, and bitter fights over its arcane rules continue to draw criticism. Nevertheless, the Senate remains one of the founders’ most successful creations, and The American Senate will help readers understand why."
30,Conspiracy Theories and Other Dangerous Ideas,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2014-02-18/conspiracy-theories-and-other-dangerous-ideas,Conspiracy Theories and Other Dangerous Ideas,"This book brings together a collection of what Sunstein, a Harvard Law School professor and former Obama administration official, calls his most controversial academic essays. The intellectual thread that runs throughout the essays, and the likely source of the controversy that surrounds Sunstein’s work, is a kind of moral monism at the core of his thought. Unlike liberals of earlier generations -- say, Isaiah Berlin -- who believed that people prefer many different things and will never agree on what the good life is, Sunstein is committed to an almost Rousseauian idea of the general will. It is the job of intellectuals to discover the “right” answers to policy questions, to persuade the unenlightened to see things the correct way, and to develop laws and institutions to realize the general good. Reflecting an attitude that defines the Obama administration, Sunstein values liberty for heuristic purposes; he believes that free inquiry and debate help elucidate the correct solution to social issues. He does not have much sympathy for the belief that the diversity of human preferences makes liberty and pluralism ends in themselves rather than means to forging a consensus."

Levin argues that for all their differences, Burke and Paine shared an overarching liberal worldview -- and so do their ideological heirs, whether or not they realize it. Today’s Tea Party conservatives, Levin argues, have much more in common with Paine’s radicalism than with Burke’s conservatism. But Levin also notes that Paine moved away from his libertarian, small-government views early in his career and urged a greater government role in protecting the poor and the aged from the economic vicissitudes of the Industrial Revolution. Today, the argument between the radical, humanist Paine and the cautious, tradition-minded Burke is played out on both the left and the right sides of the American political divide. The Great Debate won’t settle any of the political disputes roiling U.S. politics today, but those who read it carefully will find it easier to understand their opponents -- and perhaps even to find some common ground."

Bush era in U.S. politics was one of drama, conflict, and polarization. In producing the first comprehensive narrative history of what will surely remain one of the most controversial presidential administrations in U.S. history, Baker has done yeoman’s service. All subsequent writers dealing with the subject will find his book indispensable. Focusing on the difficult and changing relationship between Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney, Baker sifts through the conflicting stories and memories of the main players to show how and why the administration responded to its challenges as it did. Like many observers, Baker sees a shift between the first and the second terms of the administration, as Cheney’s influence declined and Bush’s thinking gradually changed, especially on foreign policy. Many observers wondered which man was really in charge; Baker’s conclusion, which will almost certainly stand the test of time, is that Bush is his own man and was responsible for the decisions made in his name.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."
33,Duty: Memoirs of a Secretary at War,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2014-02-18/duty-memoirs-secretary-war,Duty: Memoirs of a Secretary at War,"In this engaging and candid memoir of his time as U.S. secretary of defense in both the Bush and the Obama administrations, Gates offers some trenchant criticisms of the way executive and legislative policymakers have addressed the problems of the last eight years. Gates directs most of his ire at Congress and the Pentagon bureaucracy. In Gates’ view, both institutions failed to respond to the wars of the last decade with sufficient energy and vision. Congress continued to focus on pork-barrel spending and narrow political interests at the expense of intelligent defense planning. The Pentagon bureaucracy resisted pressure to shift to a wartime footing, dragging its feet on urgent military needs and neglecting to adequately care for wounded warriors. Gates found himself increasingly frustrated and came to see his main task as advocating for the frontline troops against the bureaucratic and political status quo. Young people who want to understand and live up to the highest ideals of American statesmanship would do well to read this book carefully; Gates has much to teach about the practical idealism that represents the best kind of American leadership."

In his thorough exploration of why and how foreign fighters get involved in wars far away from their homes, Malet focuses on the importance of transnational identity and the need to support fellow members of a community under threat. His case studies include the Texas War of Independence (an inspired choice), the Spanish Civil War, the Israeli War of Independence, and Afghanistan from 1978 to 1992, with some concluding observations on Islamist participation in various recent conflicts in the Middle East. Three important themes emerge from this account. The first is the essential role played by organizations that recruit, train, and dispatch volunteers. The second is the importance of how conflicts are framed in determining whether volunteers can accept another’s fight as their own. And the third is the tendency of indigenous and foreign fighters to eventually fall out with each other.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

But her knowledge of nuclear matters is superficial, and she says very little about the weapons, other than to draw attention to their awfulness and to the fragile, illegitimate, and dangerous structures that govern their possession and potential use. The book is mainly a treatise on the social contract between individuals and governments. It includes some interesting ruminations on the sources of consent and on human behavior in emergencies. Even on such abstract matters, Scarry is reliably readable. But having underlined the absurdity of the nuclear condition, in which fallible human beings can inflict terrible destruction in a matter of minutes, she offers only a feeble remedy. Her proposal is to reassert those provisions of the U.S. Constitution that distribute responsibility for war-making among the population rather than concentrating it solely in the hands of the executive. She does not explain, however, how ordinary people in the United States and other nuclear countries might come to share her views, much less act on them.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."
36,The Value of Violence,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2014-02-18/value-violence,The Value of Violence,"Ginsberg’s book is a direct challenge to the optimism of the celebrated cognitive neuroscientist Steven Pinker, whose 2011 book, The Better Angels of Our Nature, argued that violence is playing a diminishing role in human affairs. Ginsberg counters that violence is essential both to transformational change and to the preservation of political and social order. Ginsberg stresses the importance of bureaucratic organization to effective violence and examines how apparently peaceful processes can still rest on the possibility of violence -- for example, the risk that security forces will attack a peaceful antigovernment protest. Despite his book’s title and his professed cynicism -- which reads more like frustrated idealism -- Ginsberg is not arguing that all violence is valuable: for example, he deals with the excesses of law enforcement agencies and criticizes U.S. foreign policy’s overreliance on war. Ginsberg suggests that activities that governments characterize as legitimate alternatives to violence, such as exercising “soft power,” in reality mostly serve as force multipliers. But this claim minimizes the qualitative differences between actual violence and coercive threats that simply set limits on behavior."

His latest provides a history of war games, which he defines very broadly to include almost any activity that links play and conflict, from gladiatorial combat, to jousting, to chess, to hunting, and to all manner of reenactments and simulations. Games can be played for a variety of purposes, from pure entertainment to dispute resolution, and can also represent serious preparation for the main business of war by allowing participants to learn how to use weapons, develop tactics, and understand how to anticipate the way conflicts develop. The book is held together by the richness of the material and van Creveld’s curiosity. Van Creveld is superb on the purposes and practices of gladiatorial combat and fascinating on how planners war-gamed some of the big moves of World War II; the Japanese, it turns out, first war-gamed an attack on Pearl Harbor in 1927. But van Creveld appears less comfortable exploring the world of computer games. And to judge from an awkward disquisition on why women have not been so enthusiastic about gaming, he should stay clear of gender issues.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

Parnas objected to Reagan’s “Star Wars” system because there was no sure way to remove the risk of a catastrophic failure, since there would be no way to find bugs in the system before it faced its first and possibly only great test. Why, asks Slayton, did it take so long for dilemmas like that one to take center stage in the debate over missile defense? She provides the answer in an original and engrossing study. Since the earliest days of thinking about missile defense, in the 1950s, the field had been dominated by physicists who were mostly preoccupied with the problem of identifying and tracking incoming warheads. Only when software specialists began to acquire more professional standing did their concerns come to the fore. In addition to providing new insights into the debate over missile defense, Slayton raises valuable questions about the broader interaction between scientific expertise and advocacy.

It is characteristic of fine French scholarship: abstract and logical but enlivened by numerous examples. The author tells readers how to think about problems in the current international political and economic system, but not exactly what to do about them. He is impressed by the system’s complexity but believes it is unstable and fragile, since relatively small perturbations could (but not necessarily will) lead to large and disturbing changes in the alignments among states and between states and increasingly important nonstate entities. This is a dense but thoughtful and thought-provoking book."

He presided over nearly two decades of U.S. economic prosperity, guided by a monetary policy protected and defended by his profoundly Delphic pronouncements. An economic forecaster in private life, he had as good a grasp of the U.S. economy as anyone, perhaps even better -- or so he thought. The financial crisis of 2008 was perhaps a greater shock to him than to many others, precisely because his understanding turned out to be badly off the mark. This book is his attempt to come to terms with those traumatic events. He identifies psychological propensities that influence economic and financial behavior and tries to find patterns in those propensities that might provide guidance to future economic forecasters. In addition to examining his own failure to appreciate the irrational elements of a seemingly rational economic system, he reflects on many other issues: the U.S. political system, now stalled by its inability to reach necessary compromises; American technology and education; and the excessive size of today’s largest financial institutions."
41,Dogfight; The Everything Store,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2014-02-18/dogfight-everything-store,Dogfight; The Everything Store,"Amazon, Apple, and Google are three firms that have helped define the early twenty-first century. All three are smashingly successful thanks to the Internet, whose value they contributed to developing. All three U.S.-based start-ups hardly existed (or did not exist at all) 25 years ago but have now joined the ranks of the world’s most highly valued firms. These easy-to-read books, written by accomplished and well-informed journalists, recount the companies’ origins, their evolutions, their rivalries, and their dependence on the visions and persistence of their founders, all of whom represent distinctive styles of leadership. The books also offer tribute to the many other people who contributed to the companies’ success and who typically became wealthy by working hard and by occasionally funding what began as highly uncertain ventures. The founders relied on quite different business models in the three cases, but they all pursued goals other than mere profitability, such as usefulness, beauty, and customer satisfaction. They were not inventors but rather innovators who were not bound by business conventions. It is worth remembering that people write books such as these about successful enterprises and not about the hundreds of similar efforts that did not succeed. But these success stories nevertheless provide encouragement to new efforts."

A Scorecard From 1900 to 2050,"In this interesting collection, expert analysts assess the costs of ten global problems over the past century, measured in economic terms, and make projections about their costs in 2050 (or 2100 in the case of climate change). The ten problems are air pollution, armed conflict, climate change, threats to ecosystems and bio­diversity, inadequate education, gender inequality, illness, malnutrition, trade barriers, and poor water and sanitation. Putting aside armed conflict, the past century has been a good one, in the sense that the estimated costs of these various problems were much higher at the beginning of the century than at the end. The book’s contributors expect such improvements to continue until the middle of this century, although they project that the costs associated with climate change will rise sharply toward the end of the century. The estimates the book provides are certain to be challenged, but there is value in its attempt to quantify the effects of problems that are typically discussed only in qualitative and often emotional terms and in the way it shows how much progress has been made -- and how much further the world needs to go."
43,The Memoirs of Walter Bagehot,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2014-02-18/memoirs-walter-bagehot,The Memoirs of Walter Bagehot,"Walter Bagehot (1826–77) is best known among economists for his oft-quoted views on how central banks should behave, in particular as lenders of last resort. He wrote prolifically -- a few books, but mainly articles for quarterly magazines and for The Economist, of which he became editor in 1861. But he wrote no memoirs. This unusual book is what Prochaska imagines Bagehot, once dubbed “the greatest Victorian,” might have produced. It provides a fascinating glimpse of British intellectual and practical life in the mid-nineteenth century, drawing extensively on Bagehot’s writings (in which he often mused on an enormous range of subjects), his letters, and the diaries of his wife. Bagehot was a banker who loved literature and poetry and who was blessed with an active, inquiring mind, stimulated by what he observed around him. He believed that economic principles yielded powerful insights but that the dullness of economic writing obscured those insights and made them difficult to apply, a state of affairs he tried to correct as an editor and writer for The Economist -- a tradition the magazine continues today."
44,Reflections on the Modern and the Global,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2014-02-18/reflections-modern-and-global,Reflections on the Modern and the Global,"In a series of short portraits of historical eras and their thinkers, Mazlish captures the changing ways that Western societies have understood the self and visualized the world as they moved from medieval to modern life, a process he calls “a seeing revolution.” The great humanists and scientists of the Renaissance, the Enlightenment, and the Industrial Revolution make appearances, including Alberti, Copernicus, Bacon, Galileo, Kepler, Descartes, Adam Smith, and Hegel. During these time periods, traditionalism and religion gave way to the modernizing forces of science and capitalism, which helped transform human consciousness and redefine ideas about the individual and his rights and capacities. The book’s most interesting claim is that consciousness is being reshaped yet again by the forces of globalization, although Mazlish does not properly define that process. The world is surely witnessing an intensification of interdependence and a spreading understanding of humanity as a unified community inhabiting a fragile planet. Yet the book does not squarely grapple with the most important question: If there is a growing global consciousness, what are its political consequences?"

But does it really influence the way governments behave? In this sophisticated study, Goodman and Jinks argue that international law affects states primarily through a process of socialization, in which state officials and other actors take on the beliefs and norms of others in their surrounding environment. Peer pressure, mimicry, identification, and the search for status are some of the factors that Goodman and Jinks believe bend states in the direction of the prevailing international human rights laws. The authors usefully summarize empirical studies that demonstrate that states have a tendency to imitate best practices in areas such as education, market liberalization, the environment, arms control, science policy, and human rights. The book leaves no doubt that in various circumstances, national decision-makers might well be motivated by social pressure and learning dynamics to adhere to internationally acceptable norms of state behavior. Although the book does not actually settle the question of when, how, and under what conditions states are socialized into accepting the prevailing norms of human rights, it suggests a rich agenda for further research."

Vol. 4, Globalizations, 1945–2011","With this volume, Mann, a renowned historical sociologist, completes his magisterial survey of power and society across human history, producing an almost breathtaking synthesis of modern history and social science that depicts the changing character of power and social relations in the post-1945 world system. In Mann’s view, that system is held up by three pillars: capitalism, the nation-state, and the United States, which Mann sees as the last remaining empire. Together, these three organizing forces drive forward globalization, the master process of the contemporary era. In this sense, globalization and the nation-state have been not rivals but companions, pushing and pulling the world into a single system. Mann argues that the United States is more willing to protect capitalism abroad than to safeguard democracy. But the book also shows a pragmatic American embrace of sovereignty and state capitalism among poorer nations, which allows for hegemonic, rather than imperial, U.S. domination. In the end, Mann thinks that a “multilateral order” will tackle global problems such as climate change better than a U.S.-centric one. This may be true, but after four seminal volumes about the role of power in world history, Mann’s post-American vision is strangely devoid of a serious discussion of the realities of power."
47,How Rivalries End,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2014-02-18/how-rivalries-end,How Rivalries End,"Scholars have noted that a very small group of states is responsible for most interstate disputes and wars. These strategic rivalries last for decades, periodically flaring up to threaten peace and security. This book represents one of the best efforts yet to understand why they emerge, persist, and, most important, end. The authors argue that de-escalation occurs when adversaries assume new understandings and expectations of their opponents. Such shifts sometimes occur after a crisis or shock pushes leaders in one or both states to question the viability of the conflict. The warming of U.S.-Chinese relations in the early 1970s, for example, was preceded by various shocks: the Tet offensive in Vietnam, Sino-Soviet border clashes, and the trauma of the Chinese Cultural Revolution. Shifts can also take place after new leaders come to power with new expectations, as was the case with the Egyptian-Israeli rivalry, which persisted for decades and subsided only after significant changes in both countries’ governments. The book might lead readers to wonder what sort of shock in Northeast Asia might fundamentally reorient relations between North and South Korea."

Reus-Smit argues that most accounts fail to explain why people wanted independent statehood in the first place. His answer is human rights. The book looks closely at the three great waves of state expansion: in Europe in the seventeenth century, in Latin America in the nineteenth century, and in the worldwide decolonization movements that took place after World War II. Reus-Smit argues that in each of those watershed periods, it was the struggle for human rights by subject people within empires that broke the old orders apart, triggering crises of legitimacy for imperial powers and paving the way for sovereign independence. At each juncture, the enemy of human rights was empire, and the vehicle for acquiring and protecting those rights was the sovereign state. The book is impressive, but Reus-Smit disregards the ideological and great-power struggles of the twentieth century, which played a critical role in dooming empire and allowing for the most recent expansion of sovereign self-determination."

The North American Free Trade Agreement has no provision for the free movement of labor, and no American or Canadian politician would dare suggest such a policy.

After leaving Nigeria to study economics at Harvard and then MIT, she spent two decades at the World Bank, eventually becoming a vice president. In 2003, Okonjo-Iweala returned to Nigeria to serve as finance minister in the administration of President Olusegun Obasanjo, but she resigned in frustration in 2006. (To opponents of her reform agenda, she had become known as “Okonjo-Wahala,” a play on the Hausa word for “trouble.”) After another stint at the World Bank, this time as a managing director, she was invited back to Nigeria by President Goodluck Jonathan in 2011 to head his economic team and once again take up the post of finance minister.

59,How China and America See Each Other,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/review-essay/2014-02-12/how-china-and-america-see-each-other,How China and America See Each Other,"It has become one of the most obvious clichés in international politics: the United States and China have the most important bilateral relationship in the world. What is not so obvious is the nature of that relationship. Until recently, most observers were willing to settle for an accurate but inelegant description: that the countries are neither friends nor foes."

61,Among the Believers,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/iran/2014-02-12/among-believers,Among the Believers,"In the early 1960s, Jalal Al-e Ahmad was one of Iran’s leading literary celebrities, a writer whose works deeply impressed the dissident clerics who would go on to found and lead the Islamic Republic. Born to a devout family in Tehran in 1923, a boy in the bazaar, Al-e Ahmad had drifted away from the faith and eventually earned a degree in Persian literature. He flirted with the communist Tudeh Party of Iran in the 1940s but broke with it for being too pro-Soviet; then, he helped found (and later left) a workers’ party that supported Mohammad Mosaddeq, who was elected prime minister of Iran in 1951. After the 1953 coup that toppled Mosaddeq, Al-e Ahmad succumbed to pressure from the shah’s regime and renounced politics entirely, publishing a letter “repenting” for his prior participation. He returned to his roots and seemed to find his vocation, becoming famous throughout Iran as a novelist, essayist, and underground polemicist, especially for his 1962 book Gharbzadegi, or “West-struck-ness” (published in English as Occidentosis or sometimes Westoxification)."
62,America’s Energy Edge,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/united-states/americas-energy-edge,America’s Energy Edge,"Only five years ago, the world’s supply of oil appeared to be peaking, and as conventional gas production declined in the United States, it seemed that the country would become dependent on costly natural gas imports. But in the years since, those predictions have proved spectacularly wrong. Global energy production has begun to shift away from traditional suppliers in Eurasia and the Middle East, as producers tap unconventional gas and oil resources around the world, from the waters of Australia, Brazil, Africa, and the Mediterranean to the oil sands of Alberta. The greatest revolution, however, has taken place in the United States, where producers have taken advantage of two newly viable technologies to unlock resources once deemed commercially infeasible: horizontal drilling, which allows wells to penetrate bands of shale deep underground, and hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, which uses the injection of high-pressure fluid to release gas and oil from rock formations."
63,(Mis)leading Indicators,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/world/misleading-indicators,(Mis)leading Indicators,"Economic numbers have come to define our world. Individuals, organizations, and governments assess how they are doing based on what these numbers tell them. Economists and analysts loosely refer to statistics measuring GDP, unemployment, inflation, and trade deficits as “leading indicators” and subscribe to the belief that these figures accurately reflect reality and provide unique insights into the health of an economy. Taken together, leading indicators create a data map that people use to navigate their lives. That map, however, is showing signs of age. Understanding where the map came from should help explain why it has become less reliable than ever before."
64,Networking Nature,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/world/networking-nature,Networking Nature,"Conservation is for the first time beginning to operate at the pace and on the scale necessary to keep up with, and even get ahead of, the planet’s most intractable environmental challenges. New technologies have given conservationists abilities that would have seemed like super powers just a few years ago. We can now monitor entire ecosystems -- think of the Amazon rainforest -- in nearly real time, using remote sensors to map their three-dimensional structures; satellite communications to follow elusive creatures, such as the jaguar and the puma; and smartphones to report illegal logging."
65,The Next Drone Wars,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/united-states/next-drone-wars,The Next Drone Wars,"During World War II, a top commander in what was then the U.S. Army Air Forces, General Henry “Hap” Arnold, developed a new way to attack U-boat stations and other heavily fortified German positions: he turned old B-17 and B-24 bombers into remotely piloted aircraft and loaded them with explosives. “If you can get mechanical machines to do this,” Arnold wrote in a memo to his staff, “you are saving lives at the outset.” The missions had a poor track record, but that did not deter Arnold from declaring in 1945 that “the next war may be fought by airplanes with no men in them at all.”"
66,As Objects Go Online,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/objects-go-online,As Objects Go Online,"Since 1969, when the first bit of data was transmitted over what would come to be known as the Internet, that global network has evolved from linking mainframe computers to connecting personal computers and now mobile devices. By 2010, the number of computers on the Internet had surpassed the number of people on earth."
67,The Key to Successful Tech Management,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2014-02-12/key-successful-tech-management,The Key to Successful Tech Management,"Late last October, the management expert Jeffrey Zients was given a mandate to fix HealthCare.gov, the website at the forefront of U.S. President Barack Obama’s health-care reform, after its disastrous launch. Refusing to engage in happy talk about how well things were going or how soon everything would be fixed, Zients established performance metrics for the site’s responsiveness, insisted on improvements to the underlying hardware, postponed work on nonessential features, demanded rapid reporting of significant problems, and took management oversight away from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS, a federal agency within the Department of Health and Human Services) and gave it instead to a single contractor reporting to him. The result was a newly productive work environment that helped the website progress from grave dysfunction in early October to passable effectiveness two months later."
68,Failure to Launch,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2014-02-12/failure-launch,Failure to Launch,"President Barack Obama has often said that his proudest domestic achievement is the passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (commonly known as the ACA or Obamacare). The sprawling law, pushed through Congress in 2010 in the face of fierce Republican resistance, made numerous important changes to the U.S. health-care system -- a system so big that, on its own, it represents an economy about the size of France’s."
69,Privacy Pragmatism,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/world/privacy-pragmatism,Privacy Pragmatism,"Ever since the Internet became a mass social phenomenon in the 1990s, people have worried about its effects on their privacy. From time to time, a major scandal has erupted, focusing attention on those anxieties; last year’s revelations concerning the U.S. National Security Agency’s surveillance of electronic communications are only the most recent example. In most cases, the subsequent debate has been about who should be able to collect and store personal data and how they should be able to go about it. When people hear or read about the issue, they tend to worry about who has access to information about their health, their finances, their relationships, and their political activities."
70,The Indian in the Closet,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/india/2014-02-12/indian-closet,The Indian in the Closet,"On a bright January day, a group of around 200 lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) activists dressed in black, to symbolize mourning, gathered at Jantar Mantar, a site in New Delhi that frequently plays host to protests and demonstrations. Nearby, khaki-clad police officers warily observed the spectacle. The activists clutched rainbow flags to their chests and shouted slogans."
71,Eastern Europe Goes South,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/southeastern-europe/2014-02-12/eastern-europe-goes-south,Eastern Europe Goes South,"Europeans love to celebrate anniversaries, especially those commemorating a terrible past overcome. This year will offer many such moments, marking as it will 100 years since the outbreak of World War I, 75 years since the beginning of World War II, and, most uplifting of all, a quarter century since the fall of the Berlin Wall. Such milestones are bound to make everyone feel good about European unity."
72,The Mobile-Finance Revolution,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/africa/2014-02-12/mobile-finance-revolution,The Mobile-Finance Revolution,"The roughly 2.5 billion people in the world who live on less than $2 a day are not destined to remain in a state of chronic poverty. Every few years, somewhere between ten and 30 percent of the world’s poorest households manage to escape poverty, typically by finding steady employment or through entrepreneurial activities such as growing a business or improving agricultural harvests. During that same period, however, roughly an equal number of households slip below the poverty line. Health-related emergencies are the most common cause, but there are many more: crop failures, livestock deaths, farming-equipment breakdowns, even wedding expenses."
73,Moscow and the Mosque,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/russian-federation/2014-02-06/moscow-and-mosque,Moscow and the Mosque,"If Russians were holding their breath in the run-up to the 2014 Winter Olympics, it was with good reason. A Black Sea spa town long favored by Kremlin apparatchiks, Sochi occupies a perilous position on Russia’s southern frontier, just 50 miles west of the North Caucasus Federal District, a cauldron of ethnic strife, nationalist separatism, and state repression since the collapse of the Soviet Union. In the last two years alone, violence in this vast mountainous region, including car bombings, assassinations, and clashes between Muslim fighters and Russian security forces, has killed or injured more than 1,500 people."

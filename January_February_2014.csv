0,The Shape of Things to Come,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/issue-packages/2013-12-06/shape-things-come,What’s Inside,"The idea that we live in an increasingly interconnected and turbulent world is something of a cliché -- yet true and important nevertheless. Decisions made by the U.S. Federal Reserve affect the purchasing power of villagers in southern Thailand; consumer demand in Europe and North America affects the output of factory workers in eastern China, which affects the jobs of oil workers in Brazil, Russia, and elsewhere. Elite investors now routinely send their capital abroad in a ceaseless quest for new opportunities and high returns; whether they realize it or not, hundreds of millions of less highflying people do the same indirectly, through their mutual or pension funds. So global economic forecasting -- trying to look past current events to glimpse what’s coming over the horizon -- has become an exercise of general, not specialized, concern."
1,Success in Africa: CEO Insights From a Continent on the Rise,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2013-12-17/success-africa-ceo-insights-continent-rise,Success in Africa: CEO Insights From a Continent on the Rise,"This breezy, upbeat appraisal of the merits of Africa’s private sector and its boundless potential to spearhead growth would have been unthinkable a decade ago. The prose sometimes descends into generic M.B.A.-speak, but Berman produces real insight by giving voice to African entrepreneurs themselves, through lengthy quotations. His interlocutors represent a new class of risk-taking businesspeople who benefit from the region’s newly investor-friendly business climate. Berman does not offer analyses of particular sectors -- he barely mentions manufacturing or commodities such as oil and gold -- and he makes few meaningful distinctions among the region’s 54 countries. Instead, he chronicles individual companies that have enjoyed success by entering expanding markets, capitalizing on local knowledge, and demonstrating resilience. This might sound like an obvious recipe for success. But why, then, did so few experts anticipate the current boom?"
2,Political Parties in Africa: Ethnicity and Party Formation,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2013-12-17/political-parties-africa-ethnicity-and-party-formation,Political Parties in Africa: Ethnicity and Party Formation,"Many assume that ethnic identity plays the main role in holding African political parties together. Yet as Elischer shows in this careful analysis of ten African countries, the picture is more complicated. In some countries, such as Kenya, parties are indeed organized largely along ethnic lines -- mostly, Elischer argues, because no single ethnic group dominates and a number of ethnic groups each account for more than ten percent of the citizenry and can thus aspire to electoral success on the basis of ethnic loyalty. But Elischer shows that in other countries, especially ones in which there is a large core ethnic group, political parties make fewer appeals based on ethnicity, instead defining themselves through economic and social policies or by rallying around a charismatic politician. Elischer’s book is empirically sound and well argued; it is the best analysis of this subject to date."
3,Integrating Africa; Region-Building in Southern Africa,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2013-12-17/integrating-africa-region-building-southern-africa,Integrating Africa; Region-Building in Southern Africa,"Analysts frequently note the lack of economic integration and political cooperation among the 54 states of Africa -- an ironic state of affairs, perhaps, given the large number of intergovernmental organizations that exist on the continent. Welz examines the foreign policy of eight countries in the region to understand why the member states of the Africa Union, the region’s primary institution of regional integration, have not devoted more energy to realizing the organization’s lofty aims. He mostly blames domestic politics, especially the personalization of power by heads of state, which tends to undermine commitments that countries make to greater international cooperation. The book also makes an interesting observation: countries still governed by parties that participated in anticolonial struggles are more reticent to give up sovereignty. Welz concludes that the passage of time and the continued democratization of the region are prerequisites for more meaningful regional cooperation."
4,To the Ends of the Earth: Pentecostalism and the Transformation of World Christianity,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2013-12-17/ends-earth-pentecostalism-and-transformation-world-christianity,To the Ends of the Earth: Pentecostalism and the Transformation of World Christianity,"The various currents that make up Pentecostalism represent the fastest-growing Christian denomination in Africa. In this sympathetic survey, Anderson, a former Pentecostal minister, argues that Pentecostalism in Africa must be understood more as an indigenous religion than as a Western one. Pentecostal missionaries introduced the faith into the “global South,” including Africa, during the early twentieth century, but the churches soon began to develop autonomously. Unlike churches belonging to traditional Christian sects, Pentecostal churches were decentralized, nonhierarchical, and independent of colonial authorities, making them more likely to take on native leadership, adapt to local cultural norms, and connect with the nationalist sentiments of newly urbanized and socially mobile Africans. In addition, the relentless proselytizing required by Pentecostal theology ensured that there would be plenty of converts and led to steady growth during the entire twentieth century. Today, more than 100 million Africans belong to Pentecostal churches, making Anderson’s book essential reading for anyone interested in the sociology of contemporary Africa."
5,Wealth and Power: China’s Long March to the Twenty-first Century,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2013-12-17/wealth-and-power-chinas-long-march-twenty-first-century,Wealth and Power: China’s Long March to the Twenty-first Century,"Each year, scores of books appear purporting to explain where China has been, where it is now, and where it is going. Rare, however, is a book such as this one, which offers genuinely new insights into this vast and complicated country. Schell and Delury argue that for most of China’s recent history, the country has been consumed with the search for wealth and power: the desire to “see China return to greatness and honor.” They explore the debates and often fierce political battles that surround this quest through a series of fascinating portraits of Chinese thinkers and leaders. The cast of characters is wide-ranging. Some of those profiled, such as Mao Zedong, are familiar; others, such as the Qing dynasty scholar Wei Yuan, will be new to most readers. One of the book’s greatest strengths is its authors’ lack of ideological bias in selecting their subjects: few would think to place the much-reviled nineteenth-century empress dowager Cixi alongside the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize winner Liu Xiaobo. The portraits are beautifully written and bring to life not only their subjects but also the mood and intellectual debates of the times in which they lived."
6,We Didn’t Start the Fire: My Struggle for Democracy in Cambodia,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2013-12-17/we-didnt-start-fire-my-struggle-democracy-cambodia,We Didn’t Start the Fire: My Struggle for Democracy in Cambodia,"Sam Rainsy’s Cambodia National Rescue Party won a surprising 47 percent of the vote in the country’s National Assembly elections last summer, capping a series of contests during the past 20 years in which the party, under various names, won a growing vote share despite electoral manipulation and violence meted out by the ruling Cambodian People’s Party of Prime Minister Hun Sen. To explain his commitment to confronting Cambodia’s entrenched elite in the face of legal persecution and assassination attempts, Sam Rainsy has written an autobiography that reaches back to his childhood, his father’s exile and assassination, his work in Paris as a financial manager, and his interest in the Moral Re-Armament movement and Buddhism. The book is also a manifesto pitched to foreign governments and nongovernmental organizations, asking them to stop propping up the Hun Sen regime with development aid. In it, Sam Rainsy explains how he would combat corruption, land grabbing, nepotism, patronage, and other ills if he came to power."
7,Media Commercialization and Authoritarian Rule in China,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2013-12-17/media-commercialization-and-authoritarian-rule-china,Media Commercialization and Authoritarian Rule in China,"Chinese media have changed since the gray days of Maoism. There are now nearly 2,000 newspapers, 10,000 periodicals, and hundreds of radio and TV stations with a wide variety of styles and features. All but a few have to support themselves with advertising and subscriptions, spurring fierce competition for readers and listeners. But contrary to the conventional wisdom, Stockmann argues that media commercialization has strengthened, rather than weakened, the Communist Party’s rule. Today’s media cover fashion, sports, business, and a host of other subjects in a wide range of styles, which enables them to attract more readers and listeners. Audiences place greater trust in outlets they select for themselves than they did in the more tightly controlled, less diverse media of the past. Meanwhile, the Communist Party still has the power to shape the message whenever it feels the need to, including by firing reporters who get too far out of line. Stockmann finds that the Propaganda Department more often uses its authority to tamp down, rather than ramp up, nationalist sentiment against the United States and Japan, lest popular anger turn against the party itself. By reporting more aggressively, the media give the leadership better information about what the public thinks than they did in the past, which helps the government address problems that might otherwise lead to unrest."
8,"Forgotten Ally: China’s World War II, 1937–1945",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2013-12-17/forgotten-ally-chinas-world-war-ii-1937-1945,"Forgotten Ally: China’s World War II, 1937–1945","Mitter applies historical empathy to yield fresh insights into the situations of all the actors in the horrific conflict that the Chinese call the War of Resistance Against Japan, which lasted from 1937 to 1945. He pays particular attention to China’s leaders, explaining Chiang Kai-shek’s decision to breach the dikes of the Yellow River, an act that killed half a million of his countrymen; Mao Zedong’s preference for a protracted guerrilla strategy against the Japanese; and Wang Jingwei’s decision to collaborate with the Japanese occupiers. But he also recounts the frustrations of Japanese infantrymen that led them to behave so viciously in occupied Chinese cities. The only person Mitter fully condemns is U.S. General Joseph “Vinegar Joe” Stilwell, often portrayed as a hero in earlier accounts but whom Mitter charges with blinkered egoism in his clashes with Chiang. The narrative also tells the stories of soldiers, refugees, missionaries, and journalists, creating an exceptionally full narrative of a fateful period whose legacies still shape China; these include a broader sense of national identity, modern techniques of mass mobilization and propaganda, a large role for the state in providing for the needs of the people, and a culture of violence."
9,The China Story (www.thechinastory.org),https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2013-12-17/china-story-wwwthechinastoryorg,The China Story (www.thechinastory.org),"Among a growing number of websites and e-mail newsletters providing insight on China, the China Story stands out for the richness of its coverage of Chinese culture and history. The site is guided by the veteran Sinologist Geremie Barmé and informed by what he calls “New Sinology,” which emphasizes the continuity of China’s contemporary problems and debates with those of the country’s past. The material is infused with Barmé’s taste for the unconventional, affection for the Chinese language, and alternately playful and acerbic writing style. The site’s sketches of leading Chinese thinkers illustrate the vitality of Chinese intellectual life despite the state’s efforts to control it. The site also provides access to the China Story Yearbook series, which covers politics, law, foreign policy, the blogosphere, and other subjects, and to the online journal China Heritage Quarterly, which carries articles about the presence of the past in Chinese architecture, culture, and literature."
10,An Uncertain Glory: India and Its Contradictions,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2013-12-17/uncertain-glory-india-and-its-contradictions,An Uncertain Glory: India and Its Contradictions,"India has experienced two decades of rapid economic growth, yet half of Indian households lack indoor toilets, nearly 40 percent of the country’s adults are illiterate, immunization rates there are among the lowest in the world, and 43 percent of its children are underweight. The benefits of growth have flowed to the top 20 percent of the population, while the profoundly poor -- who represent 28 to 80 percent of the population, depending on where the line is drawn -- have gained little. The authors, two distinguished economists, use unfavorable comparisons with Bangladesh, China, and the countries of sub-Saharan Africa, among other places, to shame India’s politicians, corrupt bureaucrats, media, and self-interested economic elites, whom they blame collectively for the country’s pattern of “biased growth.” Against those who want to address poverty through further market reforms, Drèze and Sen argue that India needs more (albeit better-run) public services and redistributive social programs. But given the scope and severity of the problems they describe, it seems like a leap of faith to argue, as they do, that the system can right itself by means of “public reason” and greater political pressure from the poor."
11,Hezbollah: The Global Footprint of Lebanon’s Party of God,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2013-12-17/hezbollah-global-footprint-lebanons-party-god,Hezbollah: The Global Footprint of Lebanon’s Party of God,"In this book, Levitt, a former deputy assistant secretary in the U.S. Treasury Department, focuses on Hezbollah’s operations outside Lebanon in near-excruciating detail. He presents an avalanche of evidence that Hezbollah is a global terrorist organization and demonstrates that its links to Iran are strong and organic. Levitt relies on declassified intelligence, court documents, and other sources in the public domain to delve into familiar (albeit horrifying) crimes often linked to Hezbollah, including the deadly 1994 bombing of a Jewish community center in Buenos Aires and the 1996 attack in Khobar, Saudi Arabia, that killed 19 U.S. military personnel. But Levitt does not offer much analysis of these events and makes little effort to situate them in a broader consideration of Hezbollah’s tactics and strategy. The main takeaway from his book is that Hezbollah’s overarching objective is to destroy Israel and drive the United States from any effective presence in the Middle East, and that its foreign operations also serve the purpose of revenge -- above all for the assassination of the group’s strategic mastermind, Imad Mugniyah, in February 2008."

The Haqqani patriarch, Jalaluddin Haqqani, and his son Sirajuddin Haqqani guide their organization with a combination of fierce resistance to central authorities and a less-than-strict practice of Islam. Above all, they want to preserve control of their homeland, which has served as a safe haven for al Qaeda and as a supply route through which Pakistan’s intelligence service ships materiel to the Taliban and others in Afghanistan. Brown and Rassler argue that the Haqqanis have played a greater role in the region’s anti-American jihad than has al Qaeda -- despite the fact that Washington assisted the Haqqanis’ resistance to the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan during the 1980s. They speculate that after the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, al Qaeda and the Haqqanis might refocus on India, Kashmir, and the Central Asian states. Brown and Rassler have assembled unique and impressive evidence for their arguments, shining a light into some hitherto dark corners."
13,Roots of the Arab Spring: Contested Authority and Political Change in the Middle East,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2013-12-17/roots-arab-spring-contested-authority-and-political-change-middle,Roots of the Arab Spring: Contested Authority and Political Change in the Middle East,"Should Western governments have seen the Arab Spring coming? Rand, who is currently serving on the U.S. National Security Council, carried out the research for this revealing book in Bahrain, Morocco, and Tunisia well before the region was rocked by popular revolts in 2011. She believes the West should have sensed that something was coming, since systemic changes had already been roiling Arab societies for some time. Her explanation acknowledges but does not stress the role of structural factors, such as youth unemployment, in producing the 2011 uprisings. Rather, she focuses on the economic liberalization campaigns that Arab governments launched in the 1990s and early years of this century, in part to placate internal opposition and respond to pressure from the West to reform. But the regimes soon began to reverse those reforms, which they believed had encouraged unwanted dissent. The reversals were meant to stifle opposition but served only to encourage more of it. Through top-down, antidemocratic constitutional and legal maneuvers, Arab regimes sent a message that bargaining for change was futile and so, too, was the quest for incremental reform. For many dissidents, that meant the only hope for change was the fall of the regimes."
14,"Unthinkable: Iran, the Bomb, and American Strategy",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2013-12-15/unthinkable-iran-bomb-and-american-strategy,"Unthinkable: Iran, the Bomb, and American Strategy","This book will be read carefully in Tehran, Washington, and Tel Aviv. Pollack lays out the strategic factors the United States must take into account when deciding how to deal with Iran’s nuclear program, covering nearly all contingencies, including military action. He argues forcefully that, should negotiations fail, Washington should opt for containment instead of military action. His case is lucid and compelling; he reminds readers that a U.S. air campaign that failed to set back Iran’s nuclear development for more than several years would probably lead to a U.S. ground invasion that would make the Iraq war look relatively simple. More provocatively, Pollack advocates combining containment with efforts at regime change, arguing that Iran does not moderate when the pressure is off but rather when it is high. He dismisses the idea that so long as Iran’s supreme leader believes the United States seeks to end the Islamic Republic, he and his supporters will have little incentive to reach agreement with Washington on the nuclear issue. Iran, Pollack argues, is aggressive but rational. It would not use nuclear weapons unprovoked. It would not share them with third parties such as Hezbollah. It would only use them to defend itself."

Both studies confirm that the Syrian civil war presents stakeholders with many options, all of them bad. The first book was assembled at the beginning of 2013, and the second, midyear. Since then, with the exception of the U.S.-Russian agreement that paved the way for Syria to give up its chemical weapons arsenal, none of the basic elements in the Syrian conflict have changed -- except that the casualties and refugee flows have increased significantly."

The principal venue in the post-Stalinist Soviet Union for reflections -- narrow at first and then inexorably widening -- on the Soviet Union’s history was the venerated literary journal Novyi Mir (New World). The journal shot to prominence in 1953 with its publication of an essay on sincerity in literature, written by the critic Vladimir Pomerantsev. Western literary critics accustomed to scarcely a ripple of attention might find it hard to believe, but the piece stirred a storm of controversy in newspapers, universities, and even factories. More than 700 letters flooded the journal’s offices, some of them longer than 30 handwritten pages. Other provocations followed, each pushing deeper into the dehumanized reality of the Soviet experience and each generating agitated responses. With the opening of the archives of the journal and of its bureaucratic keepers, Kozlov gained access to tens of thousands of unpublished letters from readers as well as the records of editorial meetings and accounts of the authorities scrambling to respond to the latest controversies. This fine history reveals the society-changing power of what Kozlov calls “the relationship between texts and readers.”"

Gordy zeroes in on how Serbs have (or have not) come to terms with the war crimes and crimes against humanity committed by their leaders and prosecuted before the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. Judging the Serbian public mind is not easy. Gordy, by going beyond merely examining the legal dramas and public opinion polls, discovered that most Serbs see the issues of guilt and responsibility in wavering shades, not stark colors. The Serbian people, he concludes, have come a good distance. But denialism lingers, for which he assigns considerable blame to the non-Serbian prosecutors at the tribunal, who have failed to clearly convey to the Serbs the full, convincing weight of the evidence against their former leaders. Gordy delivers his judgment of all the parties with sensitivity and compassion."

She is interested in why ethnonationalist conflicts vary in the level of violence they generate, why violence at whatever level persists, and when and why things change for the better or the worse. To get at the answers, she explores three cases, similar in their characteristics but different in their outcomes: Bulgaria (where majority-minority conflict has been free of violence), Kosovo (where it has not), and Macedonia (somewhere in between). Elaborate but lucid theorizing informs her explanations, at the heart of which are what she calls “critical junctures” -- the historical moments (such as the aftermath of Soviet communism) when majority-minority relationships form in a way that encourages either accommodation or resistance. The conditions that develop in those brief periods tend to harden, improving or deteriorating only as the result of external shocks or incremental change."
19,Danubia: A Personal History of Habsburg Europe,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2013-12-15/danubia-personal-history-habsburg-europe,Danubia: A Personal History of Habsburg Europe,"Making five centuries of Habsburg history fun seems like a tall order, but Winder pulls it off. He entertains because he is entertained. His sprawling history of a dynastic empire that began in the early twelfth century and finally unraveled in 1918 is a personal travelogue; over many journeys, he foraged in both the famous and the obscure historical sites of central and southern Europe, detailing here what they represented in their day. With unrelenting wit -- sometimes smirking but also self-mocking -- he traces the Habsburgs’ fortunes: their ascendance to the throne of the Holy Roman Empire in the fifteenth century; the division of the family into Austrian and Spanish houses in the sixteenth century; and the Austro-Hungarian Empire’s central role in all of modern Europe’s dramas, from the French Revolution to World War I. What gives the text verve is Winder’s ability to interweave the eccentric details of the Habsburgs themselves with an absorbing cultural history, driven by his exuberant passion for the lives and music of great composers and textured by his skillful physical descriptions of forgotten corners of the realm."
20,"Russia, the West, and Military Intervention",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2013-12-15/russia-west-and-military-intervention,"Russia, the West, and Military Intervention","No issue has more vexed recent U.S.-Russian relations than the tension over military interventions, such as those launched or backed by Washington in Kosovo, Iraq, and Libya and the one carried out by Russia in Georgia. Analysts have paid too little attention to the roots of this tension, which lie in the conflicting normative and legal standards each side has used to justify its actions. It takes a scholar as meticulous and thorough as Allison to properly chronicle the remarkably complex debate between proponents of traditional norms of state sovereignty and advocates for new norms of humanitarian interventionism. In this clash, the Russians -- like the Chinese, the Indians, and many others -- align themselves with the conservative, pro-sovereignty side of the argument, a position that owes as much to self-interest as to principle. Yet the Russians have struggled to be consistent. Although doing so is not his overt purpose, Allison demonstrates how if U.S. and western European analysts ignore or discount this dimension of Russian thinking, their explanations of Russian behavior in controversies over intervention (including in the Syrian civil war) will be shallow."

His case, however, is neither strident nor crude. On the contrary, Sherr subtly traces the historical roots and complex character of Russian power. His starting point is the political scientist Joseph Nye’s notion of “soft power.” But in his examination of Russia’s relations with states that were once within the Soviet Union’s borders or that were part of the extended Soviet empire, Sherr reveals the Russian approach to instruments of influence -- trade, energy, the Russian Orthodox Church, and Russian cultural exports -- as more brutal than dulcet. He interprets the fundamental impulse behind Russian policy as a desire to create an international environment that protects the Russian regime’s preferred domestic order, but he views the steps Russia takes to further that stark agenda as intricate and artful. As for the policy’s success, Sherr’s judgment lingers between mixed and suspended. As for the policy’s permanence, he allows for the possibility of change -- perhaps, ultimately, out of necessity."
22,Latin American Populism in the Twenty-first Century,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2013-12-15/latin-american-populism-twenty-first-century,Latin American Populism in the Twenty-first Century,"During the twentieth century, a majority of the countries in Latin America developed market economies and representative democracies. Yet in some of these countries, the promises of a liberal society did not match the magnitude of citizens’ demands, provoking calls for democracies that were more representative and for states that were more active in the production and distribution of goods and services. Latin American leaders including Hugo Chávez of Venezuela, Evo Morales of Bolivia, Rafael Correa of Ecuador, the Kirchners of Argentina, and even Álvaro Uribe of Colombia all rose to power partly through promises to be more effective and just in the mediation between citizen demands and state resources. Chávez shared so generously with his supporters that Venezuela’s petroleum revenues proved insufficient to cover the runaway costs. Morales, for his part, has also shared with his supporters, but he has managed to maintain budget discipline, taking advantage of high commodity export prices. De la Torre and Arnson’s volume addresses these varieties of populism, concluding with a wide-ranging essay by the editors that analyzes the continuing significance of this durable political phenomenon in Latin America."

Hirschman,"This is a wonderful book about a superb political economist. Adelman invested many years in this admiring biography, which allows readers to fully appreciate the diversity of Albert Hirschman’s many contributions to economic scholarship; it also does not fail to offer occasional criticisms. Hirschman never won a Nobel Prize in Economics, but his writing did lead to the emergence of political economy as a central field within the social sciences in the United States. Hirschman’s 1970 book, Exit, Voice, and Loyalty, generated an immense positive response on its appearance, although primarily from political scientists, rather than economists. Hirschman possessed a unique ability to shift from the particular to the general and projected an implicit optimism about humanity’s prospects. He did not enjoy teaching -- to put it mildly. But he was able to profoundly influence two generations of students who have greatly benefited from reading his works, which have proved especially useful for those who study development issues in Latin America, a region to which Hirschman paid particular attention.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

Extensively referencing commentators such as Joseph Stiglitz, Niall Ferguson, and Kishore Mahbubani, Toro Hardy gleefully depicts U.S. society as trapped in a self-destructive orgy, as myopic corporations and deadlocked politicians lose all sense of the national interest, while the Chinese Community Party brilliantly masters technological innovation and gains global leadership. A more multicultural, multipolar world will present exciting opportunities for Latin America, but only if the region draws the right lessons from its checkered past, conserves earnings from high commodity prices in sovereign wealth funds, further diversifies its exports to include modern goods and services (pop music, software development, product design, and so on), and develops its human capital and physical infrastructure. Most interesting, Toro Hardy urges Latin American diplomats to unite as a block and negotiate a grand bargain with China in order to integrate their economies into Chinese industrial value chains and to obtain more access to Chinese capital and technology."
25,The Economic Development of Latin America Since Independence,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2013-12-17/economic-development-latin-america-independence,The Economic Development of Latin America Since Independence,"This well-argued interpretive economic history is reasonably balanced in its assessment of the region’s progress and shortcomings, even as it leans toward the neostructuralist school of thought and the approach associated with the UN Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean, both of which favor state activism. The distinguished authors consider four major historical periods: the chaotic postcolonial era (1810–70), the first great wave of globalization and commodity exports (1870–1929), the era dominated by the kind of state-led industrialization that Bértola and Ocampo prefer (the 1930s through the 1970s), and the recent turn back toward market mechanisms, which they view with some skepticism. During the golden age of state-led growth, development strategies promoted national industries and domestic markets and the public sector’s delivery of education and health services. But adjustments became necessary, the authors recognize, and the book identifies four main ingredients for promoting sustainable growth going forward: sound macroeconomic management to confront global vulnerabilities, energetic competitiveness and technology policies, strong governance institutions (although the optimal mix of state and market varies across countries), and equity agendas to encourage more just distributions of wealth."
26,The Structure of Cuban History: Meanings and Purpose of the Past,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2013-12-17/structure-cuban-history-meanings-and-purpose-past,The Structure of Cuban History: Meanings and Purpose of the Past,"Pérez, a masterful historian of Cuba, argues that whether Fidel Castro was motivated by heartfelt convictions or political opportunism, the Cuban leader undeniably understood the power of the past to drive contemporary politics. From the outset, Castro associated himself with the images and purposes of Cuba’s national heroes and martyrs, casting himself as the standard-bearer of a hundred years of extraordinarily bloody struggles for national identity and dignity in the face of foreign imperialism -- first Spanish, then American. Overtly hostile U.S. administrations inadvertently strengthened Castro’s nationalist credentials. Inherent in Cubans’ aspirations for sovereignty was an anticipation of improved material conditions; more controversial, however, was Castro’s claim that the logical destiny of Cuban history was a radical social revolution. Today, deprived Cuban youth are less interested in historical slogans than in better living standards, portending a reinterpretation of the past. As Pérez concludes, “A history that had failed to fulfill the promise of its premise [risks] being discarded as irrelevant,” perhaps giving rise to a “counterfactual history, with a host of what-ifs” -- especially the question of what might have been had the United States not tried to subvert the Cuban Revolution, which Pérez refers to as “the noble gesture of 1959.”"

In his fast-paced, engrossing account, Schmidli chronicles the fierce internal struggles within the White House and the State Department, where political appointees dedicated to transforming Carter’s idealism into concrete policies battled career diplomats accustomed to maintaining cordial relations with anticommunist regimes such as Argentina’s. Schmidli concludes that, despite subsequent policy vacillations, the United States extracted some important concessions from the Argentine junta, saving many lives. More broadly, the Carter team succeeded in institutionalizing human rights in U.S. foreign policy: after some early backsliding, the Reagan administration deemed democracy promotion the core of its Argentina policy, which Schmidli describes as an “unmistakable validation for U.S. human rights advocates’ struggle.” Drawing on declassified documents and personal interviews, Schmidli paints colorful portraits of key players in the policy debates. More interviews of Argentines would have rounded out the picture. But this very valuable study also underscores the vital roles of human rights activists and Congress in laying the foundations for Carter’s diplomatic offensive."
28,The Fall of the Celtic Tiger: Ireland and the Euro Debt Crisis,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2013-12-17/fall-celtic-tiger-ireland-and-euro-debt-crisis,The Fall of the Celtic Tiger: Ireland and the Euro Debt Crisis,"Although its subject matter and the text itself are a bit dry, this book is the best so far on the Irish financial crisis of 2008. The authors trace the well-known contours of the financial crisis that swept over Ireland, the government’s response, and the debate that has followed. They explain how an investment boom triggered a housing bubble. When the bubble burst, it took the banking sector with it. Private actors were at best shortsighted and at worst criminal, and public authorities, notably the Central Bank of Ireland, failed to discharge their regulatory duties. The fact that during the boom, politicians failed to push against the irrational optimism of the financial sector reflects the cozy personal style of Irish politics. The media and economists failed to inform the public about the growing risks. The authors conclude that the government had no practical alternative to issuing a much-criticized comprehensive bank guarantee, which, combined with irresponsible government borrowing and spending during the boom years, quickly fueled public-sector deficits."

Technocrats draw on specific experiences elsewhere to fine-tune domestic policy proposals. More surprising, everyday voters -- even in a country with an exceptionalist self-image, such as the United States -- see the adoption of policies by other large countries as a signal that the proposals are feasible and fair. This would seem utterly implausible if Linos did not document it with public opinion data and historical case studies from Greece, Spain, and the United States. For scholars, the book poses as many questions as it answers. For policymakers, it suggests novel ways to build support for policy innovations."

Occasionally, however, a scholarly book emerges whose scope, clarity, and focus on a vital issue allow it to cross the theory-praxis divide. This latest edition of van Schendelen’s classic work synthesizes the most important lessons that political scientists, management scholars, and the best public affairs professionals have learned about how to lobby the European Union. Mastering the EU process is hard, as the five pages of abbreviations at the beginning of the book attest. Yet knowledge helps lobbyists pick which buttons to push when dealing with EU policymakers. Although the book is not an easy read, it makes even complex questions -- such as whether lobbyists are a force for Europe’s democratic legitimacy -- concrete and accessible to the average reader. It is hard to imagine anyone succeeding in Brussels without knowing what is in this unique volume."

To a surprising extent, they find that politics and ideology, rather than the sheer moral horror of violence, have determined what subsequently registered as a painful and traumatic event, defined who was treated as a perpetrator or a victim, and dictated who deserved restitution. Political polarization leads Colombians to view kidnappings as individual private misfortunes rather than public problems. One-party rule led Poland to suppress the true story of the Katyn massacre of 1940, in which Soviet secret police forces killed more than 20,000 Polish nationals. The Holocaust sensitized the world to Jewish suffering yet desensitized many Israelis to Palestinian suffering. Germans view the Allied bombing of World War II as deserved retribution, whereas the Japanese view it as a complex and ambiguous national trauma. Readers might disagree with these conclusions, but the book makes a convincing case that the moral lessons of the last century remain ambiguous and contested."

These two books help illuminate how contemporary espionage took shape. Jeffreys-Jones focuses on Anglo-American intelligence cooperation, arguing that its finest hours were during World War II and in the early stages of the Cold War. By the 1960s, the British could no longer keep up with either U.S. technological prowess or the Americans’ unilateral impulsiveness. The relationship fell into decline; today, it is no longer special."

The war was ostensibly fought over British attempts to restrict U.S. trade and force sailors on American-flagged vessels into service in the British Royal Navy. It was, however, vehemently opposed by most U.S. trading and mercantile interests and was most strongly supported by farmers and other interior dwellers. One of the many merits of this volume is that, through speeches and accounts of official meetings, readers are able to see the war through the eyes of the defeated -- and there was no group for whom the War of 1812 was a worse disaster than Native Americans. Ultimately deserted by their British allies, the Native American tribes who lived between the Appalachian Mountains and the Mississippi River suffered a series of defeats at the hands of American forces that left them defenseless before the accelerating tide of settlement along the frontier."

In this brave and bracing book, Joffe treats these repeated failed prophecies to the merciless debunking they deserve. Envious foreigners and nervous Americans alike have predicted the imminent demise of American power due to an allegedly failed educational system, the superior performance of foreign rivals, budget and trade deficits stemming back to the Kennedy era, imperial hubris, and assorted other maladies. Joffe makes a strong case that a mix of Chinese vulnerabilities and American strengths means it is unlikely that China will replace the United States anytime soon as the center of the global system. Yet, as Joffe notes, constant anxiety about the United States’ prospects might be one of the cultural forces responsible for the country’s persistent strength; rather than resting on their laurels, Americans continually and even neurotically poke at their social fabric, looking for tears that need mending."

His description of that school of thought alone makes this book worth reading. Unlike realists, Nau argues, conservative internationalists accept the promotion of freedom as a legitimate goal of U.S. foreign policy. Unlike liberal internationalists, they believe that American power, rather than international institutions, offers the greatest hope for progress. They also believe in an aggressive combination of force and diplomacy to advance the American agenda worldwide, but they are less confident than either liberals or neoconservatives that a democratic utopia is just around the corner. This is a valuable way of thinking about U.S. foreign policy for a post-Bush, post-Obama future. It will be interesting to see if any 2016 Republican presidential candidates look to Nau’s ideas as a way to bridge the widening gaps within the GOP when it comes to foreign policy."
36,Reign of Error; Radical,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2013-12-15/reign-error-radical,Reign of Error; Radical,"Two recent books by leading figures in the fight for the future of American education illustrate the passions at play in one of the country’s most important debates. Ravitch has emerged as the most consistent and searching critic of the contemporary education-reform movement, which favors more testing, more accountability for teachers, and more charter schools. The movement enjoys the support of an influential coalition of entrepreneurs, politicians of both parties, and wealthy foundations. Against these formidable opponents, Ravitch scores some important points: test scores are somewhat arbitrary, “teaching to the test” is not how great schools are built, segregation and poverty contribute to poor school performance more than many reformers admit, both the Bush and the Obama administrations gave the Department of Education far more power than it can wield wisely or well, and proponents of charter schools and school-voucher programs do not always have the facts on their side. As for school choice, which reformers believe will improve the system by making schools compete for students (and the funding that comes with them), Ravitch argues that education is one of the areas in which free-market thinking and market metaphors fail. But Ravitch’s feisty defense of the pre-reform status quo will strike many readers as too undiscriminating. Can it really be true that in cities where governments have been hollowed out by decades of corruption and one-party rule, the public school systems don’t need much reform? Is it not true that many public school teachers become cynical and despairing after years spent working in dysfunctional systems?"

Imagine, however, the dilemmas that will arise once machines not only are able to kill at a distance but also can decide whom to kill, without any opportunity for human deliberation or, possibly, hesitation. In this thoughtful meditation on technology and ethics, Riza, a fighter pilot and colonel in the U.S. Air Force, worries that robotics make it easier to go to war. But the concern that mechanical slaughter is replacing the work of discerning warriors is hardly new, and Riza exaggerates the role that robotics will play in future combat. Nonetheless, he performs a valuable service by raising the challenging issues of impunity and accountability."

He argues that most future conflicts will occur in cities, thanks to the extraordinary growth in urban populations and the interconnectedness wrought by new technologies, which will create novel opportunities for crime and political violence. Kilcullen brings his narrative to life by using contemporary examples, including the recent revolts in Libya and Syria and the 2008 terrorist attacks in Mumbai. The density of contemporary cities makes it easier for gangsters and warlords to assert control and renders civilian populations highly vulnerable. Security forces can address such threats, but as Kilcullen notes, a lack of popular support can make intensive search-and-destroy measures counterproductive. Kilcullen’s book would have benefited from more historical perspective. States have long coped with the particular challenges of urban security. Modern Paris was designed, in part, to help the authorities maintain order, and in Warsaw during World War II, anti-Nazi Polish resisters learned that states or armies can suppress a popular urban uprising so long as they care little about preserving life or property."

In vivid terms, Churchill made the case for nuclear deterrence, reflecting on the “sublime irony” that the world had reached a point “where safety will be the sturdy child of terror, and survival the twin brother of annihilation.” In this terrific book, Farmelo tells the story of the United Kingdom’s nuclear program, which began with pioneering work in Cambridge before World War II and ultimately merged with the United States’ Manhattan Project. The book is built around a compelling portrait of Churchill that demonstrates the variability of his judgment. Farmelo also introduces readers to the remarkable collection of scientists who led the British endeavor and who helped shaped the country’s nuclear policy, including Frederick Lindemann, Churchill’s main scientific adviser, whom Farmelo portrays as an antidemocratic snob with flawed judgment. Farmelo demonstrates that although principles and evidence often shape the relationship between science and policy, personality and politics play just as large a role."

In this, they are no different from other political entities, except that their resources tend to be as meager as their ambitions are huge. Their organizational challenges are aggravated further by the need to remain covert."
41,East Asian Development: Foundations and Strategies,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2013-12-17/east-asian-development-foundations-and-strategies,East Asian Development: Foundations and Strategies,"During the past half century, the global economy’s most impressive growth engines have largely resided in East and Southeast Asia. To explain the extraordinary performance of these Asian economies, Perkins draws on academic research and on his own decades-long experience as an adviser to developing countries. It comes as no surprise that the explanations vary over time and from economy to economy. Also unsurprising is the good deal of attention that Perkins pays to China, the largest of the economies examined (India and the rest of South Asia are not included). Perkins predicts that China’s outsized economic growth will decline significantly in the years ahead, perhaps to an annual rate of five percent, which would still be high by world standards. He also helpfully places China in the context of other successful Asian countries, in which, Perkins argues, high growth has been aided by a strong emphasis on education. Asian countries’ development of their nonagricultural labor forces has also played an important role, as has their steady engagement with the global economy."
42,Freedom From National Debt,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/freedom-national-debt,Freedom From National Debt,"Newman, a former senior official at the U.S. Treasury Department, offers a primer on the vital role of U.S. Treasury securities in the global economy. In the process, he exposes as mere blather much of the what passes for sound discussion of U.S. public debt and the federal government’s debt ceiling, persuasively contradicting claims commonly made by deficit hawks. The U.S. government, whose securities are less risky than bank deposits, is not akin to an extremely large household, he argues, and its finances should not be evaluated as if it were. Near-term federal budget deficits are not a burden on future generations, as long as the borrowed funds are spent wisely and will result in more production. Foreign ownership of U.S. Treasuries does not pose much risk to the United States, and interest payments on U.S. public debt do not consume economic resources. This short book should be read by every journalist who covers economics and finance, every politician or policymaker who works on economic affairs, and anyone else concerned about the federal government’s role in the U.S. economy and the country’s financial system."

His analysis is kinder to China than other reviews of the crisis have been, and he places a good deal of blame for the disaster on financial deregulation in Europe and the United States. Lin argues that to end today’s global economic stagnation and to reduce the risk of future financial crises, banks and households in Europe and in the United States must repair their balance sheets and Western governments must regain the flexibility they need to pursue sound fiscal policies. Economies around the world require long-term investments in infrastructure and education, and Lin urges international financial institutions to lend more for those purposes, financing such loans by borrowing in financial markets or directly from countries with excess foreign exchange reserves. Doing so would boost economic recovery and create jobs in rich countries while furthering development in poor ones. Lin also presents a rather sketchy proposal for reforming the international monetary system by introducing a new internationally agreed-on reserve asset and establishing relatively stable exchange rates."
44,The Price of Rights: Regulating International Labor Migration,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2013-12-17/price-rights-regulating-international-labor-migration,The Price of Rights: Regulating International Labor Migration,"Migration across national boundaries has increased greatly in the last decade and has become a contentious political issue in many receiving countries. To what extent should countries encourage immigration? What rights should be conferred on immigrants, especially temporary ones? Ruhs emphasizes the uncomfortable tradeoffs built into every answer to those questions. The UN Human Rights Council and the International Labor Organization, along with many civil rights groups and labor unions, take the position that foreign-born workers should not be discriminated against in their new places of employment. Others, including the governments of developing countries and some economists, believe that more immigration, particularly from poor countries to rich ones, would improve the lots of the receiving countries and the immigrants alike. Ruhs points to the substantial tension that exists between those two positions: stronger rights will lead receiving countries to accept fewer immigrants, especially temporary ones. He urges receiving countries to prioritize the rights of immigrants, identifying which rights are inalienable and which ones should be considered more malleable given the need to stimulate more immigration."
45,A Case for Climate Engineering,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2013-12-17/case-climate-engineering,A Case for Climate Engineering,"Many uncertainties surround the future effects of climate change. Keith, a physicist, argues that humankind would be wise to do some contingency planning, in case those effects prove to be more powerful than now predicted or come faster than expected. The earth has experienced many different climates, and human beings are highly adaptable. But we adapt more easily to slow processes than to rapid ones, so we should learn how to slow down global warming through climate engineering -- just in case we need to. Keith focuses on techniques to reduce the amount of sunlight that reaches the earth’s surface by reflecting some of it back into space, such as placing aerosols into the stratosphere. Keith does not recommend that anyone try this yet, nor does he suggest that it would be a good substitute for reducing emissions of greenhouse gases. But he wants scientists to learn how to do it effectively and efficiently while minimizing any unwanted side effects.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

Drawing on evidence from such missions in Germany after World War II and more recent attempts in Nicaragua, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Afghanistan, and elsewhere, Miller argues there is no master strategy that will work in all instances. In successful cases, such as the Allied occupation of Germany and the UN’s postconflict reconstruction operations in Mozambique and Namibia, the key was correctly matching the strategy to the problem. The most important choices that would-be nation builders must make are whether to impose direct rule over a failed state and whether to assume full responsibility for its security. Miller argues that the ongoing failure in Afghanistan is a result of NATO and the United States’ adopting the wrong strategy for rebuilding Afghan state security forces. Despite his firsthand experience of the struggle in Afghanistan, Miller delivers a surprisingly upbeat assessment of armed state building. His book displays an admirable clarity in its evidence and analysis, although it is worth wondering whether powerful Western states can reliably behave as carefully as Miller advises."
47,Global Intellectual History,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2013-12-17/global-intellectual-history,Global Intellectual History,"Scholars have traditionally studied ideas and intellectual history within national, regional, or civilizational contexts. But as part of a broader “global history” movement, historians have begun to interpret the rise and spread of ideas as a global phenomenon. This useful collection includes scholars who study the paths of ideas such as Confucianism, republicanism, and market economics by examining what happened when intellectuals in one country grappled with the ideas of another. Others focus on the great forces that push and pull ideas around the globe, such as commerce and conquest. One of the more interesting chapters reveals that the particular European ideas about civilization and society that made their way to Japan during the late nineteenth century just happened to be ones that the Japanese authorities could use to legitimize their reorganization of the state. Lurking in the background of the book is a charged question: Is global intellectual history another way for the strong to dominate the weak, or is it a way for diverse peoples and societies to search together for knowledge?"

Kaplan chronicles the Truman administration’s navigation of the tricky politics of ratifying the treaty and bringing the alliance to life. The book’s most interesting element is the story it tells about how American proponents of NATO were able to cast the treaty less as a military alliance and more as a tool of U.S. postwar internationalism, creating a partnership that would bolster European stability and allay British and French fears of a resurgent Germany. The alliance emerged not in a single moment of creation but through a long and tedious process of negotiations marked as much by improvisation as by design. Nonetheless, as Kaplan argues, the two sides ultimately discovered the terms of a grand bargain: the United States would commit itself to helping rebuild and protect Europe, and the Europeans would overcome their differences and forge a new Atlantic system."

Liberal internationalists and “just war” theorists see themselves as trying to prevent and circumscribe acts of violence and war. But Rengger argues that, ironically, these liberal political traditions are instead creating new legal and moral justifications for the use of force around the world. Liberal ideas of law and justice have led the Western powers to pursue new and more expansive collective ends. Although many liberals have opposed specific interventions, such as the Iraq war, Rengger sees their embrace of such ideas as “the responsibility to protect” as a sign that long-standing restraints on the use of force will soon begin to disappear. Rengger wants the world to think of international law and justice not as tools for a progressive agenda but as frameworks that allow people to pursue their own ends. But the question remains: Without ambitious efforts to solve collective global problems, how viable is individual freedom?"

In Barber’s view, nation-states have shown that they are simply not up to the task of global governance. Cities, on the other hand, have demonstrated remarkable political vitality. Their politics tend to be pragmatic and oriented toward problem solving: trash needs to be picked up; streets must be plowed. Barber’s most interesting thesis is that cities, which now house more than half of humanity, are more internationalist and inclined toward bottom-up solutions than states. Barber’s proposal is to make cities the “building blocks” of a form of global governance enshrined in a “parliament of mayors.” The book is organized around short portraits of activist mayors, such as New York City’s Michael Bloomberg, London’s Boris Johnson, Moscow’s Yuri Luzhkov, and Delhi’s Sheila Dikshit. The book is convincing in its claim, echoed in the words of Rio de Janeiro’s mayor, Eduardo Paes, that the leaders of cities have “the political position to really change people’s lives.” Less convincing is the idea that cities can carry the burden of global problem solving, where the challenges include stabilizing financial markets, promoting economic growth and equality, and protecting rights and freedoms."

And for most of its history, it was. But in recent decades, the former Danish colony has begun to attract outsized attention from abroad. After its banks were fully privatized in 2003, foreign money poured into the financial sector, which grew to almost ten times the size of national GDP before bursting in a matter of days in October 2008. More lasting may be Iceland’s potential as a player in its Arctic backyard, where climate change is opening up new shipping routes and resource opportunities. As Iceland’s first political science professor, its finance minister from 1988 to 1991, and its president since 1996, Ólafur Ragnar Grímsson has studied and survived these shifts of fortune. He spoke with Foreign Affairs senior editor Stuart Reid outside Reykjavik in October."

A one-term state governor, Peña Nieto was relatively untested. His election also represented a return to power for Mexico’s Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which had run the country for 70 years before being ousted in 2000 in the country’s first freely contested elections. Many feared that Peña Nieto’s ascendance would mean a resumption of the bad old days of crony capitalism, economic stagnation, and tacit cooperation with the country’s brutal drug cartels. Instead, the new president immediately set about enacting far-reaching economic reforms, taking on fiscal policy, unions, oligarchs, and a cosseted energy sector in rapid succession. He even got a fat tax on junk food passed last October. But as Peña Nieto’s first year in office has drawn to a close, results from the new approach have yet to materialize. Mexico’s economy has slumped, crime remains a serious threat, and polls show voter confidence in the president sagging. In mid-November, Peña Nieto met with Foreign Affairs managing editor Jonathan Tepperman at Los Pinos, Mexico’s presidential residence, to discuss his term to date and his plans for the future."

57,From Shah to Supreme Leader,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/review-essay/shah-supreme-leader,From Shah to Supreme Leader,"There is something irresistible about the story of Iran’s last shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. The pampered, foreign-educated son of a dour autocrat, Mohammad Reza ascended to the Peacock Throne in 1941, at age 21. He was weak and malleable, surrounded by sycophants and schemers, beholden to foreign powers that treated him with contempt. Nearly unseated by his popular prime minister, Mohammad Mosaddeq, in 1953, the shah retained his throne with American and clerical connivance. That crucible hardened him into something both brittle and shrewd. He fancied himself a nationalist beloved by his people, but in truth he scarcely knew them; he grew Iran’s economy and its military, broke up feudal landholdings, and crushed dissent with his notorious intelligence service, known as SAVAK and adept in torture. “The boy,” as he was known in his father’s court, became a man: melancholic, grandiose, lonely, standing athwart titanic forces he could barely recognize let alone contain. No one was ever so blind-sided by the history he had made."

59,NAFTA's Mixed Record,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/canada/2013-12-06/naftas-mixed-record,NAFTA’s Mixed Record,"When the North American Free Trade Agreement was proposed, it set off a vigorous debate across the continent about its benefits and drawbacks. Today, 20 years after it came into effect, perhaps the only thing everyone can agree on is that all sides greatly exaggerated: NAFTA brought neither the huge gains its proponents promised nor the dramatic losses its adversaries warned of. Everything else is debatable. Mexico, in particular, is a very different place today -- a multiparty democracy with a broad middle class and a competitive export economy -- and its people are far better off than ever before, but finding the source of the vast changes that have swept the country is a challenging task. It would be overly simplistic to credit NAFTA for Mexico’s many transformations, just as it would be to blame NAFTA for Mexico’s many failings."
60,NAFTA's Unfinished Business,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/canada/2013-12-06/naftas-unfinished-business,NAFTA’s Unfinished Business,"In 1992, when Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney sat down with Mexican President Carlos Salinas and U.S. President George H. W. Bush to sign the North American Free Trade Agreement, free trade was still a matter of fierce national debate in Canadian politics. NAFTA was meant to build on the U.S.-Canadian free-trade agreement that Mulroney had signed at the beginning of 1988, and his support for that deal had cost his party 34 parliamentary seats in federal elections later that year, which had focused almost exclusively on the issue."
61,NAFTA's Economic Upsides,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/canada/2013-12-06/naftas-economic-upsides,NAFTA’s Economic Upsides,"In the 20 years since it entered into force, the North American Free Trade Agreement has been both lauded and attacked in the United States. But to properly assess NAFTA’s record, it is important to first be clear about what the agreement has actually done. Economically speaking, the answer is a lot. By uniting the economies of Canada, Mexico, and the United States, NAFTA created what is today a $19 trillion regional market with some 470 million consumers. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce figures that some six million U.S. jobs depend on trade with Mexico and another eight million on trade with Canada. NAFTA was the first comprehensive free-trade agreement to join developed and developing nations, and it achieved broader and deeper market openings than any trade agreement had before."
62,The Rise and Fall of the Failed-State Paradigm,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/world/rise-and-fall-failed-state-paradigm,The Rise and Fall of the Failed-State Paradigm,"For a decade and a half, from the mid-1990s through about 2010, the dominant national security narrative in the United States stressed the dangers posed by weak or failing states. These were seen to breed terrorism, regional chaos, crime, disease, and environmental catastrophe. To deal with such problems at their roots, the argument ran, the United States had to reach out and help stabilize the countries in question, engaging in state building on a neo-imperial scale. And reach out the United States did -- most obviously during the protracted campaigns in Afghanistan and Iraq."
63,Running the Pentagon Right,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2013-12-06/running-pentagon-right,Running the Pentagon Right,"War inevitably presents unexpected challenges. From Germany’s use of mustard gas during World War I to North Vietnam’s surprisingly effective use of its air defense system during the Vietnam War, the United States has always faced unanticipated threats in combat that have required agile responses. U.S. troops on the ground continually adjust to changing enemy tactics with the capabilities they have at hand. Yet the part of the Defense Department that trains and equips those troops has rarely been as flexible."
64,America's Social Democratic Future,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2013-12-06/americas-social-democratic-future,America’s Social Democratic Future,"Since March 2010, when U.S. President Barack Obama signed the Affordable Care Act into law, the ACA has been at the center of American politics. Tea Party activists and their allies in the Republican Party have tried to stymie the law at nearly every turn. The Republican-controlled House of Representatives has voted more than 40 times in favor of repealing or defunding it, and last October the House allowed a partial shutdown of the federal government in an attempt to block or delay the law. The controversy surrounding the ACA shows no sign of ending anytime soon."
65,How China Is Ruled,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2013-12-06/how-china-ruled,How China Is Ruled,"China had three revolutions in the twentieth century. The first was the 1911 collapse of the Qing dynasty, and with it, the country’s traditional system of governance. After a protracted period of strife came the second revolution, in 1949, when Mao Zedong and his Communist Party won the Chinese Civil War and inaugurated the People’s Republic of China; Mao’s violent and erratic exercise of power ended only with his death, in 1976."
66,The Unruled World,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/world/unruled-world,The Unruled World,"While campaigning for president in 2008, Barack Obama pledged to renovate the dilapidated multilateral edifice the United States had erected after World War II. He lionized the generation of Franklin Roosevelt, Harry Truman, and George Marshall for creating the United Nations, the Bretton Woods institutions, and NATO. Their genius, he said, was to recognize that “instead of constraining our power, these institutions magnified it.” But the aging pillars of the postwar order were creaking and crumbling, Obama suggested, and so “to keep pace with the fast-moving threats we face,” the world needed a new era of global institution building."
67,The Ever-Emerging Markets,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/world/ever-emerging-markets,The Ever-Emerging Markets,"In the middle of the last decade, the average growth rate in emerging markets hit over seven percent a year for the first time ever, and forecasters raced to hype the implications. China would soon surpass the United States as an economic power, they said, and India, with its vast population, or Vietnam, with its own spin on authoritarian capitalism, would be the next China. Searching for the political fallout, pundits predicted that Beijing would soon lead the new and rising bloc of the BRICs -- Brazil, Russia, India, and China -- to ultimate supremacy over the fading powers of the West. Suddenly, the race to coin the next hot acronym was on, and CIVETS (Colombia, Indonesia, Vietnam, Egypt, Turkey, and South Africa) emerged from the MIST (Mexico, Indonesia, South Korea, and Turkey)."
68,Six Markets to Watch: The Mekong Region,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2013-12-06/six-markets-watch-mekong-region,Six Markets to Watch: The Mekong Region,"Mainland Southeast Asia -- long fought over and controlled by outside powers, from the colonial era through the Cold War -- is finally fending for itself, and then some. Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam, which were once French Indochina, have grown at an impressive clip in recent years, with the last two taking their cues from China to blend communism and capitalism. Myanmar (also called Burma), once part of British India, is rapidly opening up to trade and foreign investment after decades of insular military dictatorship. And Thailand, the only Southeast Asian country never to have been taken over by a European colonial power, has proved resilient despite its prolonged political discord, humming along as the region’s manufacturing, tourism, and service-sector hub."
69,Six Markets to Watch: Indonesia and the Philippines,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/indonesia/2013-12-06/six-markets-watch-indonesia-and-philippines,Six Markets to Watch: Indonesia and the Philippines,"As recently as 2008, the economies of Southeast Asia received roughly less than half as much foreign direct investment as China did. Four years later, in 2012, they pulled to within spitting distance ($111 billion versus $121 billion). This surge in international interest reflects the region’s attractive demographics and, even more so, its impressive recent economic performance."
70,Six Markets to Watch: Turkey,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/turkey/2013-12-06/six-markets-watch-turkey,Six Markets to Watch: Turkey,"For much of last year, Turkey’s economy seemed almost on top of the world. In May, as huge construction projects moved ahead, Ankara paid off its remaining debt to the International Monetary Fund, ending what seemed to many Turks a long history of humiliation. The country received an encouraging investment-grade rating, and foreign funds poured in like never before."
71,Six Markets to Watch: Poland,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/poland/2013-12-06/six-markets-watch-poland,Six Markets to Watch: Poland,"Anyone who knows Polish history cannot help but marvel at the country’s emergence from the ashes of its traumatic past. Over the last 25 years, Poland, after centuries of war and subjugation, has enjoyed peace, a stable and booming economy, and integration with the rest of Europe."
72,Six Markets to Watch: South Korea,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/south-korea/2013-12-06/six-markets-watch-south-korea,Six Markets to Watch: South Korea,"South Korea’s development over the last half century has been nothing short of spectacular. Fifty years ago, the country was poorer than Bolivia and Mozambique; today, it is richer than New Zealand and Spain, with a per capita income of almost $23,000. For 50 years, South Korea’s economy has grown by an average of seven percent annually, contracting in only two of those years. In 1996, South Korea joined the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the club of rich industrialized countries, and in 2010, it became the first Asian country and the first non-G-7 member to host a G-20 summit."
73,Six Markets to Watch: Mexico,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/mexico/2013-12-06/six-markets-watch-mexico,Six Markets to Watch: Mexico,"Just over a year ago, as President Enrique Peña Nieto started his administration, the domestic and international press were touting “Mexico’s moment” and the rise of “the Aztec tiger.” Now, the naysayers have returned. Their pessimism stems in part from disappointing economic results: Mexico’s GDP growth has fallen, from nearly four percent in 2012 to around an estimated one percent in 2013. The negativity also reflects the impatience of pundits and markets, as the economic dividends from Peña Nieto’s ambitious economic reform agenda have yet to appear."

0,Aid and Authoritarianism in Africa: Development Without Democracy,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2016-08-11/aid-and-authoritarianism-africa-development-without-democracy,Aid and Authoritarianism in Africa: Development Without Democracy,"In the early 1990s, a wave of democracy swept the African continent, leading many observers to proclaim enthusiastically that the region was experiencing its “second independence.” Many expected that with the end of the Cold War, foreign powers would no longer support authoritarian regimes. Others saw promise in the “democratic conditionality” policies through which international organizations and Western donors tied their aid to political reform. These hopes went largely unrealized; as Hagmann and Reyntjens observe in this well-organized, fascinating collection, foreign aid to authoritarian countries actually increased from 1990 to 2013. Hagmann and Reyntjens open the book by introducing the existing debate; Nicolas van de Walle concludes it by observing the emergence of “democracy fatigue” in Africa. Rita Abrahamsen argues that the definition of democracy has changed in development-aid circles, with security and stability now prioritized over liberty. The remaining chapters consist of six case studies of authoritarian countries that receive high levels of aid (Angola, Cameroon, Ethiopia, Mozambique, Rwanda, and Uganda). Although it does not provide final answers, this volume offers comprehensive explanations of donors’ motives in supporting such regimes—and details the consequences of that support."
1,The Gun in Central Africa: A History of Technology and Politics,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2016-08-11/gun-central-africa-history-technology-and-politics,The Gun in Central Africa: A History of Technology and Politics,"Macola’s history of the mid-nineteenth-century introduction of firearms into Malawi, Zambia, and what is today the southern section of the Democratic Republic of the Congo provides a fascinating perspective on the evolution of societies, trade, ethnic rivalries, and war in the decades leading up to the European scramble for the continent. Macola documents how hundreds of thousands of firearms made their way into the region and further unsettled places that had already been destabilized by the slave trade. Some ethnic groups enthusiastically adopted firearms and quickly integrated them into their war-fighting and state-building strategies. Others did not, viewing the new weapons as a threat to prevailing notions of masculinity and honor and thus putting themselves at a military disadvantage. Macola’s broader purpose is to place the study of precolonial Africa back on the scholarly agenda and show how it remains relevant today. The conclusion of his fine book suggests a link between the adoption of firearms in central Africa a century and a half ago and the motivations and actions of the young men in today’s eastern Congo who join militias and spread insecurity and violence."
2,Africa's Long Road Since Independence: The Many Histories of a Continent,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2016-08-11/africas-long-road-independence-many-histories-continent,Africa’s Long Road Since Independence: The Many Histories of a Continent,"This introductory overview of the region’s history by a veteran BBC journalist focuses on broad political and economic trends and eschews simple takeaways. The book unfolds mostly in chronological order, from the disappointments of the immediate postindependence era in the 1960s, to the breakdown of many ruling regimes amid the military coups and civil wars of the 1970s, to the economic crises of the 1980s and 1990s, and finally to the tentative recovery of the last two decades. Somerville’s most trenchant analysis concerns civil conflicts such as the Rwandan genocide and the liberation struggles in southern Africa. He emphasizes what he considers to be powerful structural constraints on the region: the historical weight of the slave trade and colonialism and Africa’s weak position in the global economy. Ironically, however, his book illustrates the enduring influence of the colonial era: its primary subject is Anglophone Africa, and the material on Francophone and Lusophone Africa is rather perfunctory, reflecting the fact that media and governments in colonial powers continue to see the continent through the lens of the places their countries used to control."
3,South Africa: Settler Colonialism and the Failures of Liberal Democracy; South Africa's Insurgent Citizens: On Dissent and the Possibility of Politics,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2016-08-11/south-africa-settler-colonialism-and-failures-liberal-democracy,South Africa: Settler Colonialism and the Failures of Liberal Democracy; South Africa’s Insurgent Citizens: On Dissent and the Possibility of Politics,"In these books, two South African academics examine their country’s increasingly contentious politics. The optimism inspired by the release of Nelson Mandela from prison a quarter of a century ago and the end of apartheid soon after has been replaced by a deep sense of foreboding. Increasing corruption, persistently high levels of violent crime, and an unsteady economy have lent South Africa the distinction of being both the slowest-growing country in sub-Saharan Africa that is not engaged in a civil war and the country with the region’s highest level of income inequality."
4,City of Thorns: Nine Lives in the World's Largest Refugee Camp,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2016-08-11/city-thorns-nine-lives-worlds-largest-refugee-camp,City of Thorns: Nine Lives in the World’s Largest Refugee Camp,"With well over 300,000 inhabitants, the five camps that make up the UN base in Dadaab, in eastern Kenya, constitute the biggest refugee complex in the world. Opened in 1992, as civil war in Somalia drove a mass exodus of refugees, the camp has expanded to take in more people with each new crisis in that country. Rawlence’s stunning, disturbing portrait of Dadaab begins in 2011, when the rise of the Islamist militia al Shabab ignited yet another cycle of violence in and around Mogadishu, the Somali capital. The book follows the daily lives of nine individuals in various settlements in Dadaab as they struggle to survive and retain their humanity in an uncertain, violent environment without adequate food or social services. Rawlence focuses on the refugees, but his book is also a damning portrait of the camp as a woeful failure on the part the Kenyan government and the international community. As one of the book’s protagonists rueully concedes, coming to Dadaab from Somalia was like trading one version of hell for another."
5,China's Quest: The History of the Foreign Relations of the People's Republic of China,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2016-08-11/chinas-quest-history-foreign-relations-peoples-republic-china,China’s Quest: The History of the Foreign Relations of the People’s Republic of China,"China’s Quest lives up to the definitive comprehensiveness suggested by its subtitle. This superb, lengthy volume knits together thick descriptions of events in China from 1949 until today into a clear, compelling narrative. In Garver’s telling, all of China’s modern leaders—from Mao Zedong, who was guided by his leftist vision, to Deng Xiaoping, who prioritized market-responsive economic modernization, to Xi Jinping, the current president, who has played great-power politics and built a strongman persona—have steadfastly pursued what they believed to be China’s interests. Each leader saw his country as facing a deep domestic crisis of legitimacy, and their respective foreign policies were primarily attempts to shore up that weakness. But their efforts to legitimize the regime all had fatal flaws, which compelled their successors—or will compel them, in Xi’s case—to reinvent the stories that the party told the people. With each reinvention, Beijing’s external policies changed to fit the new line. But the Communist Party has yet to come up with a convincing rationale for one-party rule that can simultaneously make the Chinese people, China’s neighbors, and the world beyond feel comfortable with China’s rise and also aid domestic stability and material progress. The struggle goes on. As Garver concludes: “There may be further detours.”"
6,Writers of the Winter Republic: Literature and Resistance in Park Chung Hee's Korea,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2016-08-11/writers-winter-republic-literature-and-resistance-park-chung-hees,Writers of the Winter Republic: Literature and Resistance in Park Chung Hee’s Korea,"“The Winter Republic” was a label given by a dissident poet to the dictatorial rule of the South Korean leader Park Chung-hee, who led the country from 1962 until 1979; the regime imprisoned and tortured the poet for his impudence. This beautifully written book analyzes the work of four other authors whose fiction and poetry exposed political oppression and social injustice during that time. Perhaps the best known is Kim Chi-ha, whose scatological poem “Five Bandits” alludes to the corruption of high figures in government. The Park regime confirmed its bad conscience by jailing Kim for most of its time in power. The other three writers were equally quirky, brave, and talented. Ryu’s close readings bring these fascinating works alive even for those who don’t read Korean. Park’s successor, Chun Doo-hwan, would later say that Park had “lost his fight against books.”"
7,India at the Global High Table: The Quest for Regional Primacy and Strategic Autonomy,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2016-08-11/india-global-high-table-quest-regional-primacy-and-strategic,India at the Global High Table: The Quest for Regional Primacy and Strategic Autonomy,"The Schaffers draw on their long experience in the U.S. diplomatic corps to provide insight into the history of India’s goals and negotiating styles. Strategic realities impose certain imperatives on India, including the need to pursue economic development, confront Pakistani enmity, balance the rising power of China, and constrain the foreign policy options of smaller neighbors. But the manner in which India conducts its diplomacy is shaped by its self-image as home to a superior civilization, its resentment of colonialism, its suspicion of U.S. intentions, its humiliation over its defeat in the 1962 border war with China, and the elitist culture of its foreign service. These factors help explain its aversion to alliances and multilateral commitments and its reluctance to settle issues pragmatically, which have led some people to characterize Indian diplomacy as “preachy” and “pricklish,” as the Schaffers relate. Despite warming relations between India and the United States, the authors doubt that New Delhi will cooperate as much as Washington would like."
8,Building China: Informal Work and the New Precariat,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2016-08-11/building-china-informal-work-and-new-precariat,Building China: Informal Work and the New Precariat,"China’s vast new cities have been built by millions of migrant construction workers from the countryside, who labor without contracts, fringe benefits, or injury compensation. In this closely observed and empathetic account, Swider describes three types of labor arrangements. Some migrants sign up for a year at a time with trade-specialized teams that work for big contractors, moving among construction sites and never making contact with the urban society around them. Others do piecework in smaller, mixed-trade groups put together by relatives or people from their home provinces. They may bring their families to live in migrant ghettos in the cities, but under China’s hukou (household registration) system, they never acquire legal status as urban residents. Under a third type of arrangement, migrants pick up menial day jobs at “black labor markets,” risking physical abuse and taking their chances on getting paid. All these jobs are temporary. But in the construction field, the institution of temporary labor appears to be permanent. The workers are too fragmented and vulnerable to challenge the system."
9,The Rohingyas: Inside Myanmar's Hidden Genocide,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2016-08-11/rohingyas-inside-myanmars-hidden-genocide,The Rohingyas: Inside Myanmar’s Hidden Genocide,"Myanmar (also known as Burma) recognizes 135 ethnic minorities and treats many of them badly. But the 1.3 million Rohingyas are treated worst of all: they are denied official minority status and the citizenship rights that go with it. In the last few years, violent mobs have forced them into camps where they cannot work, go to school, vote, access health care, or get passports. Many have fled, becoming stateless refugees; some work in virtual slavery on fishing boats elsewhere in Southeast Asia. Ibrahim effectively discredits the historical canard that serves as the pretext for this abuse: that the Rohingyas, as Muslims of South Asian stock, are illegal immigrants from Bangladesh who don’t belong in predominantly Buddhist Myanmar. He shows that their ancestors were already living in what is now Rakhine State long before the British conquest of the region in 1826. The real problem is the effort of successive governments to generate support by finding an internal enemy to demonize. During the recent democratic transition, the political party associated with the military courted a violent brand of Buddhist fundamentalism, while the pro-democracy camp, led by Aung San Suu Kyi, shied away from the issue as a political third rail. This analytic but passionate book makes a strong case that Myanmar stands “on the brink of genocide.”"
10,The Dictator's Dilemma: The Chinese Communist Party's Strategy for Survival; China's Future,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2016-08-11/dictators-dilemma-chinese-communist-partys-strategy-survival,The Dictator’s Dilemma: The Chinese Communist Party’s Strategy for Survival; China’s Future,"It would be hard to imagine two more divergent views of the Chinese regime than the ones presented in these books—which were written, as it happens, by colleagues at George Washington University. Based on urban surveys and focus groups, Dickson’s book finds strong levels of trust in and support for the Chinese government. Dickson teases out how these attitudes are affected by the regime’s nimble use of various tools: repression, propaganda, economic performance, controlled channels for complaints, limited toleration of civil society groups, and the co-optation of ambitious young people by the Communist Party. To be sure, the regime may be digging its own grave by promoting economic growth, since modernization tends to make citizens less deferential. But the process of attitudinal change is slow and counterbalanced by patriotic sentiments and a cultural commitment to order and harmony. Dickson doubts the regime will be forced to democratize anytime soon."
11,"The Syrian Jihad: Al-Qaeda, the Islamic State, and the Evolution of an Insurgency",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2016-08-11/syrian-jihad-al-qaeda-islamic-state-and-evolution-insurgency,"The Syrian Jihad: Al-Qaeda, the Islamic State, and the Evolution of an Insurgency","Through his work at the Brookings Doha Center, Lister has participated in so-called Track II diplomacy—unofficial contacts between influential nonstate actors—with leaders and rank-and-file members of jihadist factions in Iraq and Syria. Those experiences inform this book, which is the most thorough chronicle yet of jihadist activity in the region since 2011. According to Lister, the 2013 split between al Qaeda’s Syrian affiliate (Jabhat al-Nusra) and the Islamic State (also known as ISIS) was provoked by strategic differences, not doctrinal ones. Al Qaeda wants to embed itself in local disputes and create operational safe havens, whereas ISIS wants to hold territory and govern. Intelligence services in Syria, Turkey, the United States, and elsewhere have played footsie with various jihadist groups. The Assad regime in Syria dispatched jihadists to Iraq in 2006 only to watch them return home, to deadly effect, in 2011. Lister details these developments but reveals less about crucial issues such as how various jihadist groups recruit new members, what motivates recruits, how they are paid, and how many casualties jihadist infighting has produced. He also does not address scenarios in which foreign patrons might abandon their proxies in Syria or the question of whether Iran must be defanged before the Sunni world will grow out of its jihadist obsessions."

They reflect a sense of optimism that has since evaporated. During the intervening years, Egypt hasturned 180 degrees and regressed to autocracy, and Tunisia has struggled to consolidate democracy while maintaining stability and security in a dangerous neighborhood. The specialists included in this volume all assume that in both places, enough political will exists to establish independent judiciaries, rule-bound police forces, civilian-controlled militaries, and transparent, clean governments. But even in Tunisia, that is not the case. The contributors examine other countries that have clawed their way out of similar straitjackets (Chile, Indonesia, and Mexico) but do not explain what would change the incentive structures of today’s Middle Eastern autocrats such that they would sponsor reforms that would destabilize their own rule. Even in Tunisia, the deep state and former regime elements maintain the expertise and will needed to reinvent the old system. To challenge the forces of atavism, reformers in the Middle East require allies on the inside. That is Tunisia’s hope—but God help Egypt."
13,America's War for the Greater Middle East: A Military History,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2016-08-11/americas-war-greater-middle-east-military-history,America’s War for the Greater Middle East: A Military History,"Bacevich, a historian and retired U.S. Army officer, brings welcome expertise to what he sees as the militarization of U.S. policy in the Middle East, which he dates to President Jimmy Carter’s 1979 decision to defend the Persian Gulf region. Since then, by Bacevich’s reckoning, the United States has been embroiled in four wars in the Middle East (the Iran-Iraq War, the 1990–91 Gulf War, the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003, and the current military campaign against the self-proclaimed Islamic State, or ISIS), plus the military excursions in Bosnia, Kosovo, and Somalia, which Bacevich (somewhat implausibly) links to the Middle East. According to him, all these efforts have been hugely misconceived and badly executed. He is right that Washington’s foreign policy and national security establishments have much to be ashamed of, but he detracts significantly from his analysis by adopting a sneering tone—General Tommy Franks, who led the fight against the Afghan Taliban and the 2003 invasion of Iraq, was “a thin-skinned lout”; the use of airpower in Bosnia was “an exercise in military masturbation”—and by appointing himself as judge and jury and finding nearly everyone guilty. His verdicts would be more credible if he specified any alternatives to the policies and decisions he condemns. But for the most part, readers are left to puzzle out for themselves how the alleged miscreants in Washington might have done better."
14,The Terror Years: From al-Qaeda to the Islamic State,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2016-08-11/terror-years-al-qaeda-islamic-state,The Terror Years: From al-Qaeda to the Islamic State,"In ten essays based mostly on articles published in The New Yorker, Wright takes readers on a disquieting journey through the world of violent jihadism, spending time with its perpetrators, its theorists, its mavericks, its victims, and its enemies. He manages to be insightful without telling readers what to think. Even for those familiar with Saudi Arabia, Wright’s portrait of the spiritual home of contemporary jihadism will be as chilling as it is credible. His sketches of the hellhole called Gaza and his profile of filmmakers in autocratic Syria are tangential to the main theme but nonetheless compelling. Throughout, Wright demonstrates how the U.S. government has tripped over its own shoelaces in trying to counter the jihadist threat. Wright’s portraits do not add up to a big picture or an overarching argument, but that is just as well: had that been Wright’s aim, it would have been overreach. In an epilogue, he outlines six paths by which violent Islam is likely to collapse or burn itself out. All of them, alas, stretch far into the future."
15,The New Arab Wars: Uprisings and Anarchy in the Middle East,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2016-08-11/new-arab-wars-uprisings-and-anarchy-middle-east,The New Arab Wars: Uprisings and Anarchy in the Middle East,"Lynch, a prolific and keen observer of the Arab world, has written the leading title in what amounts to a second wave of analyses of the Arab revolts of 2010–11, focusing on what went wrong. In his view, the cautious policies of the Obama administration were not to blame. Rather, the problem was Washington’s traditional allies in the region: Egypt, Israel, Saudi Arabia, and the Gulf states. In particular, Lynch casts Qatar and the United Arab Emirates as mice that roared, arming proxies in conflicts that have reduced Libya, Syria, and Yemen to figurative and actual rubble. Although Lynch posits that domestic politics have tended to determine outcomes since the revolts, his analysis in fact places a great deal of importance on the interventions launched by these two tiny (but rich) countries. His case would be more persuasive if he offered additional details about the flow of financial support from these states to their proxies in Libya and Syria. Looking to the future, Lynch sees reasons for both optimism and pessimism. There will be more waves of Arab discontent, but the United States will put itself steadfastly on the wrong side of history by backing its autocratic allies."
16,The Hapsburg Empire: A New History,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2016-08-11/hapsburg-empire-new-history,The Hapsburg Empire: A New History,"Judson turns on its head the traditional understanding of the Habsburg empire as a decrepit anachronism doomed by the long-simmering nationalist urges of disparate ethnic groups. On the contrary, he argues, from the last half of the eighteenth century (when Empress Maria Theresa instituted crucial reforms) until the empire’s demise in World War I, the Habsburg dynasty successfully enlisted a vast array of territories and subjects in its enlightened “efforts to be a unified and unifying imperial state.” The monarchy’s legal reforms, institutional innovations, and cultural flexibility created a symbiotic relationship between citizens—even the peasantry—and the regime, not least because whatever their linguistic and religious differences, subjects were allowed to “appropriate” or “reinterpret” Vienna’s will in ways that served local interests. The empire’s ability to inspire a transcendent identity and tolerate diversity should be the dominant lens through which its history is viewed, Judson argues. His bracing account could provide an overarching alternative framework to guide the growing number of narrower, more detailed revisionist histories of the Habsburgs."
17,The Silk Roads: A New History of the World,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2016-08-11/silk-roads-new-history-world,The Silk Roads: A New History of the World,"This new entry into the exclusive circle of big, brassy histories of the world focuses on inner Asia, from the Aegean Sea to the Himalayas. Frankopan makes the arresting and ultimately compelling argument that the interactions among peoples in this core of civilization were far more central to global affairs than the developments that Western-oriented histories typically feature in order to draw a line from ancient Greece and Rome to the Renaissance, the Enlightenment, and the Industrial Revolution. He has a point. Christianity flourished earlier in the East than in the West. Before the ninth century, the north-south slave trade was dominated by Vikings who transited the rivers of contemporary Russia. And before the ascendance of Islam, Persian-based Zoroastrianism prevailed over Buddhism and Christianity in much of the Near East, the Caucasus, and Central Asia. Put simply, these regions generated an immense range of historic phenomena. Frankopan deems all that flows from them—whether religion, commerce, or politics—“silk roads,” because the trade in silk underpinned it all. One comes away from this book convinced that the multidimensional history of the silk roads deserves a central place in an understanding of the roots of the modern world."

Clover traces this belief, called “Eurasianism,” back to its roots among fractious White Russian intellectual émigrés in the 1920s all the way to the present, where its warped echo resounds in the nationalist themes lately brandished by allies of Russian President Vladimir Putin."
19,Lysenko's Ghost: Epigenetics and Russia,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2016-08-11/lysenkos-ghost-epigenetics-and-russia,Lysenko’s Ghost: Epigenetics and Russia,"Trofim Lysenko, a Stalin-era Soviet agronomist, became infamous as a symbol of flawed, politically driven science by embracing the notion that organisms can pass on traits developed during their lifetimes to their offspring—and by then ravaging the field of Russian agronomy by helping purge the country’s most prominent geneticists, who disagreed with him. More recently, however, scientists have discovered that organisms sometimes do pass on “environmentally induced” gene modifications. In this spare, graceful book, Graham, the most distinguished U.S. historian of Soviet science, weighs in on what epigenetics (as the new field is called) is doing to science, particularly in Russia. Graham incisively recounts the long controversy over the heritability of acquired characteristics, and the book shines by uniting a succinct summary of Lysenko’s ideas with a report on where the modern debate stands, including the depressing resurgence of the worst aspects of Lysenko’s thinking in contemporary Russia. Graham finishes, however, with portraits of Russian scientists fighting that trend and who would agree with him that, whatever the merits of epigenetics, Lysenko’s poor science should share no credit."

And what a story it is. Montefiore consulted an immense number of sources, many of them original, to do what he does best: capture the tumultuous, often grotesque politics that dominated the inner sanctum of power while vividly bringing to life the people who inhabited it. He is awed by (and awes the reader with) the nearly unbelievable mixture of traits that defined the Romanovs. Cruel, libidinous, and crude almost beyond description, they were also molders of empire and skillful power brokers, holding Russia together through war, revolution, and the chaos of the country’s often brutal transformations. Once drawn into the drama of court intrigue—the plotting, the power struggles, the eccentricities, the infidelities, the stomach-turning orgies of retribution, and the bizarre bacchanalias at which the early tsars entertained themselves—the reader will have trouble putting down this hefty volume."
21,Open for Business: Building the New Cuban Economy,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2016-08-11/open-business-building-new-cuban-economy,Open for Business: Building the New Cuban Economy,"The dramatic resumption of U.S.-Cuban relations has focused attention on the economic and political outlook of the Caribbean island. Although the long- standing U.S. embargo of Cuba remains in effect and can be lifted only by Congress, restrictions on U.S. companies doing business in Cuba are clearly easing. The political backlash in the United States has been notably muted; Cuba is less and less of an issue, even among Cuban Americans. The question, however, is whether, even after the rapprochement with Washington, Cuba is prepared to open up its economy and politics. Feinberg offers a scrupulously researched and judicious analysis of the economic changes that have unfolded since 2008, when Raúl Castro replaced his brother Fidel as president and initiated a reform process. Feinberg rightly touts Cuba’s expanding private sector, the growth of the middle class, and the country’s increased openness to foreign investment, but he also notes the persistent obstacles to sustainable growth in Cuba—among them the behind-the-scenes struggles between hard-liners and moderate reformers. Feinberg is clear-eyed but, in the end, fairly optimistic about Cuba’s prospects. He believes a “sunny soft landing” scenario will probably prevail, and his illuminating profiles of a dozen Cuban millennials provide some grounds for hope. But the slow pace of change so far is not a heartening sign."

Both authors demonstrate that in fact, when dealing with the United States, capable Latin American leaders have not only successfully defended their interests but also astutely intervened in U.S. domestic politics to alter the way that Washington defines and pursues its interests in the region. Having delved into Latin American archives and interviewed Latin American leaders and diplomats, Long narrates four revealing case studies to demonstrate how apparently weaker states can come out on top in their dealings with larger, seemingly more powerful states. Indeed, smallness can be a source of strength, as governments wrap themselves in the popular banners of sovereignty and justice and rally other states to their cause, which Long dubs “collective foreign policy power.” Smaller states may also be more single-minded in pursuit of their diplomatic goals, whereas a global power such as the United States may be distracted by myriad other matters. Long’s case studies also suggest that Latin American countries can gain more through persistent diplomacy and cooperative solutions than through aggressive confrontation or by pursuing a negative form of autonomy."

Costly law enforcement efforts to suppress the drug trade fail, he persuasively argues, when they ignore basic economic forces. Narconomics reminded me of my own frustrations when I served on the U.S. National Security Council during the Clinton administration. I asked the intelligence community for a report on the narcotics industry that relied on the tools of economic analysis, treating drug organizations primarily as economic actors. “Can’t do it,” a senior official in the intelligence community told me. “We anticipate that our political overseers won’t much like the results.” It seemed that the skittish Clinton White House was less interested in really understanding the problem than in tough-on-drugs stories that would counter Republican critics. Two decades later, Wainwright’s findings are instructive. When consumer demand for narcotics is strong, efforts to restrict supply are likely to fail. It’s more cost effective to get someone off drugs than to bulk up police forces. And countering global criminal networks requires international cooperation. Wainwright comments favorably on Colorado’s experiment with controlled marijuana decriminalization, New Zealand’s authorization of a limited number of lower-risk recreational narcotics, and job-training programs that the government of the Dominican Republic has offered for those convicted of drug trafficking."
24,Heart of Europe: A History of the Holy Roman Empire,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2016-08-15/heart-europe-history-holy-roman-empire,Heart of Europe: A History of the Holy Roman Empire,"Most educated readers know very little about the Holy Roman Empire beyond Voltaire’s quip that it was “neither holy, nor Roman, nor an empire.” For years, historians derided its institutions as archaic and ineffective. In this ambitious and challenging book, Wilson sets out to show that the empire was in fact quite successful. He points out that it survived for a millennium, from 800 to 1806, during which time it fostered a uniquely decentralized, consensus-based style of international decision-making. This system encouraged imperial subjects to adopt multiple identities: individuals could simultaneously be citizens of cities, principalities, and the empire. Imperial policies rested on compromises among all these groups, which could be slow and ineffective. Yet the system bolstered local rule and patronage networks, fostered a distinctive church hierarchy, oversaw legitimate courts, consistently collected taxes, and even produced institutional innovations, such as the first public postal service. Wilson concludes by reflecting that this multilevel system of governance, with its divided loyalties, might even serve as a model for today’s faltering EU."
25,Final Solution: The Fate of the Jews 1933–1949,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2016-08-10/final-solution-fate-jews-1933-1949,Final Solution: The Fate of the Jews 1933–1949,"Cesarani, who passed away last year, was a leading historian of Jewish life and a prominent public advocate for proper commemoration of the Holocaust. This massive work demonstrates that those two vocations often conflict with each other. Cesarani criticizes the tendency of people and groups with political agendas, as well as purveyors of popular culture and designers of classroom materials, to portray the Holocaust as a deliberately managed project that followed necessarily from Nazi ideology. He claims that this view is, in large part, simply inconsistent with current scholarly research. The Nazis, he argues, had no master plan to exterminate the Jews on an industrial scale. Hitler initially intended to send them to Mozambique or Siberia. The war, however, limited his options, and the genocidal Final Solution was the result. Nazi bureaucracy was chaotic, with competing imperatives, such as exploiting the Jews as laborers but also exterminating them. The result was administrative conflict and confusion, and the genocide was hardly conducted in a consistent manner. Although not all of Cesarani’s evidence supports this interpretation, his book is a useful and compelling reminder that reality is far more complex than popular memory."

This book is based on interviews with Muslim girls in a liberal, multicultural school in Denmark—a place where one would expect to find open-minded attitudes toward other cultures and ways of life. Yet the author claims that the school’s teachers, despite their good intentions, tend to have negative views of the cultures from which the students come and seek to inculcate into the students a narrow model of proper Danish behavior, especially when it comes to sex, marriage, religion, and external appearance. The students feel stereotyped and find much of their teachers’ advice unwelcome. The author makes no effort to show that her sample is representative and relies on the type of jargon that drags down so much academic writing. Still, this book is worth reading for the verbatim notes of her conversations with her subjects, which bring to life the difficulties and dilemmas of cultural assimilation in Europe."
27,Religion and the Struggle for European Union: Confessional Culture and the Limits of Integration,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2016-08-10/religion-and-struggle-european-union-confessional-culture-and,Religion and the Struggle for European Union: Confessional Culture and the Limits of Integration,"In the past several years, the rise of the radical right and the spread of Euroskepticism, and, more recently, the vote in favor of a British exit from the EU, have focused attention on the cultural and ideological sources of support for and opposition to European integration. This book focuses on religion, and in particular the split between Catholics and Protestants, which was perhaps the most important division at the time that integration began in the 1950s. Nelsen and Guth revive the notion, once widely held by historians, that Catholics naturally favor integration whereas Protestants naturally oppose it. There are many reasons why one might think this is so, but the authors emphasize how current political attitudes are rooted in the battles of the Reformation era. Ever since that period, Catholics have viewed Europe, favorably, as fostering a single universal culture that transcends nation-states, whereas Protestants have seen the nation-state as an essential bulwark against just that sort of universalism, which they tend to fear. The book’s historical and statistical analysis is more suggestive than conclusive, and it fails to demonstrate that any correlation between Catholicism and pro-European sentiments results from the cultural factors the authors highlight. Yet it is nonetheless a provocative and original analysis that might help launch further debate on the historical origins of today’s conflicts over the EU."
28,Devolution and the UK Economy,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2016-08-10/devolution-and-uk-economy,Devolution and the UK Economy,"In normal times, a book on local economics in the United Kingdom edited by two business professors would pass unnoticed. But these are not normal times, and the issue of whether British territorial subunits can prosper on their own has taken on vital importance. The volume sets forth some clear and convincing findings on the matter. One is that Scotland’s relative poverty means that independence from the United Kingdom would be economic suicide. No matter what they say, the leaders of the pro-independence Scottish National Party likely have little interest in changing the current arrangement, in which they rule Scotland with the help of massive economic aid from London. This is paradoxical, because Scots who voted for independence in 2014 were motivated primarily by a desire for greater economic equality and not by nationalism. As for Wales, political apathy and the lack of a regional party have put the region at an economic disadvantage compared to Scotland. In Northern Ireland, the quest for greater economic autonomy through relatively low tax rates has had only a marginal effect on corporate investment—but it has reduced tax revenues, which has required the region to seek even more subsidies from London. Some individual English cities have also sought greater autonomy, but with the exception of Manchester, they have met with little success. Although local economic policy remains obscure, it may have a greater effect on British citizens than the big political issues that make headlines."

When it comes to assessing the administration’s foreign policy track record, Chollet’s verdict is more measured. He gives high marks to both phases of Obama’s approach to Russia (the “reset” and “the bear roars back”) and lauds the Iran nuclear agreement. Other initiatives, including the outreach to Muslim publics, the 2011 Libyan intervention, and the so-called pivot to Asia, get mixed reviews. (There is one reader who is certain to enjoy The Long Game: Hillary Clinton, for whom Chollet has nothing but praise in her role as secretary of state.) Chollet’s approach is both provocative and intriguing: the fact that Obama’s strategy consists of a list of desirables rather than a hierarchy of goals is one of the main charges made by the president’s critics. But for Chollet, as for Obama, this apparent defect is actually a strength, and the current world disorder is less the result of flawed U.S. strategies than the birth pangs of a new and better order. Time will tell."

With $15 trillion in equity, residential real estate represents the most important asset for a majority of U.S. families. The federal, state, and local policies that provided the financial services and physical infrastructure for suburban living have done more to shape American life than any government initiative since the Homestead Act. Environmentalists blame suburbs for promoting a gas-guzzling, energy-wasting culture; antipoverty activists point to the ways that government housing policy, including zoning regulation, traps the poor in inner cities, where jobs are scarce, and creates new forms of racial and class segregation. Since the financial crisis of 2008, which was driven in part by a real estate bubble, fierce debates have raged over whether housing policy should continue to favor suburbanization and the owner-occupied single-family home."
31,His Final Battle: The Last Months of Franklin Roosevelt,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2016-08-10/his-final-battle-last-months-franklin-roosevelt,His Final Battle: The Last Months of Franklin Roosevelt,"Among the many paradoxes of Franklin Roosevelt’s extraordinary career was the degree to which the most famous man in the United States managed to keep the truth about his failing health so effectively shrouded for so many years. Lelyveld, a winner of the Pulitzer Prize, succeeds to a remarkable degree in finding out what Roosevelt and his doctors knew about his deteriorating condition and how Roosevelt’s leadership was affected by his gradual decline, which was brought on by arterial disease and congestive heart failure. This is a difficult task, since most of Roosevelt’s medical records were destroyed long ago. His Final Battle is a gripping book that will substantially deepen readers’ understanding of a critical time in U.S. history. One scene in particular shows Roosevelt at his greatest. Weak and sick, the president visited a hospital for wounded soldiers and had himself wheeled slowly through all the wards for amputees, making sure the young men would see his own withered legs: after a bout of polio earlier in life, Roosevelt had been paralyzed from the waist down. By today’s standards, the secrecy that kept all knowledge of Roosevelt’s health away from the public would be deemed unacceptable. It is not, however, clear that Americans are better led now than they were in 1944."

The historical memories that bind people into political and cultural communities are, Rieff demonstrates, often inaccurate—less a set of lessons learned from the past than a distillation of a culture’s biases and illusions. And they can have a sinister impact on contemporary politics; Rieff looks at how in the United States, the glamorous myth of the “Lost Cause” of the Confederacy has served to promote racial polarization and hate since the Reconstruction era. He argues that forgetting even historical crimes on the scale of the Holocaust is ultimately both inevitable and beneficial. It is a shocking idea, and readers may wonder whether the process of forgetting will not be shaped by the same forces of pride and self-interest that distort the process of remembering. Nevertheless, in an age in which the memory of ancient grievances functions too frequently as a pretext for new crimes, Rieff is correct to observe that oblivion has some appeal."

Diplomats agree in principle but worry in practice. What if the pursuit of justice disrupts a valuable spy network, or produces administrative chaos as key government personnel are purged, or leads to political upheaval if one social group considers itself to be unduly targeted? That tension is at the heart of this fine and troubling book, which describes the efforts to track down individuals responsible for terrible crimes who have been hidden by sympathetic regimes or protected by those who fear that raking over the past will prove destabilizing to the present. The book covers the Nazi hunters, the international tribunals set up in response to crimes against humanity committed in Rwanda and during the Bosnian war, and the establishment of the International Criminal Court and the cases it has sought to address, almost all of which have involved crimes committed by African leaders. The authors also argue that in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, the United States began to use unlawful methods to capture and detain those it suspected of having ties to terrorism and so shifted from being “a vocal proponent of the international rule of law to a vocal proponent of American exceptionalism.”"
34,Losing Afghanistan: An Obituary for the Intervention,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2016-08-10/losing-afghanistan-obituary-intervention,Losing Afghanistan: An Obituary for the Intervention,"The title of this book suggests yet another polemic on the Western failure to appreciate just how difficult it would be to defeat the Afghan Taliban. Yet Coburn writes more in sorrow than in anger, focusing less on the military side of the NATO intervention in Afghanistan than on the developmental side. As an anthropologist working in Kabul during and after the “surge” of U.S. forces that began in 2009, he tried to figure out why efforts to improve the lives of ordinary Afghans fell far short. His book reveals an intervention that developed its own culture and ways of doing business, neither of which was well suited to the task. One unfamiliar but alarming problem he identifies is the role played by professional grant writers, who were employed by large nongovernmental organizations and contractors because they knew the precise terminology to use when seeking funds from the NATO bureaucracy, which allowed their clients to sweep up money, often at the expense of smaller and more modest groups that might have done more good."
35,Pumpkinflowers: A Soldier’s Story,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2016-08-10/pumpkinflowers-soldiers-story,Pumpkinflowers: A Soldier’s Story,"There was a time when military memoirs focused on climactic battles of great historic importance. But like other contemporary additions to the genre, Friedman’s describes a war without any real battles—a conflict in which the weaker side used ambushes and booby traps to demonstrate to the notionally stronger party that its position was untenable. In 1998, Friedman was deployed to the Pumpkin, an Israeli military outpost in southern Lebanon. (“Flowers” refers to a code word for casualties.) The outpost’s value had by that time been called into question, notably after a collision between two Israeli helicopters that took 73 lives. Helicopters had become necessary because of the vulnerability of Israeli vehicle convoys to improvised explosive devices laid by the militant group Hezbollah. After the Israelis withdrew from Lebanon in 2000, Friedman used his Canadian passport to return to the area as a civilian, meeting people who were friendly but also encountering a good deal of anti-Semitism. Friedman is a gifted writer, able to capture the tedium and anxiety of life at the Pumpkin with a spare, restrained, laconic style that keeps the reader engaged even when Friedman narrates incidents that lack drama. The result is a thoughtful meditation on both the nature of modern war and a changing Israeli society."

Jones turns this around by instead asking what it takes for an insurgency to succeed. This allows him to look at recent conflicts, including those in Kosovo and Libya, in which Western powers supported insurgents. He combines quantitative data with careful observations to craft a thoughtful, original, and comprehensive analysis of how insurgencies start; the strategies, tactics, and organizational approaches they adopt; and their need for foreign support. Not surprisingly, the most successful insurgents tend to be those who can challenge the state on its own terms by using conventional force with support from an external power. Guerrilla warfare is a less promising option, since it relies on exhausting one’s enemies rather than defeating them. One slightly misleading element of Jones’ analysis is the firm distinction he draws between some of the communist-inspired insurgencies of the Cold War era and the Islamist ones that have arisen since the early 1990s, which has the effect of obscuring the essentially anticolonial character of both kinds of movements."

Oppenheimer believes he has a remedy for this problem. He does not try to forecast the future; instead, he constructs detailed scenarios that could plausibly take shape, by starting with what is known about the current situation and then imagining different ways in which events and decisions might unfold. Oppenheimer explains his methodology and details a number of scenarios he developed in the recent past for countries such as China, Russia, Syria, and Ukraine. These illustrate the value of the exercise but also, as Oppenheimer acknowledges, its limits. The scenarios reveal more about what was known and understood at the time that Oppenheimer drew them than about what actually happened. Oppenheimer makes a persuasive case that scenario planning can encourage more agility and flexibility in policymaking. He also presents a scathing indictment of U.S. grand strategy—but his proposed remedies for it are not convincing."

It features useful summaries of the factors that caused the recessions and examines the dynamics of the recoveries, drawing largely from scholarly literature. It also provides a good deal of informed commentary on the practice of macroeconomic analysis and on the transmission of economic shocks across national borders. The publication includes many charts and tables, so it’s not for numerophobes. It also comes with a DVD that contains documentary-style interviews with the authors and other economists."

It was therefore a major surprise when, in September 1985, the finance ministers of France, Japan, the United Kingdom, and West Germany met at the Plaza Hotel in New York City with the secretary of the U.S. Treasury, James Baker, and publicly announced that the U.S. dollar was overvalued and that they would take collective action to encourage its depreciation and a corresponding appreciation of the four other major countries’ currencies. The Plaza Accord was followed 17 months later by the Louvre Accord, in which the same group declared that the depreciation had gone far enough and that they would consequently take steps to stabilize exchange rates. How to properly manage exchange rates remains a vexing question for many countries today, one for which there seems to be no enduring correct answer. The 16 contributors to this book—which include Baker and then Fed Chair Paul Volcker, the leading U.S. participants in these events—evaluate the effects of the accords and argue that they serve as an exemplar for macroeconomic cooperation among major countries. That position was controversial at the time and remains so today, partly because some influential Chinese economists maintain—wrongly, as this books demonstrates—that the accords led to the bursting of the Japanese stock market and real estate bubbles at the end of the 1980s, an outcome that present-day China, with its overheated equity and land markets, is eager to avoid."

American and Soviet strategists used game theory to develop their countries’ nuclear postures during the Cold War. Since then, the rise of pro-market, pro-globalization neoliberalism—which favors decision- making based on rational choice and narrow self-interest—has encouraged the spread of game theory into many other aspects of life and society, particularly the realms of business and finance. The author draws an unfavorable contrast between neoliberalism and classical liberal thought, which emphasizes respect for individuals and procedural fairness, counsels decision-makers to do no harm, and considers outcomes other than final payoffs. Like many philosophical inquiries, the book is a bit heavy at times, but it offers a thoughtful examination of the fundamental assumptions on which modern society is based."

It is not a pretty picture. He concludes that the existing business model followed by banks is no longer viable; soon enough, it will once again present political leaders with the dilemma of having to choose between massive bank bailouts and economic catastrophe. There are two fundamental problems: banks are still overleveraged, and they suffer from a mismatch between the liquidity and maturity of their assets and those of their liabilities during times of stress—which will inevitably occur from time to time owing to what King calls the “radical uncertainty” of modern, dynamic economies. In addition to serving up fascinating tidbits of banking history, King proposes a radical transformation of the contemporary banking system. Under his plan, central banks would agree to make loans to cover a bank’s short-term liabilities during a time of crisis as long as the bank had offered acceptable collateral ahead of time. This would greatly bolster the safety of banks but would also require a major revision of how they function."

In his informative book, Lepenies describes the tortuous path by which GDP became so crucial, beginning with the conceptual work on economic measurement carried out by the English economist William Petty in the mid-seventeenth century, to the consolidation of GDP’s role in assessing and managing the British and U.S. economies during World War II, to Washington’s postwar insistence that European recipients of Marshall Plan aid adopt GDP as a metric and collect the data needed to calculate it."

Roosevelt and the Evolution of an American Idea,"U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt’s “Four Freedoms” speech, delivered in January 1941, is widely seen as a landmark statement of American foreign policy. Roosevelt’s purpose was to rally a skeptical U.S. Congress and public to the coming war against the Axis powers and their “new order of tyranny” by offering a lofty vision of a liberal order that would protect American interests and ideals. This thoughtful book of essays attempts to recover the historical moment—what the historian Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., called “those angry days”—surrounding Roosevelt’s speech and assess its long-term legacies. Chapters look at each of the four great rights and protections: freedom of speech and religion and freedom from fear and want. One theme of the book is that very prosaic circumstances and instrumental purposes lay behind Roosevelt’s soaring rhetoric: he was under pressure to convince a reluctant Congress to approve military spending and aid for countries aligned against Nazi Germany and its allies. But another theme is that ideas have consequences. Whatever his immediate goals, Roosevelt ushered in an expansive new conception of international order. As the historian Elizabeth Borgwardt has put it elsewhere, Roosevelt was offering “a New Deal for the world.”"

In this wonderfully engaging book, Tepperman—the managing editor of this magazine—tours the world looking for political success stories that cut against this gloomy outlook. The book identifies ten common but particularly difficult problems, including inequality, immigration, civil war, corruption, and political gridlock, and argues that they are “fixable” when leaders act boldly. For each problem, Tepperman finds a free-thinking and experimental leader (or leaders) who defied the odds and achieved success. In the early years of this century, for example, President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva of Brazil developed a ground-breaking poverty-fighting program, Bolsa Família, that gave small monthly grants to mothers to feed and educate their families. And for the past two decades, the democratic leaders of post-Suharto Indonesia have steered their country toward a moderate form of politics that has undercut Islamist radicalism. From his fascinating travelogue, Tepperman offers lessons for a world in trouble: leaders need to think outside the box, embrace the possibilities that crises present, and respect systems of checks and balances. The pragmatic reform tradition that the book illuminates is apparently still alive."

Shaper Nations represents one of the best snapshots yet of this emerging era, focusing on countries whose economic and military capabilities make them increasingly significant in their regions and beyond: Brazil, China, Germany, India, Israel, Russia, Turkey, and the United States. None of the contributors considers any of these states, including China, to be a “revisionist” power, one that seeks to upend the rules and institutions of the existing order. Rather, shaper nations are themselves shaped and constrained by domestic politics, regional rivalries, and historical memories and grievances—a fact that will make world politics increasingly messy and dysfunctional as such countries become more influential. Paradoxically, today’s rising states combine greater international influence with profound domestic weaknesses and unsettled national identities. Legro speculates that shaper nations will create a global order that is less global and less orderly: as rising powers focus on their own development and neighborhoods, they will deliver fewer public goods."

In this impressive policy manifesto, Blackwill and Harris argue that in recent decades, the United States has tended to neglect this form of statecraft, while China, Russia, and other illiberal states have increasingly employed it to Washington’s disadvantage. China looms especially large in the book, which details Beijing’s reliance on economic carrots and sticks to bring smaller and weaker countries into its political orbit—for example, launching a new development organization to rival the World Bank and laying the groundwork for a new Silk Road across Eurasia. Blackwill and Harris worry that economic statecraft has become a “lost art” in post–Cold War U.S. foreign policy and that the American penchant for separating economics from politics and Washington’s commitment to a rules-based international order have constrained U.S. policymakers. But as the authors acknowledge, Chinese and Russian attempts to use trade and investment for geopolitical purposes often backfire. And crucially, U.S. support for a rules-based system is itself a profoundly geoeconomic strategy that has paid dividends for decades."

54,Venezuela on the Brink,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/venezuela/venezuela-brink,Venezuela on the Brink,"Venezuela is in the throes of its most tumultuous political and economic period in decades. The collapse of global energy prices has wreaked havoc on the country’s economy. Estimates vary, but oil production has fallen from a peak of around 3.2 million barrels per day in 1997 to somewhere between 2.2 million and 2.5 million barrels per day today. Oil and gas account for more than 95 percent of Venezuela’s revenues from exports, and the country produces few other goods. Without the money it makes from exporting energy products, Venezuela has struggled to import everything else its people need. As a result, Venezuelans are facing widespread shortages of food, medicine, and other basic supplies. Citizens wait in line for hours at supermarkets to buy staples such as rice; many have resorted to sifting through trash to find food. Military forces have been dispatched to oversee food production and distribution. Last year, a group of Venezuelan researchers estimated that, in contrast to relatively rosy official statistics, more than three-quarters of Venezuelans are living in poverty. And there is no relief in sight: by the end of the year, the economy will probably have contracted by eight percent and the inflation rate will likely reach 720 percent, according to the International Monetary Fund."
55,The Strategic Costs of Torture,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/strategic-costs-torture,The Strategic Costs of Torture,"It has been more than seven years since U.S. President Barack Obama issued Executive Order 13491, banning the U.S. government’s use of torture. Obama’s directive was a powerful rebuke to the Bush administration, which had, in the years after the 9/11 attacks, authorized the CIA and the U.S. military to use “enhanced interrogation tech­niques” in questioning suspected terrorists. Some detainees were shackled in painful positions, locked in boxes the size of coffins, kept awake for over 100 hours at a time, and forced to inhale water in a process known as water­boarding. Interrogators sometimes went far beyond what Washington had authorized, sodomizing detainees with blunt objects, threatening to sexually abuse their family members, and, on at least one occasion, freezing a suspect to death by chaining him to an ice-cold floor overnight."
56,America’s Brewing Debt Crisis,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/americas-brewing-debt-crisis,America’s Brewing Debt Crisis,"Almost as soon as the financial crisis struck in late 2007, policymakers began working to prevent another one. The roots of the crisis, they contended, lay in reckless lending and excess debt. Banks had made massive loans to “subprime” borrowers, who had little ability to repay them, and the banks funded these investments with borrowed money. When the U.S. housing bubble burst, millions of Americans defaulted on their mortgages, and the overleveraged banks collapsed. The government had to bail them out, and U.S. taxpayers picked up the bill."
57,How to Fix Brazil,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/brazil/how-fix-brazil,How to Fix Brazil,"Brazil has rarely had it so bad. The country’s economy has col­lapsed: since 2013, its unemployment rate has nearly doubled, to more than 11 percent, and last year its GDP shrank by 3.8 per­cent, the largest contraction in a quarter century. Petrobras, Brazil’s semipublic oil giant, has lost around 85 percent of its value since 2008, thanks to declining commodity prices and its role in a massive corruption scandal. The Zika virus has infected thousands of Brazilians, exposing the frailty of the country’s health system. And despite the billions of dollars Brasília poured into the 2014 World Cup and this year’s Olympic Games, those events have done little to improve the national mood or upgrade the country’s urban infrastructure. Meanwhile, many of Brazil’s long-standing problems have proved stubbornly persistent: half of all Brazilians still lack access to basic sanitation, 35 million of them lack access to clean water, and in 2014, the country suffered nearly 60,000 homicides."
58,The Return of Europe’s Nation-States,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/europe/return-europes-nation-states,The Return of Europe’s Nation-States,"Europe currently finds itself in the throes of its worst political crisis since World War II. Across the continent, traditional political parties have lost their appeal as populist, Euroskeptical movements have attracted widespread support. Hopes for European unity seem to grow dimmer by the day. The euro crisis has exposed deep fault lines between Germany and debt-ridden southern European states, including Greece and Portugal. Germany and Italy have clashed on issues such as border controls and banking regulations. And on June 23, the United Kingdom became the first country in history to vote to leave the EU—a stunning blow to the bloc."
59,Keeping Europe Safe,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/europe/keeping-europe-safe,Keeping Europe Safe,"Just before 11 PM on Thursday, July 14, a 19-ton truck turned onto a seaside promenade in Nice, France, where crowds had gathered to watch Bastille Day fireworks. The truck sped up, plowing into the people on the promenade. By the time French police shot the driver, the truck had traveled 1.1 miles, killing 84 people and injuring hundreds more. That attack came less than four months after three terrorists killed 32 people in explosions in the departure hall of Brussels Airport and a metro car near Brussels’ Maelbeek subway station. And it came eight months after a group of young men killed 130 people in Paris, in the deadliest attack on France since World War II. The self-proclaimed Islamic State, or ISIS, claimed responsibility for all three attacks."
60,China’s Infrastructure Play,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/asia/chinas-infrastructure-play,China’s Infrastructure Play,"Over the past three millennia, China has made three attempts to project its economic power westward. The first began in the second century BC, during the Han dynasty, when China’s imperial rulers developed the ancient Silk Road to trade with the far-off residents of Central Asia and the Mediterranean basin; the fall of the Mongol empire and the rise of European maritime trading eventually rendered that route obsolete. In the fifteenth century AD, the maritime expeditions of Admiral Zheng He connected Ming-dynasty China to the littoral states of the Indian Ocean. But China’s rulers recalled Zheng’s fleet less than three decades after it set out, and for the rest of imperial history, they devoted most of their attention to China’s neighbors to the east and south."
61,From Political Islam to Muslim Democracy,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/tunisia/political-islam-muslim-democracy,From Political Islam to Muslim Democracy,"Ennahda, one of the most influential political parties in the Arab world and a major force in Tunisia’s emergence as a democracy, recently announced a historic transition. Ennahda has moved beyond its origins as an Islamist party and has fully embraced a new identity as a party of Muslim democrats. The organization, which I co-founded in the 1980s, is no longer both a political party and a social movement. It has ended all of its cultural and religious activities and now focuses only on politics."
62,Building on Success,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2016-08-07/building-success,Building on Success,"The next administration will take the reins of American foreign policy in a world that is more complex than at any point in our modern history, including the twilight of the Cold War and the years that followed the 9/11 attacks. But it is also the case that despite the proliferation of threats and challenges—some old, some new—by almost any measure, we are stronger and more secure today than when President Barack Obama and I took office in January 2009. Because of our investments at home and engagement overseas, the United States is primed to remain the world’s preeminent power for decades to come. In more than 40 years of public service, I have never been more optimistic about America’s future—if only we continue to lead."
63,Ending Endless War,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2016-08-03/ending-endless-war,Ending Endless War,"During the Cold War, the United States preferred to husband, rather than expend, its military power. The idea was not to fight but to defend, deter, and contain, a cold peace infinitely preferable to nuclear cataclysm. When U.S. policymakers strayed from this principle, attempting to unify the Korean Peninsula in 1950 or deploying combat troops to Vietnam in the 1960s, the results proved unhappy in the extreme."
64,Preserving Primacy,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/north-america/2016-08-03/preserving-primacy,Preserving Primacy,"The next U.S. president will inherit a security environment in which the United States con­fronts mounting threats with increasingly constrained resources, diminished stature, and growing uncertainty both at home and abroad over its willingness to protect its friends and its interests. Revisionist powers in Europe, the western Pacific, and the Persian Gulf—three regions long considered by both Democratic and Republican administrations to be vital to U.S. national security—are seeking to overturn the rules-based international order. In Europe, Russian President Vladimir Putin has seized Crimea, waged proxy warfare in eastern Ukraine, and threatened NATO allies on Russia’s periphery. Further demonstrating its newfound assertiveness, Russia has dispatched forces to Syria and strength­ened its nuclear arsenal. After a failed attempt to “reset” relations with Moscow, U.S. President Barack Obama has issued stern warnings and imposed economic sanctions, but these have done little to deter Putin."
65,Rethinking Nuclear Policy,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/united-states/rethinking-nuclear-policy,Rethinking Nuclear Policy,"Four months into his presidency, at a summit in Prague, Barack Obama pledged to take “concrete steps toward a world without nuclear weapons.” Yet nearly eight years later, he presides over a program to modernize the entire U.S. nuclear arsenal at a cost of $35 billion a year through the next decade and beyond. To those who accuse him of hypocrisy, Obama has said that he always regarded a nuclear-free world as a long-term goal, unlikely to be met in his lifetime, much less his time in office—and that his modernization program is designed not to build more or more deadly nuclear weapons but rather to maintain and secure the arsenal the United States has now."
66,America’s Awesome Military,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/americas/2016-07-22/america-s-awesome-military,America’s Awesome Military,"The United States has the best military in the world today, by far. U.S. forces have few, if any, weaknesses, and in many areas—from naval warfare to precision-strike capabilities, to airpower, to intelligence and reconnaissance, to special operations—they play in a totally different league from the militaries of other countries. Nor is this situation likely to change anytime soon, as U.S. defense spending is almost three times as large as that of the United States’ closest competitor, China, and accounts for about one-third of all global military expenditures—with another third coming from U.S. allies and partners."
67,Parting the South China Sea,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2016-07-22/parting-south-china-sea,Parting the South China Sea,"July 12, 2016, marked a turning point in the long-standing disputes over the South China Sea. After more than three years of proceedings at the Permanent Court of Arbitration, an international body in The Hague, a tribunal constituted under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) issued a widely anticipated decision in a case the Philippines brought in 2013 to challenge China’s maritime claims to most of the contested waterway."

0,The Long Road to Suffrage,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/review-essay/2020-10-13/long-road-suffrage,The Long Road to Suffrage,"As Hillary Clinton proclaimed near the end of a fiery speech delivered to an international audience in Beijing in 1995, “Human rights are women’s rights, and women’s rights are human rights.” Some officials at the U.S. State Department were nervous about her address, believing that even such a seemingly benign mention of human rights would irritate the Chinese hosts of the UN-sponsored Fourth World Conference on Women. But in the United States and elsewhere, the phrase resonated—and still does."
1,The Underappreciated Power,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/japan/2020-10-13/underappreciated-power,The Underappreciated Power,"In an era of renewed great-power competition that Washington has framed as an all-out, zero-sum battle between “the free world” and a menacing China, East Asia’s other great power, Japan, has gotten short shrift. Japan does not aspire to superpower status, and its limitations are well known: demographic decline, a deflationary economy, and self-imposed restrictions on the use of force abroad. But it would be a mistake to write off Japan as a has-been. It boasts a resilient democracy and a successful track record of adjusting to economic globalization. For decades, Japan has been a leader in infrastructure finance in developing countries. And it has acquired sterling credentials as a leader on free trade. When it comes to the use of economic engagement as a diplomatic tool, Japan—not the United States—is China’s peer competitor."
2,The Decider,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/review-essay/2020-10-13/decider,The Decider,"“A man is not deceived by others; he deceives himself.” This quotation, from Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, serves as the fitting epigraph to Robert Draper’s riveting new book on U.S. President George W. Bush’s decision to go to war in Iraq. In contrast to most accounts of the decision-making process that led to the invasion in March 2003, To Start a War stresses that the president himself was the decider—not Dick Cheney, the vice president; not Donald Rumsfeld, the secretary of defense; not Paul Wolfowitz, the deputy secretary of defense; not Scooter Libby, the vice president’s chief of staff. Moreover, Draper clarifies that Iraq was not the administration’s obsessive preoccupation from the very beginning. The surprise attack on 9/11 changed the president’s calculus, creating a direct line from that tragic event to the even more tragic decision to invade Iraq. Bush frequently insisted that he had not yet made up his mind, but Draper claims that he was deceiving himself. “In truth, Bush had stacked his own deck,” Draper writes. “Prizing loyalty above all else, he had surrounded himself with subordinates who believed that their job was to support the president’s value judgments rather than to question them.”"
3,No Exit,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2020-10-13/no-exit,No Exit,"The record of American failure in the Middle East over the last two decades is long and dismaying. The most obvious catastrophe was the 2003 invasion of Iraq. But the trouble started long before that fiasco. The U.S. victory in the Cold War, the “third wave” of democratization around the world, and the wealth that globalization generated were positive developments, but they also produced a toxic mix of American arrogance and overambition. Across the political spectrum, officials and analysts came to believe that Middle Eastern societies needed Washington’s help and that the United States could use its power in constructive ways in the region. What followed were fruitless quests to transform Arab societies, resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, stamp out jihadism, and end Iran’s development of nuclear technology. The fact that five Arab countries are now in various stages of collapse contributes to an overall sense within Washington that the U.S. approach requires a radical overhaul."
4,China Thinks America Is Losing,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2020-10-13/china-thinks-america-losing,China Thinks America Is Losing,"The consequences of the presidency of Donald Trump will be debated for decades to come—but for the Chinese leadership, its meaning is already clear. China’s rulers believe that the past four years have shown that the United States is rapidly declining and that this deterioration has caused Washington to frantically try to suppress China’s rise. Trump’s trade war, technology bans, and determination to blame China for his own mishandling of the COVID-19 pandemic have all confirmed the perception of Chinese policy elites that the United States is bent on keeping their country down."
5,The Lawless Realm,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/world/2020-10-13/lawless-realm,The Lawless Realm,"This past summer, a host of public organizations as varied as the Norwegian parliament, the New Zealand stock exchange, and the Vatican all came under attack. No shots were fired, no doors knocked down, no bombs exploded. Instead, the attackers managed to intrude into these institutions’ internal networks in attempts to commit espionage, disrupt daily affairs, or ransom or blackmail victims. Incidents of this kind are just the tip of the iceberg. Cyberattacks are constantly taking place, and many intrusions go unnoticed and unreported. In democratic countries, only intelligence agencies and private companies can reach a detailed understanding of cyberattacks and the risks they pose. Everyone else must scramble for information about what actually happens below the surface of the digital world."

Organized corruption, which has been rocking the globe for more than a decade, is finally appearing in plain sight."
7,The Book Collectors: A Band of Syrian Rebels and the Stories That Carried Them Through a War,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2020-10-13/book-collectors-band-syrian-rebels-and-stories-carried-them,The Book Collectors: A Band of Syrian Rebels and the Stories That Carried Them Through a War,"Originally published in French in 2017, this slim volume recounts the bond that Minoui, a reporter for the French newspaper Le Figaro who is based in Istanbul, developed with a small group of Syrian rebels in Daraya, a suburb of Damascus. Besieged for four years, these fighters won admiration in the West for their determination and their unusual deference to local civilian control. They made headlines, it must also be acknowledged, because they made themselves accessible to Western journalists. In the modern equivalent of an epistolary relationship, Minoui found them on Facebook and communicated with them through FaceTime, Skype, and WhatsApp. Much of what she recounts about the siege was reported at the time, but the book is nevertheless revealing. The rebels maintained a library, cobbled together from what was left in burned-out bookshops and demolished homes. It was an eclectic collection—including works by the medieval historian Ibn Khaldun, the Palestinian poet Mahmoud Darwish, the Brazilian novelist Paulo Coelho, and the American self-help guru Stephen Covey—and it evidently provided instruction, solace, and purpose to men (as they all were) under extraordinary duress. Just like prisons across the region, rebel strongholds are sometimes universities in exile; witnessing the unexpected joy of learning in such circumstances is both sobering and inspiring."
8,Fraternal Enemies: Israel and the Gulf Monarchies,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2020-10-13/fraternal-enemies-israel-and-gulf-monarchies,Fraternal Enemies: Israel and the Gulf Monarchies,"Although the United Arab Emirates didn’t seem likely to be the first in line, the announcement in August that Israel would normalize relations with a Gulf country was not a surprise to most Middle East watchers. As Jones and Guzansky show, the deal was a long time in the making. This thorough, detailed, and timely look at the history of increasingly close, if discreet, trade ties and security cooperation between Israel and all the Gulf monarchies combines the scholarly perspective of Jones, a professor in the United Kingdom, and the experience of Guzansky, a former security adviser in the Israeli government. They argue that these relationships can be understood as a “tacit security regime” among regional states confronting similar challenges, notably the advance of Iran and the retreat of the United States. The book’s real value is its fast-paced tour through decades of plausible deniability, profitable business deals, and increasing intelligence cooperation. It is well sourced; the authors refuse to indulge in speculation. But it remains an open question whether the policies of any of the players stem from the realpolitik of state interests or from the domestic political calculations and personal inclinations of particular rulers."

10,A National Security Reckoning,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2020-10-09/hillary-clinton-national-security-reckoning,A National Security Reckoning,"In a year marked by plague and protest, Americans are reckoning with long-overdue questions about racial justice, economic inequality, and disparities in health care. The current crisis should also prompt a reckoning about the United States’ national security priorities. The country is dangerously unprepared for a range of threats, not just future pandemics but also an escalating climate crisis and multidimensional challenges from China and Russia. Its industrial and technological strength has atrophied, its vital supply chains are vulnerable, its alliances are frayed, and its government is hollowed out. In the past, it sometimes has taken a dramatic shock—Pearl Harbor, Sputnik, 9/11—to wake up the United States to a new threat and prompt a major pivot. The COVID-19 crisis should be a big enough jolt to rouse the country from its sleep, so that it can summon its strength and meet the challenges ahead."
11,Heads in the Sand,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/world/heads-sand,Heads in the Sand,"We are living in a time of crisis. From the immediate challenge of the COVID-19 pandemic to the looming existential threat of climate change, the world is grappling with massive global dangers—to say nothing of countless problems within countries, such as inequality, cyberattacks, unemployment, systemic racism, and obesity. In any given crisis, the right response is often clear. Wear a mask and keep away from other people. Burn less fossil fuel. Redistribute income. Protect digital infrastructure. The answers are out there. What’s lacking are governments that can translate them into actual policy. As a result, the crises continue. The death toll from the pandemic skyrockets, and the world makes dangerously slow progress on climate change, and so on."
12,As the World Burns,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/world/2020-10-13/world-burns,As the World Burns,"In late August, more than 600 separate wildfires ravaged California, killing seven people. Meanwhile, two tropical cyclones struck the Gulf Coast only days apart: first Tropical Storm Marco and then Hurricane Laura, the latter of which killed 26 people in the United States and tied the record for the strongest storm to hit Louisiana. Extreme events such as these signal a worrying trend. In the coming decades, as temperatures continue to climb, seemingly isolated climate disasters will begin to overlap, their impacts becoming more than additive. Scientists expect to see more intense tropical cyclones and more heat waves. Each disaster could compound the damage of the next, with less and less time for people to recover in between."
13,Escaping the Conflict Trap: Toward Ending Civil Wars in the Middle East,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/escaping-conflict-trap-toward-ending-civil-wars-middle-east,Escaping the Conflict Trap: Toward Ending Civil Wars in the Middle East,"Until recently, the case could be made that discord in the Middle East was as much bluster as bloodletting, certainly by the standards of warfare in twentieth-century Europe. During the past decade, however, violence in the region has intensified to an extraordinarily damaging, and apparently intractable, degree. This edited volume includes serviceable case studies of the wars in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Syria, and Yemen and several useful essays that explore the global and regional context and the historical record of efforts to end such conflicts. Two main questions arise: To what extent are these national conflicts the product of regional rivalries among larger powers, and would these civil wars persist without the interference of the Egyptian, Emirati, Iranian, Israeli, Qatari, Saudi, and Turkish governments? And why have international actors, notably Russia, the United States, and European countries, not used their leverage with regional allies and clients to help end these conflicts? One contributor, the former U.S. diplomat Chester Crocker, provides what must be the answer: “In the end, we face the sobering reminder that most armed actors have interests other than peace.”"
14,Hybrid Actors: Armed Groups and State Fragmentation in the Middle East,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/hybrid-actors-armed-groups-and-state-fragmentation-middle-east,Hybrid Actors: Armed Groups and State Fragmentation in the Middle East,"Cambanis and his colleagues at the Century Foundation have produced a timely and provocative discussion about a particularly challenging kind of armed nonstate actor in the Middle East. In addition to independent warlords and state proxies, they identify a third type of nonstate entity, the “hybrid actor,” who “sometimes operates in concert with the state and sometimes competes with it.” They provide a number of examples. Hezbollah of Lebanon is the archetype, but Iraqi Kurdish parties also qualify, as do the Popular Mobilization Forces in Iraq. All such actors are “both a symptom and a driver of state fragility, poor governance, and insecurity.” Iran has a comparative advantage in working with these hybrids since, like most of them, Tehran seeks to shift the status quo. By contrast, Western powers are flummoxed when dealing with government ministries controlled by groups designated in the West as terrorist organizations. But hybrid groups cannot be wished away, and policymakers must better understand this new feature of the regional landscape."
15,Re-engaging the Middle East: A New Vision for U.S. Policy,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2020-10-13/re-engaging-middle-east-new-vision-us-policy,Re-engaging the Middle East: A New Vision for U.S. Policy,"Rand and Miller, both veterans of the administration of U.S. President Barack Obama and advisers to the current presidential campaign of former Vice President Joe Biden, use this edited volume to present a vision for future U.S. policy in the Middle East. Their contributors come largely from what they call “the emerging generation of Middle East experts,” and the results are mostly edifying: a collection of knowledgeable and restrained—albeit fairly predictable—treatments of U.S. interests and options in the Middle East. Although they strike a deliberate contrast to U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration in both tone and substance, the authors are also refreshingly candid about the failures of the Obama administration in the Middle East. But they continue to struggle with some of the same dilemmas: the United States is overcommitted in the region, but, as Trump also found, “rightsizing” is fraught with its own risks. The contributors invoke U.S. “moral leadership” and call for “humility,” but such talk can ring hollow in light of U.S. reluctance to defend the rights of Palestinians and human rights more broadly in the region. Perhaps the most important blind spot is the frequent confusion of the interests of states with the calculus of regimes, a distinction U.S. policymakers will have to make if they want to navigate the challenges of the Middle East."
16,The Last Brahmin: Henry Cabot Lodge Jr. and the Making of the Cold War,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/last-brahmin-henry-cabot-lodge-jr-and-making-cold-war,The Last Brahmin: Henry Cabot Lodge Jr. and the Making of the Cold War,"Through a long, extraordinary career, Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr., advised five U.S. presidents of both political parties. The first to see the political potential of Dwight Eisenhower, Lodge entered him in the New Hampshire primary without his knowledge and then managed his winning presidential campaign. Lodge served as ambassador to the United Nations from 1953 to 1960, when that position wielded enormous influence, and twice served as ambassador to Vietnam (first in the Kennedy administration and then in the Johnson administration), the toughest job in U.S. foreign policy at the time. Later, under President Richard Nixon, he chaired the Paris peace talks that brought the Vietnam War to an end in 1973. Pointed from childhood toward a career of public service, Lodge embodied the Eastern Establishment. He abhorred memoirs and never wrote his own, although it would have made an important contribution to history, especially regarding Vietnam. Characteristically, he thought he might write an account for posthumous publication “as a matter of duty” but later chose not to. Nichter’s biography goes a long way to correcting Lodge’s omission, filling in the blanks on the life of this fascinating man who played a central role in U.S. foreign policy for more than three decades."
17,Isolationism: A History of America’s Efforts to Shield Itself From the World,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2020-10-13/isolationism-history-americas-efforts-shield-itself-world,Isolationism: A History of America’s Efforts to Shield Itself From the World,"Most Americans think of isolationism in relation to the U.S. foreign policies of the 1920s and 1930s, which disastrously helped lead to World War II. But the country’s association with isolationism, Kupchan argues, stretches back to its founding and forward to recent years. In this valuable volume, he reexamines the full sweep of U.S. history through this lens in a bid to “refurbish” this oft-maligned foreign policy tendency. In this comprehensive history of the subject, he shows that disengagement from the world served the country well through long periods of its early history. He compellingly demonstrates that the notion of American exceptionalism was as closely tied to isolationism—the “city on a hill,” standing above and apart from a quarrelsome world—as it later would be to the country’s postwar internationalism, when the United States saw itself as “the indispensable nation.” Kupchan believes that a strategic pullback from the interventionist foreign policy of the past 80 years or so is inevitable. Indeed, he marshals evidence to argue that such a withdrawal is already well underway. He worries, however, that years of U.S. strategic overreach could give way to the obverse: a retreat that is too rapid, too sweeping, and not thought through. He offers some common-sense guidelines to achieving a more balanced middle ground."
18,Party Proliferation and Political Contestation in Africa: Senegal in Comparative Perspective,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/party-proliferation-and-political-contestation-africa-senegal-comparative,Party Proliferation and Political Contestation in Africa: Senegal in Comparative Perspective,"In her well-informed study, Kelly examines recent electoral politics in Senegal through the prism of party competition. She starts with the puzzle that nearly 300 political parties are officially registered in Senegal even though only a handful have ever won seats in parliament in more than a single election. Why do so many parties compete in elections despite the fact that they are unlikely to win seats, and what does this profusion tell us about Senegal’s politics? Kelly argues convincingly that unlike in older, more established democracies, most parties in Senegal do not exist for the purpose of winning elections. Instead, they are mostly the instruments through which individual politicians negotiate their access to the state and its resources. Her book documents this process carefully, following the creation of specific parties and the resulting paths of particular politicians. She shows how incumbents have resorted to extensive patronage to shore up their positions and weaken opposition parties. Senegal has had a longer tradition of multiparty electoral competition than most of its African neighbors, and so it may offer clues about long-term trends in the region."
19,Riverblindness in Africa: Taming the  Lion’s Stare,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/riverblindness-africa-taming-lions-stare,Riverblindness in Africa: Taming the  Lion’s Stare,"River blindness, or onchocerciasis, is caused by a parasitic worm that is spread by the bites of a small black fly that is common around rivers in much of Africa. The disease still afflicts some 15 million to 20 million Africans, of whom around a million have suffered vision loss. Benton, who ran the World Bank’s river blindness project for over 20 years, has written a very useful history of the efforts by African governments and a consortium of donors to control and eventually eradicate the disease. He ably documents the policy process, the bureaucratic politics, and the individual actions that such a complex effort required. No vaccine is available yet, and so policymakers have no alternative but to support the slow and laborious work of trying to eradicate the disease-carrying fly with insecticides. Also, since 1981, the drug ivermectin has been found to be effective in killing the larvae of the worms inside the human body. Campaigns to provide two injections of the drug a year to affected populations have played a key role in controlling the disease."
20,Two Books on Ghana,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2020-10-13/two-books-ghana,Two Books on Ghana,"Two complementary books astutely assess Ghana’s uneven political and economic record. They share the view that a focus on formal institutions alone will not account for either political or economic outcomes. Studying the slums of Accra with the keen eye of an ethnographer, Paller argues that understanding local identity politics helps explain why Ghana’s political system remains largely undemocratic, despite the façade of democratic institutions. Clientelistic relationships that follow complicated ethnic logics dominate everyday life and discourage the development of a broader civic culture. Paller supports his thesis with fascinating analyses of several communities within urban Accra and their ability to provide public goods to their members. He shows that the patterns of ethnic settlement in the city have led to different “politics of belonging.” Communities made up mostly of newcomers are better able to generate local political systems that are more responsive to citizens and deliver higher-quality social services. Paller finds that these communities may not benefit from as large budgetary allocations as the more established indigenous-dominated neighborhoods, but they manage their budgets better, with the garbage picked up more regularly and public toilets better maintained. As for the mixed communities, which include both indigenous people and immigrants, the local politics there tends to be harder-edged, and residents in such places receive fewer public goods."
21,Travelling While Black: Essays Inspired by a Life on the Move,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2020-10-13/travelling-while-black-essays-inspired-life-move,Travelling While Black: Essays Inspired by a Life on the Move,"What unites these wide-ranging essays is a common concern with migration, racism, and the author’s own identity as a Black, Western-educated Kenyan woman who travels constantly for professional and touristic reasons. Ultimately, she argues, it is by leaving home that people find their identity. She visits Haiti as a volunteer for a human rights group and ruminates on the fact that locals call her “white” because she is foreign and educated. Other essays explore her outrage at European immigration policy and its human cost and the question of whether mobility should be a human right and not just the purview of a small, usually Western and white elite. The book also features a lovely essay about the life and legacy of the South African author Bessie Head, who lived much of her life in exile in Botswana and died in relative poverty. The passion, erudition, and fluidity of Nyabola’s writing is attractive, even when the arguments occasionally fail to convince. Provocative and always willing to take on the conventional wisdom, Nyabola emerges with this book as an important observer of contemporary Africa and its position in the world."
22,Russia and America: The Asymmetric Rivalry,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2020-10-13/russia-and-america-asymmetric-rivalry,Russia and America: The Asymmetric Rivalry,"Throughout his meticulously sourced and dispassionate analysis of U.S.-Russian relations, Tsygankov tries to focus on Russian interests—a rare approach in a time when so many observers commonly regard Russia as a malign actor. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, the United States failed to understand that Russia, although dramatically weakened, would never accept being a junior partner on the international stage. Russia has grown stronger and more assertive in the last 15 years, leading Washington to increasingly treat Moscow as a rival and adversary. Despite its relative weakness, Russia has been able to remain competitive by engaging in “asymmetric rivalry” with the United States. In response to the upheaval in Ukraine in 2014, Russian President Vladimir Putin opted for covert military interventions in Crimea and eastern Ukraine, while U.S. and European leaders failed to force Russia to conduct a restrained foreign policy. Russia has also exercised asymmetric power in the global information space, seeking to confuse and discredit its Western opponents. And as U.S. influence has been receding in Asia, Russia has strengthened its pivot to China and expanded its role in the Middle East. Tsygankov warns that further confrontation lies ahead: if the West continues to challenge Russia’s status, Putin will fight back."

Each side claimed to report the truth and condemned the other for spreading lies and propaganda. Both Soviet and U.S. coverage incessantly emphasized the respective systems’ political and cultural superiority: Soviet reporters condemned the racism, unemployment, and disparity of incomes in the United States, and Americans exposed the lack of freedom and the squalor of everyday life in the Soviet Union. Their modes of operation were, indeed, different: Soviet journalists had to clear their writings through state censors, whereas the Americans cooperated with their government in a more informal, indirect way through their choice of topics or angles. U.S. reporters prided themselves on their journalistic objectivity even as they willingly passed information on to U.S. officials; meanwhile, their colleagues at home took critical stands against the government in covering the Watergate affair, the Pentagon Papers, and the Vietnam War."
24,Young Heroes of the Soviet Union: A Memoir and a Reckoning,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2020-10-13/young-heroes-soviet-union-memoir-and-reckoning,Young Heroes of the Soviet Union: A Memoir and a Reckoning,"Halberstadt was a child when he immigrated to the United States from the Soviet Union with his Jewish mother. In a pattern common to young American writers of foreign descent, he began to feel the irresistible draw of “the old country” as he grew older. As an adult, he returned to Russia to search for his family roots and to repair ties with his father. Over the course of the journey, related in this memoir, he describes the barbarities of Stalin’s bloody regime as well as the extermination of Jews by the Nazis and their enthusiastic collaborators in Lithuania and Ukraine, the two places his family came from. He meets his paternal grandfather, a member of Stalin’s secret police and likely an executioner himself. To a Russian ear, Halberstadt’s stories sound conventional and even a bit clichéd: his descriptions of Soviet poverty, humiliating shortages, pervasive censorship, ubiquitous lies, and the late Soviet infatuation with Western pop culture are all familiar. A Russian reader is sure to catch a few inaccuracies. In the end, during a quiet fishing trip in a faraway Russian province, the author develops a kind of awkward affection for his father. He does not become any more Russian, but he leaves Russia a wiser man."
25,Agent Sonya: Moscow’s Most Daring Wartime Spy,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/agent-sonya-moscows-most-daring-wartime-spy,Agent Sonya: Moscow’s Most Daring Wartime Spy,"Macintyre’s new page-turner is the true story of Ursula Kuczynski, a German Jew, a passionate Communist, and an amazingly efficient Soviet spy code-named “Sonya.” The Soviet agent Richard Sorge recruited Kuczynski in Shanghai in the early 1930s; in the 1940s, she was the handler of the Manhattan Project physicist Klaus Fuchs, who slipped her documents providing the nuclear know-how that proved essential to the Soviet Union’s development of an atomic bomb. Sonya lived a double life, running an extremely perilous spy operation while also being a housewife and a loving mother of three. Like many successful spies, she benefited from incredible luck. When Stalin executed most of his foreign intelligence agents, Sonya was miraculously spared. When her children’s nanny denounced her to the British authorities, they dismissed the nanny’s claims as far-fetched. In 1950, just as MI5 was about to arrest her, she managed to escape to East Germany. She told her Soviet minders there that she would like to end her spy career, and they accepted her decision: a unique case of a Soviet spy granted early retirement. She began a new life as a popular novelist and died in 2000 at the age of 93."

Stalin relentlessly tried to expand his control over parts of Europe, including in Albania, Austria, Finland, and even a Danish island. In this captivating historical account, Naimark picks several episodes from the early postwar period to show that some of Europe’s eventual Cold War divisions were not inevitable. Some European leaders were able to guide their countries out from under Soviet domination by drawing on their diplomatic savvy. Austria, for example, did not extract itself from Soviet occupation until 1955; Karl Renner, its first postwar leader, succeeded in building a broad antifascist coalition and maintaining a multiparty democratic system while still demonstrating loyalty to Stalin. In 1946, after careful bargaining, Denmark’s government managed to put an end to the occupation of the Danish island of Bornholm, which the Red Army had seized in 1945. Finland secured domestic independence by sacrificing military and diplomatic sovereignty to the Soviet Union. The Albanian leader Enver Hoxha took advantage of the Soviet-Yugoslav split to free Albania from the hold of Tito’s Yugoslavia, and later on, he broke with the Soviet leadership, too, to become his nation’s sole ruler, unrestrained by foreign powers."
27,Black Spartacus: The Epic Life of Toussaint Louverture,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/black-spartacus-epic-life-toussaint-louverture,Black Spartacus: The Epic Life of Toussaint Louverture,"Hazareesingh likens the Haitian revolutionary hero Toussaint Louverture to his contemporary nemesis, Napoléon Bonaparte. Like the French emperor, Toussaint possessed superior leadership skills, a remarkable memory for places and faces, and indefatigable physical and mental energy. Both men were bold military strategists, prodigious lawmakers, prolific communicators, and micromanagers. In their younger years, both Toussaint and Napoléon espoused the egalitarian ideas of the European Enlightenment; once in power, the exigencies of their offices brought forth more autocratic impulses. Ultimately, an accumulation of errors and the treachery of trusted associates led to defeat and exile for both legendary figures. Hazareesingh defends Toussaint against critics from the left and the right, arguing that the charismatic Haitian battled courageously for an inclusive, multiracial society, proud of its Blackness but respectful of European civilization. In sharp contrast to his more radical, vengeful successors, Toussaint succeeded in achieving some degree of economic productivity and political order while ruling Haiti. In 1998, Toussaint was admitted into the Panthéon, the sacred Parisian abode of France’s most eminent leaders."

He went on to apply modern methods of industrial organization, the latest agricultural innovations, and muscular brand-marketing strategies to the cultivation and sale of coffee. The Hill family prospered immensely, becoming prominent leaders of the local oligarchy. With government complicity, the planters dismantled indigenous communal farms to make way for their private enterprises, transforming, as the historian Sedgewick describes in this highly readable, provocative new book, “a relatively equal, peaceful place into one of the most unequal and violent countries in the history of the modern world.” Plantation owners paid their laborers near-starvation wages, which, Sedgewick contends, led to violent popular rebellions in 1932 and 1979. But Sedgewick provides little fresh quantitative evidence to support such polemic assertions. He briefly sketches an alternative system of “food sovereignty,” which frames the local production and consumption of varied and healthy food as a human right."
29,Two Books on China and Latin America,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2020-10-13/two-books-china-and-latin-america,Two Books on China and Latin America,"Two books explore the burgeoning ties between China and Latin America. Wise is largely optimistic about China’s commercial presence in the region, whereas Stallings describes a relationship of growing, but not necessarily malign, dependency. Wise counters the claim, sometimes voiced by the Trump administration, that exploitative Chinese trade and investment practices endanger Latin American economies. She strenuously argues that closer commercial ties can benefit both China and Latin American countries. China has turned to resource-rich Latin America not because it harbors hegemonic ambitions but because it is heavily dependent on imported raw materials and foodstuffs. China’s rise has improved the international economic environment for many Latin American countries and widened their room for maneuver. Positive outcomes, however, are not guaranteed. Wise convincingly demonstrates that Latin American countries must make smart domestic choices to best take advantage of their ties with China. The larger economies (Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico) have mostly failed to build and maintain the governing institutions that could profitably channel Chinese commercial interests. In a particularly stimulating chapter, Wise points to three smaller, smarter states—Chile, Costa Rica, and Peru—that have benefited handsomely from their relations with China. Each of those countries boasts relatively strong regulatory oversight, an attractive investment climate, and sophisticated export-promotion policies."

But Alba, a noted demographer and social scientist, argues that this projection is misleading. More than ten percent of babies born in the United States now are of mixed parentage, far more than Asian-only children and not many fewer than babies of two Black parents. Data sources are beginning to count people of mixed origins in their own grouping—rather than allotting them to one or another ethnic or racial category—making visible the reality of current trends. The surge in mixed families presages a more fluid picture than the vision of a minority-white country divided by rigid racial categories with competing cultures and interests. Alba envisions a trajectory of assimilation in the twenty-first century in which mainstream culture expands, growing increasingly diverse. Alba writes with an admirable absence of jargon. His data-driven but fully accessible work advances an original and important idea that, if correct, will have major societal consequences."
31,Rogue Superpower,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2020-10-06/illiberal-american-century-rogue-superpower,Rogue Superpower,"President Donald Trump came into office promising to overhaul U.S. foreign policy. Since then, he has scorned allies, withdrawn the United States from international agreements, and slapped tariffs on friends and foes alike. Many experts bemoan the damage Trump’s “America first” policy has done to the so-called liberal international order—the set of institutions and norms that have governed world politics since the end of World War II. They hope that once Trump has left the Oval Office, the United States will resume its role as leader of a liberalizing world."
32,Two Books on the Republican Party,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2020-10-13/two-books-republican-party,Two Books on the Republican Party,"The future of the Republican Party depends on how its members come to terms with its transformation under U.S. President Donald Trump. Judging from two early attempts to explain what has happened, the prospects for consensus appear remote. Seib began his career as an editor and columnist at The Wall Street Journal around the time of Ronald Reagan’s election as president. Perhaps as a result, the narrative revolves around Reagan as he merged the traditional conservative movement and the Republican Party, creating “the most powerful force in American politics” for the ensuing 40 years. Nothing important happens, in this telling, before Reagan. Ultimately, as Seib sees it, Reagan’s creation was the victim of its own success. The party gathered too many followers with widely different views (including both those who wanted to keep government out of the bedroom and those who wanted to ban abortion and gay marriage) and ignored the economic and demographic changes happening around it. Signs of trouble included the populist campaigns of Pat Buchanan and Ross Perot in the 1990s; the anti-intellectual and antiestablishment politics of the 2008 GOP vice-presidential candidate, Sarah Palin; the Tea Party revolt; and the more recent heated rhetoric over immigration."
33,Strategic Instincts: The Adaptive Advantages of Cognitive Biases in International Politics,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/strategic-instincts-adaptive-advantages-cognitive-biases-international,Strategic Instincts: The Adaptive Advantages of Cognitive Biases in International Politics,"It is now widely accepted that psychological biases affect decision-making in economics and politics, with the strong implication that individuals should train themselves to compensate for these biases and behave more like rational actors. In this rich book, full of insights, Johnson challenges the view that such corrections are either necessary or desirable. Ingrained biases, he argues, are really evolutionary adaptations to fast-moving, uncertain situations. They served a purpose, and perhaps they still do. In war, leaders who are more confident than situations warrant may inspire their followers to an improbable victory. A strong bias in favor of one’s own group may reinforce solidarity in the face of an opponent trying to divide and rule. Johnson draws on examples from the American War of Independence, World War I, the Cuban missile crisis, and other conflicts to identify the circumstances in which biases helped produce positive outcomes."
34,The War for the Seas: A Maritime History of World War II,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2020-10-13/war-seas-maritime-history-world-war-ii,The War for the Seas: A Maritime History of World War II,"Mawdsley presents a scrupulous and magisterial account of naval warfare from 1939 to 1945. Sea power could not win World War II on its own, but the Allies were able to win it on land only by gaining command of the sea. Mawdsley manages to cover a lot of ground, examining the navies of all the belligerents without letting the narrative flag. He develops his judgments of key operations with care and clarity. Without detracting from the bravery of the Royal Air Force fighter pilots who fought against the Luftwaffe in the Battle of Britain, he shows that it was British naval superiority that forced Hitler to abandon plans to invade the United Kingdom. The famous code breakers of Bletchley Park have long received credit for winning the battle of the Atlantic, but Mawdsley points to the various technical and tactical advances in anti-submarine warfare that helped Allied convoys cross the sea. His analysis of the role of carrier-based fighter-bombers in the Pacific and the U.S. victory at the Battle of Midway in 1942—from which the Japanese never fully recovered—is more familiar but still well done."
35,Two Books on U.S. Doctors During World War II,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/two-books-us-doctors-during-world-war-ii,Two Books on U.S. Doctors During World War II,"Two books describe how American doctors became connected to troubling events during World War II that raised thorny moral issues around medicine and war. Nolan’s grandfather, the doctor James Nolan, was an early recruit to the medical team at Los Alamos during the Manhattan Project. He accompanied the first atomic bomb in its transport to the Pacific for use against Japan and visited Hiroshima and Nagasaki after the war to prepare reports on the medical effects of the bombing. Although Nolan was distressed by what he saw in Japan, his grandson seems disappointed that there is little evidence of his grandfather opposing either the bomb’s use or U.S. efforts to underplay the bomb’s radio- logical effects. The book usefully dwells on the harm caused by the refusal to acknowledge these risks, regardless of who faced them. The U.S. Navy, for instance, too readily exposed American servicemen to harmful radiation after the Bikini Atoll nuclear tests of 1946."
36,"Our Bodies, Their Battlefields: War Through the Lives of Women",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2020-10-13/our-bodies-their-battlefields-war-through-lives-women,"Our Bodies, Their Battlefields: War Through the Lives of Women","In ancient times, victory in war frequently led to rape and plunder. Little has changed over the centuries. Soldiers rationalize rape as a form of punishment for those of the “wrong” nation or the “wrong” religion. Rape is often not the collateral damage of war but one of its instruments. It serves a strategic purpose: to coerce and humiliate. With extraordinary persistence, Lamb sought out contemporary victims and encouraged them to tell their stories about sexual slavery, routine abuse, trauma, and stigma. The book includes the accounts of “comfort women” taken by the Japanese from Korea before and during World War II, grandmothers in Argentina trying to locate the children of their daughters who were murdered by the ruling junta in the 1970s, Bengalis who were raped on an industrial scale by West Pakistani soldiers in 1971, Yazidis brutalized by the Islamic State (or ISIS) in 2014, Nigerian schoolgirls kidnapped by Boko Haram in 2014, and Rohingya women escaping to Bangladesh from Myanmar in 2017. This harrowing but important book is the work of an empathetic and tenacious chronicler."

But it moves beyond Australia to expose Chinese influence operations in the United States and Europe. The Chinese might reasonably complain that a book like this overlooks their need to defend themselves against an onslaught of subversive Western culture and anti-China rhetoric. The trouble, as Hamilton and Ohlberg show, is that Chinese influence and Western influence work rather differently. Whereas Western cultural influence is largely open and works by attraction, Chinese efforts are often corrupting or coercive. Wall Street firms, British banks, American and European university deans, Hollywood movie producers, and other Westerners pursue relations with Chinese partners in an uncoordinated way, on the basis of their immediate interests. But Chinese institutions work in a coordinated fashion under the guidance of the Chinese Communist Party’s United Front Work and Propaganda Departments, with long-term influence in mind. This well-substantiated account will add to the growing sense that China, in attempting to tell its side of the story, has gone too far in using methods unacceptable to the West."
39,China: The Bubble That Never Pops,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2020-10-13/china-bubble-never-pops,China: The Bubble That Never Pops,"For years, pessimists have expected the Chinese economy to collapse under the load of debt that built up as the government pumped out money to soften the impact of the 2008 financial crisis. To get out of that hole, Beijing ordered state banks to lend to inefficient state enterprises, let local governments meet unfunded government mandates with borrowed funds, and sat by as real estate developers borrowed cash to build unneeded housing blocks. More recently, the government has taken similar actions to get the economy growing again after the COVID-19 shock earlier this year, again fostering concerns that it has taken on too much debt. As Orlik skillfully explains, however, the government may manage its way out of its economic problems this time, just as it has done before. China benefits from a high savings rate, the limited convertibility of the renminbi, smart policymakers, and the government’s power to tell banks and firms what to do. China still faces plenty of risks, but Orlik warns against counting on financial troubles to derail its ambitions."
40,Two Books on the Chinese State,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/two-books-chinese-state,Two Books on the Chinese State,"These empirically rich and methodologically sophisticated books explore two among the many kinds of negotiated interactions between citizens and the state that contribute to China’s economic and political vitality. Hou describes how private entrepreneurs protect themselves from having to make involuntary philanthropic donations and avoid paying arbitrary fees, fines, taxes, and outright bribes by seeking office in local people’s congresses. As representatives, they gain social prestige and cultivate relationships with senior officials, which deters lower-level officials from hassling them. The congresses have no real legislative function, but they serve the important political purpose of fostering cooperative relations between government officials and some of the most prominent people in local society."
41,Three Books on Asian Political Leaders,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2020-10-13/three-books-asian-political-leaders,Three Books on Asian Political Leaders,"Three fascinating political biographies illustrate why it is so hard for even the most skillful leaders to carry out fundamental reforms in their societies. The Bhutto Dynasty is a complex Shakespearean tale of family loyalty and feuding, insecurity and arrogance, jealousy and solidarity. The Bhuttos’ story is filled with dramatic contradictions that span three generations. It revolves around Sir Shahnawaz Bhutto, a Sindhi landowner and leader involved in South Asian politics from the 1920s until his death in 1957; his son Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, who served as Pakistan’s president and prime minister in the 1970s; Zulfikar’s daughter Benazir Bhutto, who served twice as prime minister in the 1980s and 1990s; and her husband, Asif Ali Zardari, who was president from 2008 to 2013. They were feudal landholders with leftist politics, westernized elites with anticolonial attitudes, secular Muslims in a religious country, and a family that produced a rare female head of government from a lineage of playboy patriarchs. They were at once cynical and opportunistic in their political maneuvers and able to court and find martyrdom. Zulfikar was hanged after a military coup in 1979. Benazir was assassinated in 2007 by the Pakistani Taliban—probably with the connivance of the security forces—while running for a third term in office. It is hard to imagine a more intimate portrait both of the family and of Pakistani politics than this riveting narrative."
42,Wine Economics,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2020-10-13/wine-economics,Wine Economics,"Drinkers in China, Russia, the United States, and elsewhere appreciate fine wine as one of European culture’s great gifts to the world. Yet in recent decades, wine production has become a truly global industry, pitting producers of wine (fine and not so fine) nearly everywhere against one another in what this author calls a “wine war”—a ruthless battle to establish brand recognition and grab market share. Castriota, an Italian economist who doubles as a certified sommelier, offers the best introduction to the economics of wine currently available. Many factors, from cultural predispositions to the climate, shape the supply of and demand for wine and the profitability of the firms that make it. Various types of producers, from California conglomerates to Tuscan family farms, have found ways to prosper in the global wine economy. In the end, however, the most important factor determining success appears to be government regulation. In many countries, particularly within the European Union, tax advantages, classification systems, and trademark protection help keep production profitable, and states even directly subsidize small producers."

In this “Fordist” model, very large and specialized factories employing relatively well-paid workers efficiently produce an abundance of consumer goods. This method—combined with the Great Depression—sharpened global competition among democratic capitalist, fascist, and communist political systems, each trying to employ Fordist means of production to achieve different ends. This book traces the calculated way in which Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union studied the success of Fordism in the United States as at once a model of modernization to emulate and an ideological threat to fight. Later, in the Cold War, newly moderate Western Europeans came to view the United States as a potential partner, not just in the ideological crusade against communism but also in realizing Ford’s vision of an affluent, mass-production-focused society. This period’s lessons resonate today as new technologies threaten to disrupt production systems once again."
44,Ruin and Renewal: Civilizing Europe After World War II,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/ruin-and-renewal-civilizing-europe-after-world-war-ii,Ruin and Renewal: Civilizing Europe After World War II,"For Europeans, the end of World War II—“zero hour” (Stunde Null), the Germans called it—was a new beginning. Many historians have told the story of how European countries, ravaged by war, depression, and tyranny, were transformed after 1945 into models of tolerance and concern for their citizens’ welfare. Most such histories, notably the works of the late historian Tony Judt, stress the consolidation of democracy, the rebuilding of economic production, the construction of the welfare state, and the integration of Europe. Betts argues instead that what Europe really did was reconstruct a civilization: a set of basic secular and religious values that Europeans share. In this account, the postwar period marked the moment when Europeans discovered—or perhaps rediscovered—humanitarianism, universal human rights, ecumenical Christianity, the appreciation of diverse cultures, a respect for science, and a broadly accessible consumer culture. At times, one wishes for more depth and subtlety, as well as more attention to the often dark ways in which colonialism, anticommunism, and simple wealth accumulation actually drove the process. Yet this book succeeds in casting new light on a critical European legacy of liberal and moderate values, one that may again be in danger today."

Bochum, a German political researcher, argues that the future dangers posed by the Alternative for Germany (AfD) demand serious attention. But it is hard to see why. In this slim volume, she reports that other parties perpetually exclude the AfD from participating in the German federal government. Brexit has been such an embarrassment that extreme-right parties of reasonable size in Germany—including the AfD—no longer advocate leaving the EU. The AfD’s other policy aims have met with equally little success, except, at first glance, the imposition of greater restrictions on immigration. Yet even there, Bochum might have added, these measures passed not because of extreme-right pressure but because most Germans favor strict controls on immigration. Riven by factionalism and scandals, the AfD is now, in the author’s words, “self-destructing.” It may be admirable to sound the alarm about the rise of the far right in Germany, but is it still necessary?"
46,World in Danger: Germany and Europe in an Uncertain Time,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/world-danger-germany-and-europe-uncertain-time,World in Danger: Germany and Europe in an Uncertain Time,"As a former German ambassador to the United States and the current head of the Munich Security Conference, Ischinger has earned a reputation as a prudent diplomat and a card-carrying member of the post–Cold War global establishment. Yet this book, from its first page (which cites COVID-19 as the greatest international security threat since World War II) to its last (which cites climate change as the major security threat of the future), distinguishes itself as an uncommonly original, thoughtful, and forward-looking analysis of world politics. It represents the view not from Beijing, Moscow, or Washington but from Berlin. Today, with Brazil, India, the United Kingdom, and the United States running off the rails, France often contributing more style than substance, Japan remaining insular, and China and Russia tightening their authoritarian rule, Germany is the only major country that consistently articulates and often acts on a genuinely progressive vision of global multilateral order. German leaders view many policies adopted by today’s great powers as shortsighted, overmilitarized, and dangerously ideological—even if their country’s unique history obliges them to speak softly on such matters. They are convinced that regional integration, patient diplomacy, economic assistance, trade agreements, international law, democracy promotion, and other nonmilitary tools of statecraft can make the world a better place. No clearer statement of this pragmatically optimistic outlook can be found than the one elaborated in this important book."

Ikenberry argues that liberal internationalism is in fact a pragmatic political project whose core purpose has always been to promote a cooperative world in which free societies can defend themselves and address shared problems. He traces the tradition’s rich intellectual and diplomatic history, from its Enlightenment origins to its troubled path in the twenty-first century, identifying its enduring elements of open trade, international law and institutions, cooperative security, and progressive social aspirations. Liberal internationalism appears to be on the ropes today, pummeled by populists who reject globalization, nationalists who demand untrammeled sovereignty, and geopolitical rivals (led by China) who peddle competing global models. Many saw the 2016 election of U.S. President Donald Trump as a knockout blow. Appearances, however, can be deceiving. As Ikenberry reminds us, the liberal world order has suffered crises in the past, which challenged its champions to reimagine how a new world order might be constructed. In each case, they rose to the occasion. This book is a fitting capstone to an enviable career—although surely not Ikenberry’s last word on the subject."

H. Carr famously argued in The Twenty Years’ Crisis that Western peacemakers at Versailles built the post–World War I order on utopian illusions and liberal aspirations that led two decades later to economic upheaval, authoritarian nationalism, and great-power war. In this lively polemic, Cunliffe contends that in the aftermath of the Cold War, the United States and other democratic states did it again. Like liberal internationalists in U.S. President Woodrow Wilson’s era, post–Cold War liberal thinkers misdiagnosed the global moment, overestimating the historical forces moving the world in a liberal democratic direction while failing to appreciate the forces of nationalism, mercantilism, and imperialism. Cunliffe asserts that this “liberal utopianism” pervades the thinking of Western political elites. Whereas Carr identified the fiction of a “harmony of interests” as the core premise of Wilson-era utopianism, today the liberal illusion is a belief in the “infinitely expanding market” as the foundation of a universal liberal world order. Cunliffe spends very little time looking for interesting world-historical parallels between the two eras and focuses instead on the blind spots of intellectuals and academic thinking. The book will inspire a useful debate."
49,Two Books on the Liberal International Order,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2020-10-13/two-books-liberal-international-order,Two Books on the Liberal International Order,"Can the U.S.-led liberal international order be saved—and should it? These two books offer sharply opposing views. Bringing the contrarian sensibilities of a classical realist to the debate, Porter argues that the liberal order never really was all that liberal, and that it is an exercise in nostalgia to long for a post-Trump return to the imagined golden era of the postwar decades of American primacy. In Porter’s narrative, the postwar order was built more on old-fashioned coercion—and, at times, the brutal exercise of power—than on benign and enlightened U.S. leadership and cooperative rule-making. Porter sees military interventionism, covert action, and hegemonic bullying as a feature and not a flaw of the liberal order. In his view, the United States has rarely let rules and principles get in the way of the pursuit of its expansive geopolitical interests; the 2003 invasion of Iraq offers a particularly searing case in point. The danger of liberal internationalist thinking, Porter explains, is that it gets the United States in trouble by inspiring idealistic crusades to remake the world. He ends his book worrying about China’s revisionist challenges to the Western world. Ironically, a vigorous response to the rise of China would surely entail building on, rather than dismissing, the U.S.-led postwar coalition of democracies and multilateral frameworks of cooperation."

Yet as Lee shows in this pathbreaking book, in countries as diverse as Afghanistan, Indonesia, and Ukraine, large swaths of territory remain outside the state’s reach. Lee’s book provides the best study yet of how these ungoverned spaces have become important in international conflict. Powerful states engage in “foreign subversion” against their weaker rivals, often employing proxy forces such as provincial warlords or nonstate militias. These proxy groups attack representatives of the state in outlying areas, create rival administrative structures, and win the loyalty of locals at the expense of the national government. In this way, the aggressor state avoids the costs and risks of an overt war. Russia’s unofficial intervention in the Donbas region of Ukraine in 2014 is an iconic recent case of foreign subversion. But Lee also looks at other instances, including Malaysia’s subversive campaign against the Philippines in the late 1960s and 1970s and Thailand’s subversion of Vietnamese-occupied Cambodia in the 1980s. The book challenges one of the oldest insights in world politics, derived from the European state-building experience: that international conflict tends to strengthen the state."

The United States and like-minded countries were at the cutting edge of technological development. Policymakers were pointing to the inherently liberalizing effect of the Internet, which seemed a threat to dictators everywhere. The United States’ technological advantage made its military more potent, its economy more prosperous, and its democracy, at least in theory, more vibrant."

In 1986, the historian John Lewis Gaddis termed the post–World War II era a “Long Peace” because the Soviet Union and the United States had not come to blows. A few years later, the political scientist John Mueller suggested that changing norms had made great-power conflict obsolete. By 2011, the psychologist Steven Pinker was arguing that the Long Peace had morphed into a “New Peace,” marked by a generalized decrease of violence in human affairs."

Sanctions will slow Iran’s nuclear program. Travel bans will limit the spread of COVID-19. These claims all posit a causal relationship between means and ends. Regardless of party, ideology, or motive, no policymaker wants his or her recommended course of action to produce unanticipated consequences. This makes every policymaker a forecaster. But forecasting is difficult, particularly when it comes to geopolitics—a domain in which the rules of the game are poorly understood, information is invariably incomplete, and expertise often confers surprisingly little advantage in predicting future events."

The goal was to unfreeze credit markets and get the global economy working again. But instead of supporting the real economy—the part that involves the production of actual goods and services—the bulk of the aid ended up in the financial sector. Governments bailed out the big investment banks that had directly contributed to the crisis, and when the economy got going again, it was those companies that reaped the rewards of the recovery. Taxpayers, for their part, were left with a global economy that was just as broken, unequal, and carbon-intensive as before. “Never let a good crisis go to waste,” goes a popular policymaking maxim. But that is exactly what happened."

One of us grew up amid hardship and segregation in the Deep South, the first in her family to graduate from high school, a Black woman joining a profession that was still very male and very pale. The other was the product of an itinerant military childhood that took his family from one end of the United States to the other, with a dozen moves and three high schools by the time he was 17."

0,Sudan: Darfur and the Failure of an African State,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2011-05-01/sudan-darfur-and-failure-african-state,Sudan: Darfur and the Failure of an African State,"The great merit of this history of Sudan since independence is Cockett's skill at integrating the crises in southern Sudan and Darfur with the politics of Khartoum. Each of the rebellions against central rule, he explains, is a product of growing resentment over the centralization of political power in a narrow part of the country around the capital. Much of the book is devoted to the crisis in Darfur, and Cockett discusses both the complex web of racial and ethnic aspects and the elite personal conflicts that shaped the collapse of the province. Examining the international dimensions of the conflict, he finds that the Sudanese government's cooperation with American and British intelligence after 9/11 led the U.S. and British governments to ""go soft"" on Khartoum regarding the deteriorating situation in Darfur. It was only once the massive ethnic cleansing started that U.S. and British policy changed."

Godwin's harrowing account of events at the peak of the political violence in 2008 fits most neatly within the dominant narrative of events. A somewhat less autobiographical sequel to his 2006 memoir, When a Crocodile Eats the Sun, his new book examines the violent crackdown Mugabe engaged in after his ruling party, the Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF), lost the elections to the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) in March 2008. Godwin recounts gruesome stories of MDC stalwarts being beaten, tortured, and killed by the regime's goons, in the context of a country that has collapsed both economically and morally. Although Zimbabwe's small white minority features prominently in the book, it is less about race than about the horrors of arbitrary and cruel authoritarian rule and the attempts by courageous men and women to promote democracy and the rule of law."
2,Dancing in the Glory of Monsters: The Collapse of the Congo and the Great War of Africa,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2011-05-01/dancing-glory-monsters-collapse-congo-and-great-war-africa,Dancing in the Glory of Monsters: The Collapse of the Congo and the Great War of Africa,"Stearns' readable account of the ongoing war in the Democratic Republic of the Congo lacks the sweeping historical detail of Gérard Prunier's Africa's World War or the careful examination of the underlying ethnocultural sources of the conflict of René Lemarchand's The Dynamics of Violence in Central Africa. Stearns is more concerned with the perceptions, motivations, and actions of an eclectic mix of actors in the conflict -- from a Tutsi warlord who engaged in massive human rights violations to a Hutu activist turned refugee living in the camps and forests of eastern Congo. He tells their stories with a judicious mix of empathy and distance, linking them to a broader narrative of a two-decade-long conflict that has involved a dozen countries and claimed six million victims. Although everyone agrees that the war was initiated by Rwandan President Paul Kagame's regime in the wake of the 1994 Rwandan genocide, observers tend to disagree about how much blame should be placed on Rwanda for the crimes against humanity that have characterized the conflict that continues to fester in northeastern Congo. Stearns is among those who believe that violence against civilians has been a consistent policy on the part of the Rwandan regime and its agents."
3,The Perils of Proximity: China-Japan Security Relations,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2011-05-01/perils-proximity-china-japan-security-relations,The Perils of Proximity: China-Japan Security Relations,"The scholar-diplomat Bush argues cogently that China will ""widen its Eastern strategic buffer"" -- in the East China Sea and on the islands (Taiwan and the Senkaku Islands) located therein. In doing so, it will alter the status quo and increase the likelihood of a clash between the Chinese military and the Japanese forces already there. Through a close analysis of the institutions that govern each nation's military, he documents an even larger problem: that neither country is well equipped to deal with the consequences. He expects sclerotic collective leadership and multiple debilities in the countries' respective political and military systems to conspire with the security dilemma to turn clash into crisis. Along the way, Bush identifies dangers that have largely escaped notice, such as the capabilities of China's ""independent cyber militias,"" which exist beyond state policy, and the uncoordinated command-and-control systems and ""dysfunctional intelligence communities"" in both countries. His sobering, but not unduly inflated, analysis ends by mapping Washington's frustrations with both countries. Scholars will find leads for further research, analysts will find insights into the moving parts of East Asia's security community, and policymakers will find evenhanded guidance for how to manage the revival of China as a great power."

But Radnitz argues that this was not a case of civil society rising up spontaneously to overthrow an authoritarian elite. Instead, elites on the outs with the ruling group mobilized their clients at the village level in a process he labels ""subversive clientelism."" They replaced one corrupt regime with what turned out to be another, which, in turn, was upended by new protests in 2010. Ironically, the groundwork for this revolution was laid by the relatively liberal political and economic reforms of the first post-Soviet Kyrgyz regime, which allowed independent elites to strike roots in the villages. In neighboring Uzbekistan under President Islam Karimov, Radnitz writes, a more statist regime left no room for autonomous elites. When popular protests occurred there -- most notably in 2005 -- they remained localized and failed to overthrow the government."
5,Cambodia's Curse: The Modern History of a Troubled Land,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2011-05-01/cambodias-curse-modern-history-troubled-land,Cambodia’s Curse: The Modern History of a Troubled Land,"Brinkley cuts a clear narrative path through the bewildering, cynical politics and violent social life of one of the world's most brutalized and hard-up countries. Years of foreign aid, the well-meaning hectoring of diplomats and nongovernmental organizations, and several rounds of elections have done nothing to reform the lawless scramble for self-interest that permeates Cambodia's government from top to bottom. Brinkley's chief villain is the dictator Hun Sen, who has fixed elections and assassinated challengers since he came to power in 1985. But the author has equal contempt for Hun Sen's rivals -- among them, the former king Norodom Sihanouk and the pro-American reformer Sam Rainsy -- and for the foreign idealists who have repeatedly accepted Cambodian politicians' promises of improvement in exchange for billions of dollars in largely misused aid. Brinkley finds the roots of the Cambodian tragedy in a historical tradition of abusive dictatorship, the psychological wounds of the Khmer Rouge's genocide, and a geostrategic position that is just important enough to draw Western aid but not important enough to attract the political capital required to make the aid work."
6,The Making of Northeast Asia,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2011-05-01/making-northeast-asia,The Making of Northeast Asia,"Countering the prevailing view of Northeast Asia as constantly in crisis, Calder and Ye document the region's intensifying economic, cultural, and human interactions; its expanding financial and environmental interdependencies; and its growing policy coordination, especially among China, Japan, and South Korea. Cultural conflicts focused on Japan are fading into the background, tensions between Taiwan and mainland China have cooled, multilateral policy dialogues and other transnational institutions are becoming more common, and visionaries have proposed new transportation and energy links. Most analysts focus on how crises involving North Korea, Taiwan, or various territorial disputes could derail regional relations, but these authors focus on integrative forces that they think are quieter but more powerful: the economic pulling power of China, the cross-border interests of businesses, and the ambitions of political leaders to gain more independence from the United States."
7,Advantage: How American Innovation Can Overcome the Asian Challenge,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2011-05-01/advantage-how-american-innovation-can-overcome-asian-challenge,Advantage: How American Innovation Can Overcome the Asian Challenge,"Segal, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, believes that there is no way to stop the forces of globalization from diffusing high technology to rising U.S. competitors such as China and India. But he thinks the United States can maintain its dominance by innovating faster than technology leaks out. Unlike China or India, the United States benefits from low levels of government interference in business, a culture of risk taking, freedom of information, robust intellectual property rights -- and the very openness to the world that makes technology so hard to control in the first place. Segal believes the United States should invest more in education and infrastructure, do more to promote innovation, and smooth out counterproductive kinks in the legal system. The analysis aims to be encouraging. But it is hard to take much comfort from such a challenging prescription."
8,Harmony and War: Confucian Culture and Chinese Power Politics,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2011-05-01/harmony-and-war-confucian-culture-and-chinese-power-politics,Harmony and War: Confucian Culture and Chinese Power Politics,"Does Chinese strategic culture emphasize harmony and defense, thereby assuring that China's rise will be peaceful? Or is the culture realist, encouraging China to push its interests harder as its capabilities increase? Wang's thesis is that China has a strategic culture that is predominantly peaceful and defensive but that this culture has little influence over the country's grand strategy. He tests the thesis with a rich historical account of China's international actions from 960 to 1644, showing that the Song and Ming dynasties alternated between defensive and offensive behavior depending on the balance of power with neighboring political units. The theoretical implication is that China, like other states, shapes its strategy in response to the balance of material power. The practical implication is that China's behavior will continue to emphasize defense so long as it is weaker than the United States but will become more assertive if the opportunity arises."

Less well known are the dramas behind the reconfiguration of physical space, the staging of public celebrations, and the redesign of graphic arts. Hung's meticulous research reveals the struggles over values and power behind the granite surface of revolutionary China's new look. City planners fought over how big and what shape to make Tiananmen Square. Beijing icons such as the Great Hall of the People, the big museums, and the railway station were built in haste and with constant tinkering. Displays at what was then the Museum of the Chinese Revolution had to be revised to give enough prominence to Mao. A famous oil painting was altered four times as some of the leaders portrayed in it were purged and then rehabilitated. One failure was the party's attempt to replace charming New Year's prints of gods and fat babies with socialist realist pictures of labor heroes and political leaders: the book's illustrations make it easy to understand why the peasants were not interested."
10,Inside the Red Box: North Korea's Post-Totalitarian Politics,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2011-05-01/inside-red-box-north-koreas-post-totalitarian-politics,Inside the Red Box: North Korea’s Post-Totalitarian Politics,"McEachern is a U.S. Foreign Service officer based in Seoul who analyzes Pyongyang policymaking. Instead of the usual view of a one-man decision-making process, he proposes a ""post-totalitarian institutionalist"" model in which three bureaucratic actors with different views -- the party, the military, and the cabinet -- compete to shape the information and options available to Kim Jong Il and the ways in which his decisions are implemented. The approach helps explain many of the contradictions and oscillations of North Korean policy. The different positions of the three bureaucracies arise from their distinctive missions -- the party's, to protect its ideological vision; the military's, to defend state security; and the cabinet's, to promote economic survival. All elites, meanwhile, share an interest in the survival of their dysfunctional regime. Even the most pragmatic institution, the cabinet, is unwilling to trade away nuclear weapons in the face of what it sees as an existential threat from the United States. There are no real soft-liners."
11,What Is a Palestinian State Worth?,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2011-05-01/what-palestinian-state-worth,What Is a Palestinian State Worth?,"Nusseibeh, president of Al-Quds University, in Jerusalem, and a scion of an eminent Palestinian Muslim family, has long championed a peaceful settlement between Israel and the Palestinians. Here, he probes how the Israelis and the Palestinians can reach that goal. His optimal solution would be two states, but he fears that may no longer be feasible. A single state granting citizenship to all living in Israel and in those Palestinian territories that Israel conquered in 1967 seems equally unlikely. So Nusseibeh advances the idea of a single state run by the Israelis that offers the Palestinians civil and human rights but no political rights. ""Simply put,"" he writes, ""in this scenario the Jews could run the country while the Arabs could at last enjoy living in it."" This striking proposal grows out of Nusseibeh's political philosophy. He recognizes the fears and hopes of the Israelis as well as the Palestinians, stresses the morality and practicality of nonviolence, and views the state not as an end in itself but as a means to the good life. This idea of a ""second-class citizenship"" for Palestinians, he adds, could perhaps be just an ""interim step."" One can appreciate Nusseibeh's laudable effort to get beyond a seemingly endless occupation and fruitless negotiations, but his stark proposal is a nonstarter. Perhaps, however, this proposal and the other painstakingly reasoned arguments in this book will provoke the parties to reconsider that ideal but elusive two-state solution."

Not so. This is the work of a historian not so much pleading a case as bringing to life the mindsets and interactions of Arabs and Americans while highlighting the less well-known Arab side of the story. Telling that history requires touching on subjects usually filed in other historical folders. Makdisi neatly weaves a number of them -- Arab immigration to the United States, U.S. missionaries in the Middle East, the oil company Aramco, U.S. universities in the Arab world -- into a more conventional history of Washington's diplomacy in the region. He does indeed argue that U.S. support for Israel has strongly shaped U.S.-Arab relations, and that is in itself a useful corrective, given the tendency in many quarters to discount that factor.

Pakistan's political parties, he says, are best understood in terms of their different provincial roots, and each of the four major provinces offers a different culture. Islam in Pakistan, meanwhile, is about more than the Sunni-Shiite split, involving a complexity of contending movements. Lieven devotes an entire chapter to the Pakistani military, whose roots in the British Raj (1858-1947) he delineates. All this makes for a state that offers both limited services to and limited rule over society. In many areas, tribal or feudal customs provide the substance of governance, and along the 1,600-mile Durand Line, separating Pakistan from Afghanistan, the pretense of Pakistani sovereignty veils a de facto regional autonomy. In this system, the Pakistani Taliban will be resisted only as they thrust out from beyond their thinly populated border area. The Pakistani Taliban jihad, provoked by the U.S.-led campaign in Afghanistan, will subside only after a Western withdrawal from Afghanistan. Thereafter, Lieven warns, there should be ""no more wars against Muslim states under any circumstances whatsoever."""
14,Egypt on the Brink: From Nasser to Mubarak,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2011-05-01/egypt-brink-nasser-mubarak,Egypt on the Brink: From Nasser to Mubarak,"Published a short time before thousands of Egyptians began pouring into Cairo's Tahrir Square, Egypt on the Brink is a timely account of Egypt near the end of the 30-year Mubarak era. It is presented thematically, rather than chronologically, and one of the most intriguing themes is the notion that whereas Egypt in the age of liberal nationalism (the 1920s and 1930s) and the Nasser years (1952-70) had a regional standing and a sense of national purpose, Hosni Mubarak's regime lost both this standing and this purpose as it devolved into a dreary despotism. Yet Osman writes with neither nostalgia nor disdain. Separate chapters discuss the Islamists, the Christians, the rise of liberal capitalism, and Egypt's youth. Even the conclusion, which speculates on who and what regime would replace Mubarak, now overtaken by events, offers useful thoughts on Egypt's distinctive politics."

Drakulic's book is a little like David Sedaris' Squirrel Seeks Chipmunk as serious history. A mouse, a parrot, and a string of other creatures each tell a story about one of the Eastern European states. The parrot describes Yugoslav President Marshal Tito's life on the Brijuni Islands; the cat, Polish President Wojciech Jaruzelski's agonized reflections on his 1981 decision to crush Solidarity; the mole, the events surrounding the fall of the Berlin Wall; the pig, the effects of the Hungarian ruler János Kádár's ""goulash communism""; and so on. Drakulic is not trying to present the entire communist experience. Rather, she means to let a few apparently random, if significant, facets -- embellished by sardonic fictionalized observations -- give readers a sense of the foibles, fears, and absurdities of life back then."
16,The Kirov Murder and Soviet History,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2011-05-01/kirov-murder-and-soviet-history,The Kirov Murder and Soviet History,"On December 1, 1934, a disaffected, psychotic party worker stalked Sergei Kirov, the first secretary of the Leningrad Communist Party, as he walked the hall to his third-floor office and shot him in the back of the head. From this act flowed an ever-widening cascade of murderous events. Stalin charged Grigory Zinoviev and Lev Kamenev, once leaders of the opposition against him, with ""moral complicity"" in Kirov's killing. He then spread the blame to much of the Leningrad party organization and eventually, as the Communist Party's purge swelled, to all manner of supposed opposition figures, including so-called Trotskyite terrorists. In mainstream Western historical scholarship, Kirov's murder has long been thought to have been plotted by Stalin. In a post-Soviet Russia fascinated with more titillating theories, some have alleged that the assassin's motive was that of a jealous husband. Lenoe's massive volume combines biography -- of both Kirov and his killer, Leonid Nikolaev -- with an assessment of the vast documentation yielded by the Soviet archives, and it concludes that Nikolaev most likely acted on his own. As the documents and witnesses tell their story, the monstrous use that Stalin made of the event stands still more baldly exposed.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."
17,Lost and Found in Russia: Lives in a Post-Soviet Landscape,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2011-05-01/lost-and-found-russia-lives-post-soviet-landscape,Lost and Found in Russia: Lives in a Post-Soviet Landscape,"There are other excellent recent travelogues about Russia's deep, remote interior -- for example, Ian Frazier's Travels in Siberia and Anna Reid's The Shaman's Coat -- but Richards' book is different in two ways. First, she returned to the same places every year or two from the collapse of the Soviet Union to 2008, allowing her to gauge and color the picture of how the upheaval and confusion evolved over the intervening years. The color is gray, sometimes black, with eventually a bright splash of success here and there. Second, the core of her account revolves around deepening relationships with a half dozen individuals and couples mostly in Saratov and a godforsaken neighboring town named, yes, Marx. The ups and downs of their lives and their relationships with Richards mirrored the fate of much of the country. Richards' odyssey grew out of curiosity about the government's plans to create a modern homeland for the Volga Germans, ethnic Germans expelled by Stalin from the lands their eighteenth-century immigrant ancestors had settled, a prospect that soon withered. From there, she wandered into the world of Russian mysticism, traveling first to a community of Old Believers (Russian Orthodox traditionalists) deep in the forests of eastern Siberia and then to an odd, secretive Uzbek city obsessed with creatures from outer space. Eventually, she visited a scientific enterprise at the Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences that, taking its inspiration from nineteenth-century Russian scientist-philosophers, is seeking to merge a spiritual cosmos with hard science."

On the contrary, given the impact that GDP statistics have on politics and policy choices -- sometimes including international politics -- how these are measured and reported has immense practical consequences. During the Soviet era, Russia and its neighbors used completely different metrics from those of the United Nations System of National Accounts (SNA), which from the 1950s onward slowly became the international standard. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Goskomstat -- the old Soviet-era statistical agency, staffed with bureaucrats for whom the SNA was anathema -- abruptly and thoroughly discarded its old system of accounting. How and why? Herrera believes that the old guard's bifurcated sense of norms (the SNA was for market-based economies; their system, for a command economy) was key. Once one economic order replaced another, so, logically, should one bookkeeping system replace another. This leads Herrera to make a much larger point concerning the way norms influence institutions and institutions influence norms. This she does deftly, adding convincing complexity to standard theory."

Murphy does deal with this subset of Chechen women, but his angels comprise all categories of Chechen women -- on whichever side of the violence. Indeed, the first and second Chechen wars imposed all manner of cruelty on the women of the region: they were wounded or killed by indiscriminate bombing and shelling, kidnapped for ransom, tortured as suspected terrorists (by Russians), murdered as suspected collaborators (by Chechens), robbed, raped, burned out of their homes, and targeted in honor killings. Yet they also stood up -- sometimes as furious packs descending on those who had seized an innocent person, at other times in small nongovernmental organizations struggling to focus attention on human rights abuses. In smaller, more lethal numbers, they have also fought back as so-called white stockings, female snipers whose ranks include even a few non-Chechen biathletes, who joined the cause out of sympathy or for money. Murphy describes all these women in mind-numbing detail, one personal story after another, and with stomach-turning precision."

Building on this insight, a fascinating new field of study, anthropometric history, is demonstrating that extreme economic inequalities are reflected in the differing physical statures of social classes. In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, for example, well-fed European aristocrats towered over their undernourished peasants. This volume reveals that even today, a shockingly high percentage of impoverished Guatemalans suffer from stunted growth, whereas Mayan immigrant children living in California grow significantly taller -- suggesting that poverty, not genetics, is stunting their relatives back home. This innovative collection offers numerous surprises for conventional historians: in various periods when the urban poor were presumed to have suffered from economic austerity or authoritarian deprivation, for instance, anthropometry cannot find signs of worsening nutrition. The good news is that as a region, Latin America displays the lowest percentage of stunted growth in the developing world and has registered a dramatic drop, from 26 percent in 1980 to 13 percent in 2000."

Essentially a reprint of that consulting report, this primer, loaded with clear snapshots of cutting-edge cases, focuses on five countries: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, and Mexico. Overall, Salamon finds that leading Latin American firms are adapting modern practices of corporate social responsibility -- aligning their philanthropy with their business goals, forming partnerships with government entities and nongovernmental organizations, and including local communities in business decisions. Yet corporate participation is still spotty and too often focused more on public relations than on meaningful reform. Nonetheless, Salamon is ""cautiously optimistic"" that corporate social engagement is more than a passing fad."

Crandall, in contrast, took the time to interview U.S. policymakers and career diplomats. Her discovery: the mainstream complaint that the United States has forever neglected Brazil is way off the mark. In fact, U.S. officials -- at both the senior and the middle levels of the bureaucracy -- have recognized Brazil's relative weight and have repeatedly sought to engage its Foreign Ministry. But hung up on fears of being overwhelmed by U.S. power, or driven by their own dreams of Brazilian hegemony over South America, Brazilian diplomats have often turned their backs on U.S. advances. In this well-researched and balanced treatment, Crandall foresees the potential for bilateral cooperation on emerging global issues, ranging from financial stability to energy supplies, on which U.S. and Brazilian interests may converge. But will Brazil sufficiently redefine its strategic posture to pick up these gains?"

Chávez gained power not because of neoliberal market reforms and political decay but rather because of the reverse: Venezuela's statist, oil-based economy and prior democratic openings had created the conditions for Chavismo. Especially insightful -- and heartbreaking -- is the story of how Chávez has drained the once proud state oil company of capital to fund his politically driven social programs and ambitious foreign policy agenda. Equally fascinating is how he has cleverly manipulated his international largess and appeal to the region's radical left to mute external criticism of his rule. Most likely, the authors predict, Chávez will sustain his increasingly entrenched neopopulist regime, unless a more unified opposition can build bridges to regime moderates who fear future chaos. This masterful monograph's dissection of Chávez's astoundingly shrewd political tactics will be carefully studied by both his well-wishers and his detractors."

With purposeful transparency, Hendrix reveals the trail of money and technical assistance that flowed from U.S.-based nongovernmental organizations to Nicaraguans fighting for fair elections, integrity in government, a more effective judiciary, and a vibrant civil society. In his energetic efforts, Hendrix mobilized the impressive network of democracy-promotion specialists that USAID has nurtured around the Western Hemisphere. Hendrix adamantly rejects charges of interventionism and insists that his motives were not ""right versus left"" but rather ""right versus wrong."" On election day, Nicaraguan voters preferred one of the ""wrong"" candidates, awarding the United States' nemesis Daniel Ortega a slim plurality. Yet Nicaragua remains a vigorous, if imperfect, democracy, a work in progress that should give Hendrix some comfort."

This book is different. It is not just a sociocultural critique but also a personal memoir by an Indian-born, British-raised research psychologist and journalist who has toiled in the trenches of the culture wars. Although Malik is a socialist and has no time for anti-immigrant polemics, he criticizes the British government's policy of fostering independent multicultural communities. This policy has empowered fundamentalist clerics by naming them official spokespeople for Muslim communities that are, in fact, divided and moderate. He presents an intriguing explanation of how radical Islam has taken hold in the United Kingdom, based on the saga of how Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's 1989 fatwa against Salman Rushdie for his book The Satanic Verses -- originally just an opportunistic effort for Khomeini to gain a political advantage in Iran -- managed to spark fundamentalist religious confrontation and, ultimately, jihadist terrorism. Malik believes the causes of extremism do not lie in religious tradition: most radicals are neither religious nor traditional. Nor do they lie in hostility toward Western foreign policy, about which most British Muslim radicals care relatively little. He views the sort of jihadism that led to the July 7, 2005, bombings in London as a form of youthful rebellion, akin to membership in street gangs or middle-class slumming. It is motivated by young men's antipathy toward their parents and their desire for street credibility -- forces stronger among the better educated. The tragic result has been an increasingly illiberal and divided society, with little cultural space for second-generation British Muslims."

Seeley was right that the United Kingdom's empire was neither planned nor coherent. Yet nonetheless it was, as the title of this book suggests, a ""project,"" resulting from the deliberate, largely self-interested choices of British decision-makers. It also required, to a surprising extent, the cooperation of elites and masses in the territories that composed it -- without which, British power and wealth alone would surely have been insufficient. Oxford University's Darwin offers a brilliant modern synthesis of the project's history. The guiding theme is the rise and fall of the United Kingdom's power and wealth -- resulting from geopolitical forces over which the British had little control. He is particularly good on the empire's ineluctable but slow decline, arguing that only in the midst of World War II did it become clear that the nineteenth-century conception of empire was finished. Yet in telling the story of a great power's inevitable trajectory, Darwin does not neglect history's humanistic, less predictable side: the United Kingdom's clever diplomacy, the remarkable ethnic solidarity felt by the descendants of settlers, the role of imperial romanticism among both the conquerors and the conquered, and the extraordinary individual personalities behind the scenes. This long yet readable book is now the best general history of the British Empire."
27,Genocide and the Europeans,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2011-05-01/genocide-and-europeans,Genocide and the Europeans,"In world politics, idealistic schemes often begin with high hopes and end with disappointment. Such has been the case with Europe's response to recent genocides. So, also, is the experience of this book's author in applying trendy social science to this issue. Smith sets out to vindicate so-called constructivist theories of international relations, in the form of the proposition that international law alters the ideals, identities, and norms to which states adhere. The Genocide Convention, she conjectures, may encourage states to combat massive violations of human rights, and if any government in the world takes human rights seriously, surely it must be those in Europe. But after examining the official responses of France, Germany, and the United Kingdom to crises in Bosnia, Kosovo, Rwanda, and Darfur -- or, more often, their nonresponses -- Smith becomes more skeptical. Governments do tailor their actions to their public rhetoric. Yet Paris, Berlin, and London, just like Washington, also respond by recalibrating their rhetoric to duck responsibility, choosing whether to define events as ""genocide"" depending on their interests. The German government has been the most likely to use the term, in large part because it knows its smaller military is unlikely to be called on to intervene. France and the United Kingdom have been less likely to do so, because they might be obliged to deploy their more robust military forces. The result is perverse: Europe remains divided, self-interested, and cautious, even in the face of the worst atrocities. As François de La Rochefoucauld wrote, ""Hypocrisy is the homage that vice pays to virtue."""
28,The Spanish Republic and Civil War,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2011-05-01/spanish-republic-and-civil-war,The Spanish Republic and Civil War,"More than 25,000 books and essays have appeared on the Spanish Civil War, and almost 75 years later, still no consensus has emerged about its causes, course, and consequences. In part, this is because historians still cannot resist taking sides in what was the quintessential battle among twentieth-century political ideas. Nearly every important organized ideology of that century was represented. Fascists, monarchists, Catholics, nationalists, liberals, anticlericalists, Socialists, Communists, and anarchists all took part. After the assassinations, terrorism, and mass killing spread, the Nazis, the Italian Fascists, and the Soviets intervened, while the British and the French appeased. The war ended with the Republicans' unconditional surrender to General Francisco Franco and led to a half century of repression. Few have contributed more to understanding these events than Casanova, an eminent professor at the University of Zaragoza. Here, he synthesizes new research, much of it by a generation of young historians, into a lively, engaging account -- the best available in English."

The same factors drive cycles in financial journalism. Immediately after the European Union and the International Monetary Fund bailed out troubled European governments in May 2010, when the reporting for this book ends, many were still predicting disaster for the eurozone. Lynn, a journalist, captures the conventional wisdom behind that pessimism. The euro, he says, was always motivated primarily by politics, not economics; the Germans accepted it only as a quid pro quo for reunification, even though it does not really benefit them. He believes that the debt contagion is likely to spread to Italy, Spain, and Portugal; that eventually the euro must collapse; and that Europe's and the United States' power have irrevocably shifted to Asia. But observers have grown more optimistic since Lynn wrote his book. The Europeans have redoubled their efforts to stabilize the system, because it is in their economic interest to do so. The French and the Germans are bailing out their banks, and the Greeks are working toward a restructuring or a partial default. Bust gives a sensible midterm report on the euro crisis, but the final chapter has yet to be written."

Kieser understands as few others do just how important Protestant missionaries in the Ottoman Empire in the first two decades of the twentieth century were to American progressive intellectuals and religious leaders. His description of the gulf of mutual misunderstanding that separated Ottoman and American Protestant reformers is haunting. And his analysis of how those reformers lost hope after the mass murder of Armenians during World War I is revelatory. (U.S. missionaries had seen the Armenians as the modernizers of the Middle East, and their near extinction dealt a blow to the missionaries' fusion of Enlightenment optimism and Protestant Christianity.) Unfortunately, Kieser does not have the same familiarity with Arab sources that he does with Ottoman ones; his nearest East really includes only Asia Minor. And like many writers with strong theological and moral commitments, he sometimes piles a very high mountain of moral judgment on very shaky foundations of political analysis. Nevertheless, at its best, Nearest East casts fresh light on an episode that left lasting marks on the United States' culture and its relations with a vital part of the world."
31,The South and America Since World War II,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2011-05-01/south-and-america-world-war-ii,The South and America Since World War II,"This masterful history of the American South since World War II analyzes the social and economic transformation of a region that within living memory was still William Faulkner territory. In 60 years, the Jim Crow laws have fallen and much of the region has been through both industrialization and (as textile mills fled to Asia) deindustrialization. The country's most rural region has become suburban and metropolitan; domestic migrants and immigrants are changing the South's demography and culture at an unprecedented rate. The most Democratic region of the country has become the most Republican; the South has more weight in Congress today than at any time since the Civil War. Yet the region remains the country's most distinct and problematic. Cobb, one of the South's leading historians, has produced a clear and compelling portrait of a tumultuous time, using race relations, economic development, and culture as three lenses through which to understand the contemporary South and its future. A look at how underdevelopment has both restricted the South's choices and shaped its culture would have made the book even more useful; at times, Cobb seems to be scolding the South rather than explaining it. But the South does not always make perverse choices because of some flaw in its nature; frequently (as with its hunger to attract low-wage and environmentally destructive industries), it is trying to make the best of a bad situation."
32,The Dogs of War: 1861,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2011-05-01/dogs-war-1861,The Dogs of War: 1861,"As the United States lurched toward civil war 150 years ago, the political leaders in both the North and the South, Thomas writes in this concise book, were profoundly ignorant of their true situation. Abraham Lincoln was perhaps the most deluded of them all; both his words and his deeds were predicated on the belief that only a handful of hotheaded aristocrats really cared about the Confederacy and that the silent majority of moderate Southerners would return to the Union once passions had cooled. Jefferson Davis had a clearer idea that the war might be long and bitter, but he believed -- and would continue to believe into 1865 -- that the South could fight a successful guerrilla war against the North. Neither president knew how to use military leaders effectively in 1861. In Thomas' view, Davis never quite understood that Robert E. Lee believed that the South's only path to victory lay in destroying the North's army on the field of battle. And although Lincoln's chief military officer (the aged War of 1812 veteran Winfield Scott) thought from the beginning in terms of a long and bitter war, Lincoln rejected his advice as unpalatable."

When the French Revolution failed to create a moderate and liberal republic, when the newly independent South American republics collapsed into chaos, and when decolonization created fragile new states around the world, American intellectuals and policymakers argued about what modernization is and how it can be promoted. Latham's review grasps the strategic importance of modernization theory to U.S. foreign policy and at times offers penetrating and useful analysis. He does an excellent job of showing how Americans' technocratic assumptions have caused problems when events in places such as Egypt under Gamal Abdel Nasser, India under Jawaharlal Nehru, and Iraq more recently have not worked out as hoped. But Latham is sometimes more eager to castigate past administrations than to understand the dilemmas they faced. Nobody really knows how modernization really works, where history is headed, or how to raise living standards in poor countries. Yet the United States' values and interests lead the country, over and over, to promote what it hopes will be positive changes around the world."

He challenged all aspects of the orthodox view. This view, he argued, underplayed the viciousness of the North Vietnamese Communists, the genuine concerns of other countries in the region about the implications for them should South Vietnam collapse, and the fact that with a little less timidity, the Communists could have been beaten. If instead of overthrowing the South Vietnamese leader Ngo Dinh Diem, the Americans had worked on taking the battle to the North, the war would now be viewed in a quite different light. Hence the title of his book, Triumph Forsaken. In Triumph Revisited, Wiest and Doidge have collected Moyar's critics (and there are many) to explain why the standard explanations for the United States' failure in Vietnam -- its exaggerated Cold War fears, its hopeless client, and its incoherent strategy -- remain compelling. Moyar is allowed a spirited defense. The collection demonstrates the importance of debate as a way of illuminating important issues and questioning established positions."
35,The Age of Airpower,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2011-05-01/age-airpower,The Age of Airpower,"A new book from Van Creveld is always something to be savored. There have been many previous histories of airpower, but none so comprehensive and sensitive to context as this one. No recorded use of aircraft in war has been excluded, whether during the 1939-40 Russo-Finish War or the El Salvador insurgency in the early 1990s. Even fictional accounts of air war are included. In some ways, the book is a masterpiece of compression. Yet the result can be dense, and at times, Van Creveld's sources are not the best. The underlying argument, moreover, is unconvincing. The basic thesis is that airpower had reached its country-wrecking peak by 1945, after which it declined, as nuclear deterrence suppressed great-power war and as the arrival of missiles, satellites, and drones rendered increasingly expensive aircraft superfluous. As Van Creveld points out, airpower has not been effective in ""wars among the people,"" and the air forces of the major powers have all shrunk since their glory days. But so, of course, have their navies and their armored divisions; the real argument to be made is about the declining utility of all types of military power. Van Creveld is right to be aware of the limits of airpower used on its own, but few commanders would wish to fight their land wars without air superiority."

Keeney's book is not so much about LeMay as about the extraordinary system he created to ensure that the United States could threaten the Soviet Union with nuclear retaliation under all circumstances. Keeney cites LeMay's views in 1950 about what would be needed to allow the United States to deliver a retaliatory strike rather than just a first strike: an intelligence system that would warn of an incoming attack, a continual war footing for the air force, sufficient funds to support ambitious operational planning, and, in LeMay's words, the need to ""re-examine present policies which imply that we must absorb the first blow."" If retaliation was the order, then everything revolved around the 15 minutes of Keeney's title -- the time it would take to get strategic bombers airborne while giving the president time to decide whether to exchange nuclear devastation. This strategy explains the massive size of the U.S. arsenal, which at its peak comprised some 34,000 nuclear weapons. The justification for all this is that it worked: mutual deterrence took hold, and the Cold War ended peacefully. But accidents and potentially catastrophic errors were regular. Along with David Hoffman's The Dead Hand, Keeney's book is yet another chilling reminder of the enormous gamble of Cold War deterrence."

But they are especially exciting when they occur outside the United Kingdom and the United States, since they are much less common in other countries. Around the world, resistance to such takeovers is gradually crumbling, although at markedly different rates. Culpepper, a political scientist, tries to explain why this is so, focusing on public policy in France, Germany, Japan, and the Netherlands. Whereas France and Japan have seen a significant decline since 1990 in the proportion of corporate equity held by ""stable"" shareholders (that is, shareholders that are unlikely to sell to an upstart buyer), Germany and the Netherlands have not. The change in stable shareholding, Culpepper argues, is not so much a cause as a consequence of shifting attitudes toward management. So long as the issue of corporate control remains politically unimportant, national policy will largely be determined by the preferences of companies' managers, rather than by those of institutional investors, workers, or even politicians. But if the issue develops political salience -- as it did in the United States after the Enron scandal or, more recently, in reaction to the high pay for executives at bailed-out banks -- management sometimes, but not always, loses control of the issue."

Eichengreen, an economic historian, has written a brief and readable account of how the international monetary system got where it is today and of past efforts, both successful and (mainly) unsuccessful, to reform it. He argues that the dollar is deeply embedded in the world economy and that it will be difficult for any alternative -- the euro, the yuan, or the International Monetary Fund's reserve asset, Special Drawing Rights -- to dislodge it anytime soon. The dollar continues to be attractive because of the size of the U.S. economy and the scale and liquidity of U.S. financial markets and, above all, because many foreign firms and governments continue to use it. Eichengreen also skillfully debunks the notion that the Chinese government could damage the United States by dumping its large holdings of dollars and the view that the United States' geopolitical influence hinges on the international role of the dollar. In fact, any serious damage to the United States' role in the world is likely to be done by Americans' own inattention to fiscal discipline.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

Restrictions on international capital movements are back in fashion. In this useful overview, Cline reviews the extensive and scattered economic literature on the contribution of financial openness to economic growth, correcting the mistaken impression that the literature provides little support for it. The results of many studies are overwhelmingly one-sided in showing that financial openness encourages growth -- it has boosted the GDPs of the emerging countries by 0.5 percent a year since 1990, Cline estimates, and it has boosted those of the rich countries by even more. The cumulative gains of opening up to foreign capital outweigh the losses attributable to occasional financial crises (as opposed to global recessions, which hurt countries largely by reducing trade)."

Over the last year, crises of confidence have hit the 17 EU members that in the years since 1998 have given up their own currencies to adopt the euro. For the first decade of this century, markets behaved as though the debt of peripheral EU countries, such as Greece and Ireland, was as safe as that of core EU countries, such as Germany. But when bond investors realized that Greece had been cooking its books and that Ireland's fiscal posture was unsustainable, they ran for the door. The EU has stopped the contagion from spreading -- for now -- by creating the European Financial Stability Facility, which can issue bonds and raise money to help eurozone states. Together with the International Monetary Fund, the European Financial Stability Facility has already lent Greece and Ireland enough money to cover their short-term needs."

Twenty-six vignettes tackle diverse questions: Where does the reader fit into the global distribution of income? How unequal was income in the Roman Empire? Who was the world's richest person in history? How egalitarian was socialism in practice? Is there an emerging global middle class? How does the search for love and wealth in Pride and Prejudice differ from that in Anna Karenina? A growing volume of data on income distribution within countries and new data on purchasing power comparisons between countries have permitted the author, an economist at the World Bank, to make quantitative generalizations that could once only be guessed at. It is a pity he did not include (in an appendix) some of the data he draws on so skillfully."

The same might be said for theories of international relations after they make contact with the real world. In this collection of essays, leading diplomatic historians and international relations theorists explore the limits of realist theory in explaining why great powers do what they do. Although their critiques are not new -- indeed, scholars spent the two decades after the appearance of Kenneth Waltz's Theory of International Politics in 1979 debating the explanatory claims of the balance of power -- this book does illuminate how great powers' ideologies, domestic politics, and shifting power relationships shape their behavior. The authors all focus on historical moments when major states defied the expectations of balance-of-power theory, failing to respond to rising threats, pursuing appeasement, or going overboard. Paul Schroeder finds realism's balancing logic insufficient to explain patterns of conflict in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Niall Ferguson examines German foreign policy during the Munich crisis. May, one of the volume's editors, explores the ""underuse"" of military power. The book is not really a devastating indictment of realism -- after all, the authors all use realism as a base line from which to identify the other factors at work. But it does show the fruitfulness of exploring the interplay between history and theory."

In recent years, this ""third wave"" of world democratization has slowed and, in some cases, reversed. This important book presents fascinating empirical findings that explain why some countries have become democracies and others have not, and why some democratic breakthroughs have endured and others have slid backward. Echoing the classic work of the political scientist Adam Przeworski, Teorell argues that modernization primarily helps prevent reversals to authoritarianism rather than promote transitions to democracy. Interestingly, he suggests that this ""modernization effect"" has to do with the spread of media: a free press seems to undercut antidemocratic coups. Short-term economic gains, meanwhile, can reinforce authoritarian rule, whereas sudden economic crises can trigger pro-democracy movements. Teorell also finds evidence of a ""diffusion effect,"" whereby a successful democratic transition in one state can stimulate efforts elsewhere. The book's rich findings will no doubt stir the scholarly debate and lend support to democracy promoters who wish to strengthen pro-democratic groups and independent media.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

The International Politics of Great Power Peace,"Not since World War II have any major countries directly fought a war with one another -- the longest period of great-power peace in centuries. Scholars have debated the sources and significance of this ""long peace,"" variously pointing to nuclear deterrence, democratization, and economic interdependence. All these explanations look to long-term shifts in the costs of war and the benefits of peace. In this book, Fettweis goes a step further and argues that a deeper transformation has occurred in the way citizens of great powers think about large-scale war. He asserts that there has been a long-term shift in the norms of war, not unlike earlier shifts in norms that undermined the acceptability of dueling and slavery. Much of the book is focused on the implications for theories of international relations. Unfortunately, Fettweis spends very little time actually looking for empirical indications of evolving norms. It may well be that today's great-power peace reflects a discontinuity in the normative underpinnings of international politics. But skeptics who read this book will probably remain skeptics."

The optimistic post-Cold War era, when globalization, democracy, and U.S. leadership seemed to be lifting all boats and bringing the world together, is over. Rachman unfurls his narrative in a sequence of brief portraits of political leaders and public intellectuals -- such as Deng Xiaoping, Ronald Reagan, and Bill Gates -- who are emblematic of various features of the rapidly transforming global landscape. The book points to the obvious problems that are unsettling the global system, including climate change, nuclear proliferation, failed states, and the failure of institutions such as the G-20 to foster cooperation and manage geoeconomic instability. As Rachman writes, these problems might be more tractable if the United States were still sufficiently dominant to impose solutions, but the shift of power and wealth toward Asia and the rise of a rival Chinese authoritarian capitalist system are undermining the coherence and stability of the current world order. Taking the long view, however, it is far from clear that world politics are, as he believes, more zero-sum now than in the past."

(A second volume will take the story to the present.) Drawing inspiration from Samuel Huntington's classic study Political Order in Changing Societies, Fukuyama begins with humans' earliest steps to construct tribal societies before moving on to the gradual emergence of organized political communities and the rise of the territorial state. At each turn in this rich survey, he is interested in the origins and evolution of political institutions, whether they be Arab, African, Chinese, European, or Indian. Political development, he argues, is manifest in societies' gradual, contested, and reversible transitions toward the modern state, where authority is centralized, the rule of law holds sway, and representative leaders are held accountable. The book incorporates both traditional accounts of the rise of the state, emphasizing war and economic predation, as well as those that focus on transformative ideas about law, justice, and religion."

This is hardly surprising. The policymakers responsible for developing homeland security policy in the wake of September 11, 2001, did so under extraordinary conditions and with few guideposts. The Bush administration's emphasis on combating terrorism overseas meant that it devoted limited strategic attention to the top-down law enforcement and border-focused efforts of the federal departments and agencies assigned new homeland security responsibilities. President Barack Obama has largely continued his predecessor's policies, and congressional oversight has been haphazard. As a result, nearly a decade after al Qaeda struck the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, Washington still lacks a coherent strategy for harnessing the nation's best assets for managing risks to the homeland -- civil society and the private sector."
53,Getting the Military Out of Pakistani Politics,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/south-asia/2011-04-15/getting-military-out-pakistani-politics,Getting the Military Out of Pakistani Politics,"The United States has a major stake in Pakistan's stability, given the country's central role in the U.S.-led effort to, in U.S. President Barack Obama's words, ""disrupt, dismantle, and defeat"" al Qaeda; its war-prone rivalry with India over Kashmir; and its nuclear arsenal. As a result, U.S. policy toward Pakistan has been dominated by concerns for its stability -- providing the reasoning for Washington's backing of the Pakistani military's frequent interventions in domestic politics -- at the expense of its democratic institutions. But as the recent eruption of protests in the Middle East against U.S.-backed tyrants has shown, authoritarian stability is not always a winning bet."
54,The Black Swan of Cairo,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/egypt/2011-06-01/black-swan-cairo,The Black Swan of Cairo,"Why is surprise the permanent condition of the U.S. political and economic elite? In 2007-8, when the global ﬁnancial system imploded, the cry that no one could have seen this coming was heard everywhere, despite the existence of numerous analyses showing that a crisis was unavoidable. It is no surprise that one hears precisely the same response today regarding the current turmoil in the Middle East. The critical issue in both cases is the artiﬁcial suppression of volatility -- the ups and downs of life -- in the name of stability. It is both misguided and dangerous to push unobserved risks further into the statistical tails of the probability distribution of outcomes and allow these high-impact, low-probability ""tail risks"" to disappear from policymakers' ﬁelds of observation. What the world is witnessing in Tunisia, Egypt, and Libya is simply what happens when highly constrained systems explode."
55,What Is Totalitarian Art?,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/review-essay/2011-04-14/what-totalitarian-art,What Is Totalitarian Art?,"Earlier this year, the government of Iraq, in a misconceived act of outreach to the country's once dominant Sunni community, began restoring a dilapidated monument in Baghdad. Originally constructed in the late 1980s as a celebration of Iraq's supposed triumph in its war against Iran, the Victory Arch was partially dismantled in 2008 by Sadrist elements who were eventually stopped by orders from the Iraqi prime minister. The monument consists of two sets of giant forearms and hands brandishing swords, draped with a net containing a gruesome collection of enemy helmets. Conceived by Saddam Hussein himself and carried out by the Iraqi sculptor Mohammed Ghani Hikmat using casts of Saddam's own arms, it is such an outstanding example of totalitarian kitsch that I used it as a lens through which to view the degradation of culture in Iraq under the Baathist regime in my 1991 book The Monument."
56,The Post-American Hemisphere,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/americas/2011-05-01/post-american-hemisphere,The Post-American Hemisphere,"On August 18, 2010, a Venezuelan drug trafficker named Walid Makled was arrested in Colombia. U.S. officials accused him of shipping ten tons of cocaine a month to the United States, and they made a formal extradition request to try him in New York. Although the Venezuelan government had also made an extradition request for crimes Makled allegedly committed in Venezuela, senior U.S. diplomats were confident that the Colombian government would add him to the list of hundreds of suspects it had already turned over to U.S. judicial authorities in recent years."
57,The Future of the Liberal World Order,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/future-liberal-world-order,The Future of the Liberal World Order,"There is no longer any question: wealth and power are moving from the North and the West to the East and the South, and the old order dominated by the United States and Europe is giving way to one increasingly shared with non-Western rising states. But if the great wheel of power is turning, what kind of global political order will emerge in the aftermath?"
58,After Doha,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/world/after-doha,After Doha,"It is time for the international community to recognize that the Doha Round is doomed. Started in November 2001 as the ninth multilateral trade negotiation under the auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and its successor, the World Trade Organization (WTO), the talks have sought to promote economic growth and improve living standards across the globe -- especially in developing countries -- through trade liberalization and reforms. Yet after countless attempts to achieve a resolution, the talks have dragged on into their tenth year, with no end in sight."
59,Terrorism After the Revolutions,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/middle-east/2011-04-03/terrorism-after-revolutions,Terrorism After the Revolutions,"On December 17, Mohamed Bouazizi, a Tunisian street vendor, set himself on fire to protest police harassment. His death incited unrest throughout Tunisia; less than a month later, protests toppled Tunisian President Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali. Egypt, the most populous and inﬂuential country in the Arab world, soon followed suit. Al Qaeda met both these dramatic events with near silence. Only in mid-February did Osama bin Laden's Egyptian deputy, Ayman al-Zawahiri, officer comments. But even then, he did not directly address the revolutions or explain how jihadists should respond. Instead, he claimed that the Tunisian revolution occurred ""against the agent of America and France,"" gamely trying to transform Tunisians’ fight against corruption and repression into a victory for anti-Western jihadists. On Egypt, Zawahiri offered a rambling history lesson, ranging from Napoleon to the tyranny of the Mubarak government. He released his statement on Egypt on February 18, a week after Hosni Mubarak resigned, and offered little guidance to potential followers on how they should view the revolution or react to it."
60,The Rise of the Islamists,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/middle-east/2011-04-03/rise-islamists,The Rise of the Islamists,"For decades, U.S. policy toward the Middle East has been paralyzed by ""the Islamist dilemma""—how can the United States promote democracy in the region without risking bringing Islamists to power? Now, it seems, the United States no longer has a choice. Popular revolutions have swept U.S.-backed authoritarian regimes from power in Tunisia and Egypt and put Libya's on notice. If truly democratic governments form in their wake, they are likely to include signiﬁcant representation of mainstream Islamist groups. Like it or not, the United States will have to learn to live with political Islam."
61,The Heirs of Nasser,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/middle-east/2011-04-14/heirs-nasser,The Heirs of Nasser,"After a long absence, a strategic player has returned to the Middle Eastern stage: the people. In Tunisia, Algeria, Jordan, Yemen, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Syria, Bahrain, Iran, and Libya, protesters are demanding either comprehensive reform or total revolution. Only once before in modern history has a populist wave of this magnitude swept the region."
62,Understanding the Revolutions of 2011,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/middle-east/2011-04-14/understanding-revolutions-2011,Understanding the Revolutions of 2011,"The wave of revolutions sweeping the Middle East bears a striking resemblance to previous political earthquakes. As in Europe in 1848, rising food prices and high unemployment have fueled popular protests from Morocco to Oman. As in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union in 1989, frustration with closed, corrupt, and unresponsive political systems has led to defections among elites and the fall of once powerful regimes in Tunisia, Egypt, and perhaps Libya. Yet 1848 and 1989 are not the right analogies for this past winter's events. The revolutions of 1848 sought to overturn traditional monarchies, and those in 1989 were aimed at toppling communist governments. The revolutions of 2011 are fighting something quite different: ""sultanistic"" dictatorships. Although such regimes often appear unshakable, they are actually highly vulnerable, because the very strategies they use to stay in power make them brittle, not resilient. It is no coincidence that although popular protests have shaken much of the Middle East, the only revolutions to succeed so far—those in Tunisia and Egypt—have been against modern sultans."
63,Demystifying the Arab Spring,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/libya/2011-04-03/demystifying-arab-spring,Demystifying the Arab Spring,"In Tunisia, protesters escalated calls for the restoration of the country's suspended constitution. Meanwhile, Egyptians rose in revolt as strikes across the country brought daily life to a halt and toppled the government. In Libya, provincial leaders worked feverishly to strengthen their newly independent republic."
64,The Fall of the Pharaoh,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/middle-east/2011-06-01/fall-pharaoh,The Fall of the Pharaoh,"For almost 60 years, Egyptians have celebrated Revolution Day on July 23, to commemorate the day in 1952 when Gamal Abdel Nasser and the Free Officers overthrew the monarchy to establish a republic. Next year, the country will celebrate Revolution Day on January 25 -- the first day of the mass protests that forced Hosni Mubarak, the country's president for 30 years, from power."

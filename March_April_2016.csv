0,How to Survive Slow Growth,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/issue-packages/2016-02-15/how-survive-slow-growth,What’s Inside,"The first decade of the twenty-first century was a time of unprecedented economic growth. The rich world got richer, and the developing world raced ahead: by 2007, the emerging-market growth rate had hit 8.7 percent, and economists began to speak of “convergence,” when the impoverished “rest” would finally catch up to the West. Then came the fall. Today, with China slumping, energy prices collapsing, and nervous consumers sitting on their hands, growth has ground to a halt almost everywhere, and economists, investors, and ordinary citizens are starting to confront a grim new reality: the world is stuck in the slow lane and nobody seems to know what to do about it. How did we get here? How can we escape stagnation, and why aren’t the old remedies working? And what are the geopolitical implications of this new economic era? These are the questions this issue’s lead package tries to answer. Articles by Larry Summers and by J. Tomilson Hill and Ian Morris kick things off by explaining why, more than seven years after the Great Recession began, the recovery remains so weak. Summers looks at the causes and consequences of secular stagnation and finds a remedy in expansionary fiscal policy. Hill and Morris caution that the road ahead looks even rougher, as central banks have already used every tool at their disposal, leaving the global economy “without shock absorbers.” Ruchir Sharma fleshes out the origin story by highlighting a key problem that’s often overlooked: radical declines in population growth around the world. Nancy Birdsall warns that slow growth won’t just hurt businesses and investors; it could also end one of the most important developments of the last three decades: the steady rise of a global middle class, which has played an essential role in the spread of democracy and good governance. And Robert Kaplan explores the destabilizing effects of slow growth on China and Russia, two great but struggling powers that could soon become even more belligerent and unpredictable as their economies continue to sour. It’s not all bad news, however; Tyler Cowen, Zachary Karabell, and Ruth Porat all argue that it’s not yet time for despair. Reviewing Robert Gordon’s The Rise and Fall of American Growth, Cowen reminds us that predictions about growth are notoriously hard to get right and that breakthroughs, with all their attendant benefits, often arrive when least expected. Karabell argues that slow growth isn’t necessarily so hard to live with—at least not if costs are also stagnating, which they are. Ruth Porat, finally, brings us the view from Google (now Alphabet): a markedly sunnier take that emphasizes the ability of technology and innovation to empower and energize people and make the world a better place for everyone. Let’s hope she’s right."
1,"Genoa, “La Superba”: The Rise and Fall of a Merchant Pirate Superpower",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2016-02-16/genoa-la-superba-rise-and-fall-merchant-pirate-superpower,"Genoa, “La Superba”: The Rise and Fall of a Merchant Pirate Superpower","British expats have written so many books about Italian daily life that I habitually ignore them when selecting titles to review. Yet this one caught my eye. Most such books cover standard tourist spots or cute country houses, but this one profiles Genoa, a gritty port city that once held a privileged spot on the Grand Tour of the continent that was a rite of passage for wealthy Europeans from the mid-seventeenth to the mid-nineteenth century. Genoa now attracts few foreigners aside from those changing trains. Although the book is filled with the requisite stories about colorful locals, architectural monuments, and the unique cuisine served in neighborhood restaurants, it also dwells extensively on Genoa’s fascinating history. Even well-read Europhiles tend to forget about the bold Genoese, who held their own for centuries through trading and piracy and also supplied naval mercenaries to the world, notably John Cabot and Christopher Columbus. Walton’s description of the city’s past and present may convince readers, as it convinced me, to put Genoa on the itinerary of a future visit to Italy."
2,The New Intergovernmentalism: States and Supranational Actors in the Post-Maastricht Era,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2016-02-16/new-intergovernmentalism-states-and-supranational-actors-post,The New Intergovernmentalism: States and Supranational Actors in the Post-Maastricht Era,"Most scholarly literature on the EU gets mired in the weeds of technocratic policymaking or floats in the clouds of supranational institutions. So it is a pleasure to read a book that returns to the biggest historical puzzle posed by the evolution of European integration: How is it possible to have such intense and deepening cooperation (albeit with occasional failures) without strong, authoritative institutions of the type traditional nation-states possess? Europe continues to integrate in areas such as foreign policy, immigration, and internal security, without delegation to central authorities, but these authors do not wring their hands. Instead, they argue that the EU is not about “ever-closer union.” Rather, the default setting of the EU is informal consensual deliberation. This analysis is not new, and its plausibility rests on explaining away the powerful European Central Bank and on a blanket assertion that the EU is in disequilibrium and might change. Yet this book bears close reading as an effort to return theories of European integration to the debate about the EU’s future."
3,"Margaret Thatcher: At Her Zenith; In London, Washington, and Moscow",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2016-02-16/margaret-thatcher-her-zenith-london-washington-and-moscow,"Margaret Thatcher: At Her Zenith; In London, Washington, and Moscow","Moore is a Tory journalist who has been working on a definitive Margaret Thatcher biography for 18 years—with the third volume still to come. The first volume explored Thatcher the person; this second one looks more closely at Thatcher the politician, covering her time in office from 1979 through her third election, in 1987. At her best, she was energetic, committed, and courageous. She faced down striking coal miners, imposed privatization, reformed local government, and negotiated a British rebate from the EU. She was realistic, compromising on China’s demands regarding Hong Kong, the EU’s single-market initiative, the U.S. invasion of Grenada, and the conflict in Northern Ireland. She was visionary, seeing the Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev as a man with whom she could do business and, for better or worse, completely overhauling the British economy. And she was lucky, as every successful politician must be, waging and winning the Falklands War and thus transforming a prime ministership whose days seemed numbered into one of the postwar United Kingdom’s longest. In the end, however, she could not escape the fate of so many powerful leaders: the narrowing of vision, and ultimately paranoia, that comes from relying on ever-fewer close advisers."
4,The Merkel Republic: An Appraisal,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2016-02-16/merkel-republic-appraisal,The Merkel Republic: An Appraisal,"German Chancellor Angela Merkel dominates her country’s politics, has outlasted all competition as the longest-serving current head of government in Europe, and bestrides the globe as the world’s most powerful woman. Amid the hagiography, however, it is easy to forget that behind all successful politicians lie the sober electoral calculations and coalitions that keep them in power. On the surface, this collection of essays tells readers more than they likely want to know about the German parliamentary elections of 2013. Underneath, however, it reveals the fascinating intricacies and paradoxes of German political life. One learns why the German government is consistently headed by center-right parties even though most Germans vote for leftist ones, why more and more Germans throw their votes away on extremist parties, why Merkel favors a coalition with the opposition rather than ruling alone, why Germany can hold a national election that costs two percent of what an American one costs, why Germans disagree so much about the euro, and much more. Although uneven, the book is a must-read for those who seek to get behind the headlines about the chancellor."
5,"Europe’s Orphan: The Future of the Euro and the Politics of Debt; Between Debt and the Devil: Money, Credit, and Fixing Global Finance",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2016-02-16/europes-orphan-future-euro-and-politics-debt-between-debt-and,"Europe’s Orphan: The Future of the Euro and the Politics of Debt; Between Debt and the Devil: Money, Credit, and Fixing Global Finance","These two books, the first by a noted Financial Times commentator and the second by a former British business leader and financial regulator, challenge two pillars of conventional wisdom about Europe. First, they deny that the so-called euro crisis had anything to with the euro itself. Sandbu goes so far as to view the euro as a sound currency that even the British should adopt. Rather, they argue, the debt crisis resulted from the bad macroeconomic policy choices of eu member states, namely, a focus on fiscal austerity, high interest rates, and debt repayment. Second, both authors reject the view that the eu will need to establish a fiscal and economic union to fully recover. Rather, they claim, EU governments simply need to spend more, loosen their monetary policies, and restructure their debts. This would be good news for Europe, because the solution would be so simple, even pleasant, to implement. It would be bad news for utopian technocrats in Brussels, who for five years have tried to convince everyone that the only solution to the shortfalls of European federalism is more federalism."
6,"White World Order, Black Power Politics: The Birth of American International Relations",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/white-world-order-black-power-politics-birth-american-international-relations,"White World Order, Black Power Politics: The Birth of American International Relations","In this interesting and important yet flawed book, Vitalis seeks to bridge the “vast gulf divid[ing] international relations from Africana studies,” bringing the “racism [of the discipline of international relations] to light.” Conventional narratives of the field’s history, he argues, trace it to the rise of realism and national security concerns in the years around World War II, adding a few historical thinkers, such as Thucydides, to claim a timeless intellectual pedigree. But this ignores both the extensive mainstream scholarship of the first decades of the twentieth century that dealt with colonialism and racial issues and the pioneering work of African American writers in what he calls “the Howard School.” Consigning both to the memory hole, he says, paints a distorted picture of the discipline’s origins and nature, obscuring the role that international relations scholarship has played in the construction and perpetuation of white Western dominance."
7,"The Year of Indecision, 1946: A Tour Through the Crucible of Harry Truman’s America",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2016-02-16/year-indecision-1946-tour-through-crucible-harry-trumans-america,"The Year of Indecision, 1946: A Tour Through the Crucible of Harry Truman’s America","The year 1946 was an odd one, suspended between the end of World War II and the start of the Cold War. The U.S. economy was undergoing an uncertain transition away from the turbocharged prosperity of the war years, and it was not yet clear that the next generation would enjoy steadily rising living standards and the birth of an affluent society. The shock of the atom bomb was still new, China was not yet communist, and nobody really knew what the postwar era would bring. This is fertile terrain, but readers who do not already have a strong grasp of the events and chronology of this eventful year will be confused rather than enlightened by Weisbrode’s allusive and indirect approach to historical narrative. And readers well versed enough to follow Weisbrode’s musings hardly need to be reminded that 1946 was an important year. The book is thoroughly researched and thoughtful, but it is overloaded with ruminations and lacking in narrative clarity, ultimately failing to live up to the promise of its conceit."
8,Empire of Self: A Life of Gore Vidal,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2016-02-16/empire-self-life-gore-vidal,Empire of Self: A Life of Gore Vidal,"Through his historical fiction, his reviews, and his eloquent and acerbic essays on U.S. foreign policy, Gore Vidal became a prolific and widely read commentator on American life. Parini, a novelist who knew Vidal well, has written a lucid, bracing, and candid book that is likely to become the definitive Vidal biography. Vidal was a successful American who went to the Old World and scaled the heights of its social and literary worlds. But his ambitions went further; he hoped to be recognized as a major novelist and to become a significant political figure in the United States. Parini discounts Vidal’s political efforts; he ran for both the U.S. House of Representatives and the Senate but was never elected. Parini’s critical appraisal of Vidal’s novels seems just; the best of them are quite good, but none quite makes it to the first rank. But Parini is too kind to Vidal’s essays on U.S. foreign policy, which are attractively cynical and elegantly Jeffersonian in worldview but offer little to serious students of international affairs; despite their great wit and charm, they are unlikely to be consulted much in days to come."
9,Washington: A History of Our National City,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2016-02-16/washington-history-our-national-city,Washington: A History of Our National City,"Lewis’ history of Washington, D.C., identifies some important continuities that have marked life in the nation’s capital since its establishment in the 1790s. The first is the disparity between black and white. A center of the slave trade until the Compromise of 1850 abolished the trade (but not slavery itself) in the District of Columbia, Washington harbored slave pens, slave ships, and slave auction houses that horrified foreign visitors and inflamed northern politicians and journalists. The second continuity is the paradox that the citizens of the capital of the world’s oldest democracy lack genuine representation in Congress. The cost of that disenfranchisement has been high, in terms of both Congress’ often uncaring and sometimes racist stewardship of the district and the blighting of local political culture. Lewis is most successful when dealing with the early years of Washington’s history; the chapters on those years are authoritative and fresh. As the story approaches the present, however, the book becomes less convincing. Oddly, Lewis ends with a paean to the wonders of Washington’s subway system, apparently unaware of the low esteem in which most D.C. residents hold it."
10,The Power of the Past: History and Statecraft,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2016-02-16/power-past-history-and-statecraft,The Power of the Past: History and Statecraft,"A large and growing gap divides policymakers, who sometimes deal in crude and shopworn analogies (“another Munich,” “another Vietnam”), and professional historians, some of whom, as the historian Jill Lepore has lamented, believe that “looking to the past to explain the present falls outside the realm of serious historical study.” The historical profession, Brands, Suri, and their contributors argue in this strong and stimulating volume, should engage with the need of policymakers for useful knowledge, and policymakers should strive to develop the kind of “historical sensibility” that Suri finds in Henry Kissinger. The volume features a mix of younger scholars (Brands, Suri, Jennifer Miller, Michael Cotey Morgan) and senior figures such as Thomas Mahnken and James Steinberg. “The Nature of History’s Lessons,” the closing essay by Philip Zelikow, a historian who has also served in government, is a masterful overview of the subject that both policymakers and historians would do well to consult; it is a fitting conclusion to a book that deserves a close read."
11,"The Wilderness: Deep Inside the Republican Party’s Combative, Contentious, Chaotic Quest to Take Back the White House",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2016-02-16/wilderness-deep-inside-republican-partys-combative-contentious,"The Wilderness: Deep Inside the Republican Party’s Combative, Contentious, Chaotic Quest to Take Back the White House","Widely sourced and compellingly written, The Wilderness offers a rich and entertaining mix of gossip and political scheming as it follows one of the largest candidate fields in modern history through the early stages of the 2016 U.S. presidential race. But Coppins’ real subject is the state of the Republican Party, which was shaken to its core by President Barack Obama’s 2012 reelection and which is still riven by disagreement about the reasons for its defeat. Did the gop lose because it was too conservative? Because it was too out of touch with minorities and too tied to the demographics of the past? Or did it lose because its nominee, Mitt Romney, never offered a full-throated defense of conservative principles that would have motivated the party’s base? Coppins holds his readers’ interest by showing how the flood of 2016 gop candidates reflects a competition among prescriptions for a Republican recovery, as well as a battle among outsize egos. Coppins’ book reminds readers that democracy survives in the postmodern world in part because it is the most entertaining form of government. Americans may not agree on much, but they do seem to enjoy watching desperately ambitious candidates undergo the endless ordeal that U.S. presidential politics has become."
12,Agincourt,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2016-02-16/agincourt,Agincourt,"On the first page of her excellent book on the Battle of Agincourt, whose publication marked the battle’s 600th anniversary, Curry reminds readers that the encounter, at which English forces defeated a larger French contingent, was not actually decisive in determining the course of the Hundred Years’ War. Nevertheless, the battle has never left British popular imagination. Shakespeare made Agincourt the centerpiece of Henry V, surrounding the battle with noble language and oratory that live on today (“We few, we happy few, we band of brothers”). The emotional force of Shakespeare’s play was well captured in the film version starring Laurence Olivier, which reached cinemas just months after the 1944 Normandy landings. The battle’s legacy is not one-dimensional, however: although the British have long celebrated the skill of the humble English archers who struck down members of the French nobility at Agincourt, they also recall that Henry V rather less heroically ordered French prisoners of war to be killed. Throughout the book, Curry displays extraordinary command of the sources, from early written chronicles to recent archaeological research."
13,"The German War: A Nation Under Arms, 1939–1945",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2016-02-16/german-war-nation-under-arms-1939-1945,"The German War: A Nation Under Arms, 1939–1945","Why did the German people stick with the Nazis despite the terrible things that were being done in their name—even as defeat became ever more likely? That is one of the most puzzling questions of World War II, and in this enthralling book, Stargardt avoids simple answers. Not all Germans believed in Nazism (although he leaves no doubt that the fate of the Jews was common knowledge), nor were they all fooled by Nazi propaganda (although he offers fascinating insights on how Joseph Goebbels calibrated the Nazi Party’s messages to lift morale and deflect blame away from Hitler). Instead, Stargardt puts together a complex portrait of a nation gripped by patriotism and resentment, thrilled by early military victories, and proud of the fighting skills of the Wehrmacht. Germans blamed American Jews for food shortages and ferocious Allied bombing raids and wondered if such hardships were retribution for what the Nazis were doing to Europe’s Jews. As the Allies closed in, the loss of German life was horrific: Stargardt suggests that 10,000 Germans died every day, on average, during the first months of 1945. Yet until the very end, German teenagers still signed up to fight."
14,Shooting Up: A Short History of Drugs and War; Light It Up: The Marine Eye for Battle in the War for Iraq,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2016-02-16/shooting-short-history-drugs-and-war-light-it-marine-eye-battle,Shooting Up: A Short History of Drugs and War; Light It Up: The Marine Eye for Battle in the War for Iraq,"In his profound, troubling, and deeply informative book, Kamienski investigates the relationship between intoxicants and warfare. Military historians have long understood the role of alcohol as a source of “Dutch courage,” but Kamienski focuses on substances such as hashish, cocaine, and amphetamines, explaining their attraction for those in combat and the dark consequences of their habitual use. Drugs not only get soldiers in the mood to fight but also help them cope with the subsequent stress. The development of amphetamines in the first half of the twentieth century seemed to be an answer to the problems of fatigue and sleep deprivation in military forces; the drugs have proved especially appealing for aircrew members who need to stay awake and alert for long periods. With official approval and encouragement, the use of certain kinds of drugs has become widespread in militaries—and so, too, have addiction, sluggish and erratic behavior, and even hallucinations and paranoia. Kamienski’s rich study starts with ancient Greece but mostly examines events from the last few centuries, including the Opium Wars and the Vietnam War, which the author dubs “the first true pharmacological war.” He examines how Adolf Hitler, although a teetotaler and a vegetarian, became dependent on amphetamines; the challenge posed by drugged-up child soldiers in Sri Lanka; and the search for safe drugs to produce optimum performance in combat. The book concludes with a rumination on the addictive qualities of war itself."
15,From Silk to Silicon: The Story of Globalization Through Ten Extraordinary Lives,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2016-02-16/silk-silicon-story-globalization-through-ten-extraordinary-lives,From Silk to Silicon: The Story of Globalization Through Ten Extraordinary Lives,"Garten approaches globalization, which has occurred in fits and starts, through the biographies of ten people who powerfully shaped the process—sometimes inadvertently, and often driven by selfish motives. Among his subjects are Genghis Khan, John D. Rockefeller, Jean Monnet, Margaret Thatcher, and Deng Xiaoping. Each was determined and single-minded, if not monomaniacal, in pursuit of his or her objectives. Each displayed a great mastery of details and enjoyed an unusual skill for organizing people; they were doers, not just thinkers. It is impossible to know whether they genuinely altered the course of history, since impersonal forces might have produced similar effects. But they were first movers, and their stories and the immediate consequences of their actions are thoroughly engaging."
16,"How the Internet Became Commercial: Innovation, Privatization, and the Birth of a New Network",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2016-02-16/how-internet-became-commercial-innovation-privatization-and-birth,"How the Internet Became Commercial: Innovation, Privatization, and the Birth of a New Network","The Internet has revolutionized economies and societies much as electricity and the chemical industry did a century ago and the steam engine and railroads did nearly two centuries ago. How did it come about? Greenstein has crafted a detailed history of the Internet, which began as a U.S. Department of Defense project in the 1960s, later moved to the National Science Foundation, and was ultimately turned over to the private sector in the early 1990s. Two early strategic decisions encouraged tremendous innovation “at the edges,” as the author puts it: the use of the “packet switching protocol,” which allows networks to transmit massive amounts of data efficiently, and the development of the “end-to-end principle,” which dictates that critical Internet nodes transmit information without altering or controlling it—a development that would not have occurred if AT&T had continued to dominate U.S. telecommunications, as it did for decades prior to 1984, when the so-called Bell System was broken up. Some governments regret the resulting freewheeling nature of the Internet and wish to exercise greater control over it, which pits them against a large community of Internet providers, users, and activists who subscribe to a form of technological libertarianism."
17,Climate Change: What Everyone Needs to Know,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2016-02-16/climate-change-what-everyone-needs-know,Climate Change: What Everyone Needs to Know,"The international climate conference held in Paris last year created a conceptual framework for governments to address climate change and set an aspirational target: to limit the increase in the globe’s surface temperature to two degrees Celsius above that of the preindustrial era—which means an increase of less than one degree from the current level. Romm provides a useful primer on the drivers of climate change, the ways that the world might achieve that target, and the obstacles to moving away from business as usual. It draws on the latest scientific work, with its many remaining uncertainties, to assess the current situation and outlook and examines emerging “decarbonization” technologies for use in energy production and agriculture. The book’s tone is somewhat alarmist, but it is full of useful information and accessible analysis."
18,Of Limits and Growth: The Rise of Global Sustainable Development in the Twentieth Century,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2016-02-16/limits-and-growth-rise-global-sustainable-development-twentieth,Of Limits and Growth: The Rise of Global Sustainable Development in the Twentieth Century,"Nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) have long been important in shaping U.S. policy. They have become increasingly important around the world as well, joining business organizations as shapers of policy, especially but not only in democratic societies. This excellent contribution to contemporary political history skillfully documents the role of NGOs in pressing governments to pay more attention to the ecological and environmental consequences of their policies and to push for sustainable development. Such efforts have not been universally successful, as demonstrated by worsening air and water pollution in China and India and by continuing deforestation in South America. But NGOs have made major strides in influencing how aid agencies, international financial institutions, and the governments of some developing countries think about development and in holding them more accountable for the environmental effects of their actions."

In particular, according to this strain of thought, innovation and entrepreneurship thrive most when government gets out of the way. Mazzucato strongly challenges this view, arguing that the most important innovations of recent decades can virtually all be traced back to government support and often to government initiative. Specifically, the advancing frontiers of information technology, biotechnology, and energy have their origins in government-sponsored research and often in direct government investment. The same holds true for shale gas and electric automobiles, two innovations often praised as the fruits of private initiative. Mazzucato concedes that some government expenditures on innovation have been unproductive and even condemned as government waste by their critics. But that is hardly surprising, she counters: the absence of such mistakes would imply a lack of healthy risk taking. Mazzucato supports her thesis with numerous examples and case studies and argues persuasively that a successful, innovative society must draw on symbiotic partnerships between governmental and private entities."
20,Why Torture Doesn’t Work: The Neuroscience of Interrogation,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2016-02-16/why-torture-doesnt-work-neuroscience-interrogation,Why Torture Doesn’t Work: The Neuroscience of Interrogation,"Critics of the use of torture in interrogations have marshaled a sophisticated body of philosophical, ethical, and legal arguments to argue against the practice. This study puts all of that aside and asks the question, What does the science say? O’Mara, who is a professor of experimental brain research, concludes that torture simply is not effective as an interrogation tactic. The book takes readers on an extended tour of the brain and the way it functions under the “chronic, severe, and extreme stressor states” produced by forms of torture such as starvation, thirst, sleep deprivation, and waterboarding. O’Mara looks at the scientific literature examining the effects of these grim methods and determines that information obtained using them is inherently suspect. Meanwhile, people subjected to severe torture are likely to sustain permanent damage to their brains and psychological functioning. The last refuge in the defense of torture has always been an appeal to elevate pragmatism and security over ethics and the law in the face of a “ticking time bomb.” O’Mara’s book reveals the hollowness of that argument."

Yet Hobson’s sweeping narrative of the rise and spread of modern democracy provides a useful corrective to the unrealistic euphoria of the 1990s, when many saw the spread of democracy as an unstoppable force, and serves to dispel today’s unwarranted pessimism about democracy’s future. Hobson shows that World War I was the great turning point, as U.S. President Woodrow Wilson managed to frame the conflict as a fight to establish democracy as the global standard for legitimate political rule. The ideological stakes were even higher during World War II and the Cold War, which pitted liberal democratic ideals against fascist and communist alternatives. Struggles to create democratic governments were not just internal dramas; they played out on a global stage, where the rules and norms of the emerging international order were still up for grabs. Hobson’s emphasis on the contingent and contested spread of democracy contradicts idealists’ narratives about the triumph of democracy, but the book also reminds skeptics of democracy’s future of just how deeply entrenched democratic norms are in international society."
22,The Conceit of Humanitarian Intervention,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2016-02-16/conceit-humanitarian-intervention,The Conceit of Humanitarian Intervention,"In this contrarian book, Menon argues that the entire “project” of humanitarian intervention is deeply problematic. His critique is realist. Despite lots of talk about international norms and human rights, power and interests still drive world politics, he asserts. The United States and European countries waited three years before intervening in the Bosnian war, and they finally did so in part because NATO's credibility was on the line. And Western powers chose not to intervene at all as humanitarian disasters unfolded in Rwanda and Darfur, because they did not see their national interests at stake. Menon thinks that the idea of humanitarian intervention is best seen as an artifact of the United States’ post–Cold War unipolar moment, when Russia was in political free fall and China was only beginning its economic ascent. He claims that, in reality, no international community exists that could provide legitimacy to humanitarian interventions and argues that such interventions rarely work anyway; they often create chaos rather than stability. Despite his searching critique, Menon is nonetheless unwilling to argue that the world should simply turn a blind eye to genocide and mass killings. So he is left asking the same question that leads many liberals to support humanitarian intervention: How should the world respond in the face of mass killing and large-scale human suffering?"

Rising European power and influence reached a climax and created an early form of globalization. For better or worse, the West and the rest of the world discovered their interconnectedness. As Ogle notes in this fascinating account of the establishment of “global time,” an interconnected world required standard measures of time and space. Capitalism and a global economy demanded that large numbers of people organize and synchronize the prosaic stuff of a modern industrial life—production cycles, work schedules, delivery dates—across great distances. But Ogle is more interested in the ways in which the concept of global time helped create what she calls a “global imagination,” in which peoples and societies could be understood as parts of a single, developing world system. In this way, Ogle argues, the standardization of time reflected and reproduced the world’s European-led power hierarchies. International clocks and calendars united the world, but they also revealed and sometimes reinforced its inequities."
24,Why Leaders Fight,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2016-02-16/why-leaders-fight,Why Leaders Fight,"Leaders don’t get much attention from international relations scholars, who tend to favor abstract models and structural theories that discount the personalities or experiences of decision-makers. This important book brings state leaders back into debates about war and peace. Drawing on insights from historians and psychologists, the authors find interesting patterns in the attitudes of leaders toward risk and the use of force. The book’s major contribution is its massive data set, which includes 2,400 leaders from around the world over the last century. The authors argue that prior combat experience seems to dampen leaders’ enthusiasm for war. However, those leaders who served in the military but had no direct experience of combat have been among the most likely to initiate or escalate military conflict. Gender does not seem to matter, but age does: in democracies, young leaders are less likely to use military force than older ones—perhaps, the authors speculate, because older leaders fear they have less time to make their mark. The book also documents a positive correlation between having a troubled childhood and engaging in risk-prone behavior as an adult political leader."
25,Education and Empowered Citizenship in Mali,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2016-02-10/education-and-empowered-citizenship-mali,Education and Empowered Citizenship in Mali,"What should we expect from the dramatic increase in school enrollment across Africa in the last two decades? Through a nuanced analysis of Mali in comparative context, Bleck persuasively argues that schools can teach students the tools of political participation and allow parents to connect with the state. Carefully reviewing the effects of three types of Malian schools—public, private Francophone, and Islamic—she finds that all three increase political knowledge. Higher levels of education do not, however, increase one’s propensity to pursue “easy” forms of political participation, such as voting: when citizens doubt the state’s effectiveness, abstaining might become an educated person’s way of expressing discontent. But education does encourage more “difficult” forms of participation, such as contacting government representatives, volunteering on campaigns, and running for office. Still, doing those things often requires the ability to speak the official language, French. And since French is transmitted through public and private Francophone schools much more than through Islamic schools, which focus on teaching Arabic, Bleck suspects that Islamic students will face obstacles to political participation at the highest levels."
26,The Politics of African Industrial Policy: A Comparative Perspective,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2016-02-10/politics-african-industrial-policy-comparative-perspective,The Politics of African Industrial Policy: A Comparative Perspective,"This book amounts to an impassioned plea for African industrial policies built around a proactive and interventionist state, which the authors consider to be a prerequisite for successful development in Africa’s low-income economies. The aim would be to create export-oriented manufacturing sectors, like the ones that have lifted economies in East Asia. The book’s best chapters examine industrial policy in Ghana, Mozambique, Tanzania, and Uganda, places where the development of industrial subsectors has often been undermined by some combination of divisions within the elite, weakness in the private sector, and antidevelopment pressures on the government. But these accounts are surprisingly pessimistic about the ability of the four governments to carry out the policies the authors view as necessary. In their conclusion, the authors suggest more hopefully, if rather vaguely, that the right political conditions could emerge over time to enhance the prospects for the development strategies they espouse."

At first glance, the civil war in Sierra Leone in the 1990s seems to fit this pattern. Guerrilla groups such as the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) used the fighting to gain access to power and diamonds. But as Mitton persuasively argues, such theories fail to explain the acts of wanton and dehumanizing violence that rebels perpetrated, including the often coerced savagery of child soldiers. He advances psychological explanations, showing how feelings of shame and disgust motivated individual acts of violence. Mitton’s key insight is that by the middle of the civil war, the RUF was led by men who had been themselves brutalized and terrorized and were thus driven less by the organization’s initial strategies than by their various mental illnesses. Mitton has produced a useful addition to the burgeoning literature on civil wars, enriched by his detailed knowledge of the war in Sierra Leone and his numerous interviews with men who committed atrocities."

But it remains a poorly understood place. Prunier and Ficquet’s excellent collection of essays is thus welcome, and it provides a great introduction to the country’s people, history, and politics. Ethiopia’s Orthodox Christian roots stretch back to at least the fourth century, but today, more than a third of the population adheres to Islam, and the fastest-growing religions may well be the evangelical Protestant and Pentecostal denominations to which perhaps a fifth of the population now belongs. The book’s historical sections compellingly narrate Emperor Haile Selassie’s failed attempts at modernization and the disastrous revolution of 1974 that overthrew him and resulted in the Marxist regime of Mengistu Haile Mariam. Mengistu himself was deposed in 1991 by the guerilla leader Meles Zenawi, whose subsequent regime was characterized by more comprehensive and relatively successful attempts at modernization and economic development."

Yet as Prichard notes, the actual details of this bargain have rarely been carefully documented. This finely crafted book examines the politics of taxation in Ethiopia, Ghana, and Kenya and shows clearly that in each case, increases in taxation have indeed been accompanied by greater government accountability to citizens, although there were substantial differences in how this actually happened. Open public resistance to increased taxation in Ghana, for instance, put pressure on the government to link the taxes to specific improvements. In Ethiopia, in contrast, a long tradition of authoritarian rule reduced the scope of protests when the government levied new taxes. An array of other factors also shape tax bargaining, including the overall stability of the government, the fiscal pressures it faces, and the amount of influence exerted by the business community and civil society. Prichard’s fine book is aided by his analytic acumen and the richness of the empirical data he has gathered."

In a curious turn of events, over a decade later, refugees from the Somali civil war began to settle in Lewiston, Maine, a short distance from Colby College, where Besteman had become a professor of anthropology. Amazingly, a number of the refugees were from Banta, and Besteman was able to reconnect with them. This remarkable book is the product of that coincidence. It presents a vivid account of Somalis who survived their village’s collapse into ethnic violence and escaped by foot to Kenya, where they spent a decade in a dreadful refugee camp. Some were then lucky enough to be accepted for resettlement in the United States. Many of those were sent to Lewiston, where their attempts to make a new life were sometimes undermined by a careless U.S. bureaucracy, their own poverty and lack of education, and discomfort among locals grappling with the unexpected influx of several thousand illiterate Africans into their small New England town. Besteman eschews social science jargon to tell her story with great insight and empathy. Her book should be required reading for policymakers currently debating what to do with refugees from Syria."

But Basu, who was the chief economic adviser to the government of India under Prime Minister Manmohan Singh from 2009 to 2012 (and who is now chief economist of the World Bank), provides lucid discussions, suitable even for non-economists, of issues as varied as inflation management, taxes, and poverty alleviation. His main argument is that simplistic policies produce unintended consequences as market actors respond in their own ways to new incentives. But he argues that India in recent decades has gotten economic policy more right than wrong. The country’s initial “costly investment” in democracy has paid dividends by generating an inclusive policymaking process, which may be unwieldy but maintains social stability even in the midst of profound change. He believes that if Indian governments put a few more smart reforms in place, the country can enter a “high-growth path” that will continue for decades."

But as this collection of concise and authoritative essays shows, New Delhi has been unable to establish the close ties with its immediate neighbors that would provide a steppingstone for exerting significant influence farther away. Nor does it engage effectively with international institutions in the areas of trade, finance, arms control, or climate change. The country’s policymaking apparatus is dysfunctional. The foreign ministry is understaffed and works without significant oversight from political parties, parliament, the business community, media, or academia. The military lacks strategic direction from the civilian authorities, and its service branches barely coordinate with one another. The nuclear weapons program runs on autopilot, and the domestic arms agency has failed to produce high-end indigenous weapons. Covering all these topics, the book opens up many fascinating areas for future research."
33,Divided We Govern: Coalition Politics in Modern India,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2016-02-10/divided-we-govern-coalition-politics-modern-india,Divided We Govern: Coalition Politics in Modern India,"A secular, left-leaning “third force” has long struggled to cultivate the political space between the upper-caste-based Congress party, which ruled India for most of its history as an independent country, and the Hindu nationalist movement, whose party controls the government today. But the left has constantly splintered along ideological, caste, and regional lines. On the three occasions when it came to power, it ruled in coalition governments that held together for less than a full parliamentary term each. Ruparelia notes the achievements of the leftist-led governments but pays special attention to their factious politics, which he attributes partly to poor political judgment and partly to India’s “federal party system,” in which large, ethnolinguistically defined states spawn distinctive political subsystems that are shaped by local, rather than national, cleavages. His analysis explains the dynamics of the leftist coalitions but does not make clear how they differed from the other coalition governments that have led India since 1989, some of which did serve full terms."

Their view from below challenges the clichéd images of regimented masses fanatically loyal to the revolution. In reality, Chinese society under Mao was turbulent in many of the same ways it is today. The most interesting chapters in this volume describe young people trying but failing to internalize official ideology, local party cadres ignoring orders to ban community rituals, and millenarian religious sects and ethnic uprisings boiling under the surface of Maoist homogeneity. But these new insights do not contradict the established view that Mao’s regime exercised a terrifying degree of surveillance and control."
35,The Pakistan Paradox: Instability and Resilience,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2016-02-10/pakistan-paradox-instability-and-resilience,The Pakistan Paradox: Instability and Resilience,"Pakistan is torn by many forces: feuding ethnolinguistic groups, warring political parties dominated by the rival Bhutto and Sharif families, competing military and civilian power centers, and sectarian rifts. Jaffrelot describes this bewildering tangle in historical depth and forensic detail but also uncovers a central dynamic beneath it: the effort of an aristocratic Urdu-speaking landed elite to preserve its quasi-feudal social privileges. Members of this elite have exploited security threats from Afghanistan and India and relied on a version of Islamic orthodoxy to bolster their legitimacy while conducting round after round of power struggles among themselves. Their too-clever-by-half cultivation of jihadists as proxy warriors in Afghanistan and Kashmir, however, has fostered destabilizing domestic extremism that feeds on social discontent. Yet Jaffrelot finds the country paradoxically resilient: the very fractiousness of the political system hinders any radical departure from the status quo."

Muedini focuses on the political uses of Sufism in Algeria, Chechnya, Morocco, Pakistan, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Uzbekistan—leaving out the bulk of the Islamic world, in which Sufism is nearly ubiquitous. He seems to have conducted no original research and consulted only English-language sources. His main thesis is unassailable. Sufism’s goal is to provide mystical union with God, often through the mediation of a “saint.” Sufi orders are not organized for conventional political action; this apparent apoliticism makes them attractive to autocrats with Muslim constituencies, who use Sufism to counter radical Islam and Islamist violence. Unfortunately, readers do not hear from Sufis themselves. It would have been helpful to learn how they see their mission and their adversaries and to know whether they believe they are perpetually doomed to serve as pawns in abusive systems or whether they think they could broker dialogue between autocrats and mobilized Muslim constituencies."

What determines whether those countries agree to host them? Gresh seeks to answer this question by focusing on a half century of negotiations that Bahrain, Oman, and Saudi Arabia—all of which host U.S. forces—have conducted with the United States. Gresh argues that if a foreign government perceives internal security threats as paramount, it will be reluctant to host U.S. bases. But when external security threats prevail, governments will tolerate (and even welcome) the presence of American forces. His analysis does not sufficiently address the fact that some threats are both internal and external: consider, for example, Iran’s support for Shiite minorities in the Gulf Arab kingdoms and Yemen. Gresh also does not explore the dilemmas faced by Washington caused by establishing U.S. bases in places such as Bahrain, where repressive regimes abuse segments of their own populations—perhaps because that kind of political liability does not seem to trouble the American electorate."
38,ISIS: Inside the Army of Terror,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2016-02-10/isis-inside-army-terror,ISIS: Inside the Army of Terror,"Weiss and Hassan capture the complexity of the Iraqi and Syrian imbroglios that gave rise to the Islamic State (or ISIS) in this thorough and accessible book. ISIS resulted from a merger of sorts between remnants of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein’s Baathist regime and followers of the Shiite-hating Jordanian jihadist Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. The authors suggest that ISIS’ ability to control territory, gather intelligence, and smuggle oil stems mainly from the experience and know-how of the former Baathists. After a revolt broke out in Syria in 2011, the beleaguered president, Bashar al-Assad, abetted ISIS’ spread and even cut deals with the group in order to bolster his claim that his enemies were irredeemable terrorists. While the book does not alter the consensus narrative of the rise of ISIS, it does provide fascinating details about the 2007 anti-jihadist Sunni uprising in Iraq and about jihadist groups’ use of U.S. prisons as recruiting grounds. In this portrait, ISIS emerges as a strategic organization playing a long game; counterterrorist raids and bombing runs will not defeat it."
39,Iran’s Political Economy Since the Revolution,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2016-02-10/irans-political-economy-revolution,Iran’s Political Economy Since the Revolution,"Maloney covers Iran’s political economy since the fall of the Qajar dynasty in 1921, with a heavy emphasis on the years since the Iranian Revolution of 1979. She begins with an unsurprising premise: economic crises have driven Iranian politics. Inflation helped bring down the shah; the unraveling of the economy during the Iran-Iraq War brought in a “pragmatic” president, Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani; and economic mismanagement under Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, combined with effective international sanctions, set the stage for the election of President Hassan Rouhani in 2013. Maloney stresses the constant tussle pitting redistributionists in the parliament, who have been a thorn in the side of every Iranian president, against the more economically orthodox Guardian Council. Two important takeaways emerge from her analysis: the Islamic Republic is surprisingly plural, although not democratic, and remarkably resilient. After the revolution, GDP dropped by 32 percent, three million skilled Iranians left the country, three million Afghan refugees came in, and Iraq initiated an eight-year war with devastating consequences. Subsequent decades have not been much kinder, but the regime has survived."

It is a wondrous, if difficult, voyage. He argues that the convoluted politics of the Sunni-dominated northern part of the country and its capital city, Tripoli, serve as a paradigm for the plight of Sunnis throughout the Levant. In 1982, during the Lebanese civil war, Syria asserted control over the region, but it withdrew its forces in 2005 after the assassination of Lebanon’s Sunni prime minister, Rafiq Hariri. Soon thereafter, Hariri’s son Saad tried to assert what Rougier calls “institutional” Sunni control over the north but was humiliated when the Shiite militant group Hezbollah took over several neighborhoods in West Beirut in 2008. In the absence of strong Sunni political leadership, hard-line Salafi sheiks filled the void, and the Islamic State (also known as ISIS) later began to pitch its international jihadism to the region’s youth. Today, northern Lebanon represents a vital strategic arena for the protagonists in Syria’s civil war. Control of the Tripoli-Qalamoun-Qusayr corridor is existentially important for the alliance formed by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, Hezbollah, and Iran and also crucial for the Sunni jihadist groups that seek to overthrow Assad. The struggle for control has produced a crucible of political intrigue and religious zealotry. Throughout the region, this Sunni-Shiite rivalry is unfolding with equal viciousness."

Full-blown civil wars rage in Iraq, Libya, Syria, and Yemen. Nascent conflicts simmer in Egypt, South Sudan, and Turkey. Various forms of spillover from these civil wars threaten the stability of Algeria, Jordan, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, and Tunisia. Tensions between Iran and Saudi Arabia have risen to new heights, raising the specter of a regionwide religious war. Israel and the Palestinians have experienced a resurgence of low-level violence. Kuwait, Morocco, Oman, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates have weathered the storm so far, but even they are terrified of what is going on around them. Not since the Mongol invasions of the thirteenth century has the Middle East seen so much chaos."

The story and its telling are at once accessible and biting. And although he covers a great deal of history, the historical details are not merely decoration but vital to his analysis. He feels no tenderness toward Russian President Vladimir Putin, nor does he condone what Putin and his country have done in Ukraine. But mindful of the deep and complex history of Russia’s relationship with Ukraine and the stakes Russia has in the outcome of the current impasse, he underscores in blunt and unsentimental terms how Russia, for all its failings and vulnerabilities, still holds the upper hand. Any deal struck to end the crisis should be between Russia and Ukraine alone and will have to hew more closely to Russia’s terms than to those of Ukraine or its well-wishers in western Europe and the United States."

Thirty years later, he was discovered and prosecuted in the United States, Israel, and, ultimately, Germany. He died before he could appeal a five-year German prison sentence for the crime of “accessory to the murder of at least 28,060 Jews at the Sobibor death camp.” Behind this story lies a fraught web of issues that Douglas untangles with exceptional skill. These begin with the challenge posed to legal systems by the immensity of the Holocaust, a crime that no punishment could requite. Ideally, Douglas argues, atrocity trials should act as “didactic exercises.” Demjanjuk’s 1987 trial in Israel failed that test; his conviction was overturned because the Israeli prosecutors had wrongly identified him as a particularly monstrous figure from the Treblinka death camp. The book is a tour de force owing to Douglas’ piercing analysis of all the legal complexities: denationalization (which was the limited recourse the United States sought in Demjanjuk’s case), the impact of the Cold War on this and other trials, and, above all, the hopeless inadequacy of German law, which was partially redressed by the court’s innovations in prosecuting the Demjanjuk case."

They often disagree, particularly with Andranik Migranyan’s opening argument that in Russia, only an authoritarian regime can create the order needed to build democracy. But their arguments with one another probe the genuinely complicated issues of how democratic or authoritarian Vladimir Putin’s Russia has become, the likely direction the country will take, and how Russia stacks up against the realities (as opposed to the self-images) of democracies, including the United States. Some of the arguments center on chicken-or-egg questions: Which comes first, a strong state as a prerequisite for democracy or progress toward democracy as the prerequisite for an effective state? A number of essays also explore Russia’s political trajectory: Is the current system simply a stage in an ongoing evolution—and if so, toward what? Or is it a relatively stable endpoint? Above all, the book forces the reader to ponder not merely Russia’s political course but also the idea of democracy itself."

Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, the scale of sex, labor, and child trafficking inside Russia has soared. But Russia also is itself a human-trafficking problem, because it serves as a supplier for illicit networks far beyond its borders. McCarthy describes the nature and dimensions of the problem with as much detail as possible, given the patchiness of the statistical record on the phenomenon. Only in 2003 did Russian legislators pass a law to deal with this scourge, and McCarthy focuses on its enforcement—or, more often, lack of enforcement. In a fine addition to the literature on how Russian governance really works, McCarthy traces this laxity to what she calls “institutional machinery”: incentives, structures, and a culture operating within Russian legal and judicial institutions that militate against the strenuous enforcement of new rules that introduce complex choices and burdensome procedures on law enforcement agencies. Still, she notes that, in an oblique fashion, authorities are making some progress."

That infatuation drives this book’s historical explorations and philosophical reflections, which Kaplan merges with travel accounts to form a panorama including Romania’s origins and identity, its political idiosyncrasies, its people’s sense of victimhood, and the striking insights of its intellectuals. He organizes the book around three visits he made to the country: first in 1981, when Romania was still stuck in the sterile, crushing Ceausescu era; then in 2013, when the country was poised between the modernizing effects of its new pro-Western orientation and the deeply carved traces of its intricate past; and finally in the spring of 2014, after the upheaval in Ukraine had rewritten the script shaping Romania’s geopolitical hopes. Kaplan moves seamlessly from sights, sounds, and conversations to the resonance of history: Roman, Byzantine, Ottoman, and Soviet. Along the way, he considers works that he treasures from the underappreciated canon of Romanian literature and music. In Kaplan’s hands, Romania emerges as no mere footnote, but as a historical and political pivot."

Zahra, in wave after wave of detail, makes plain that the story is not so simple. Many who came found the New World harsh, unwelcoming, and alien, and a third of them returned home, even though during the late nineteenth century, many European governments sought to rid their societies of minorities and “undesirables”—in the Russian case, 2.7 million Jews and Polish and German speakers. Other countries fought against emigration as a threat to their national projects. By the turn of the century, however, some governments and nationalist movements sought to aid their kinsmen in foreign lands or saw them as the spear of colonizing efforts, at least in Latin America. Zahra handles this immensely complicated and multidimensional history with remarkable clarity and feeling."

In Latin America alone, Albertus calculates, 128 million hectares of land were expropriated and redistributed from 1930 to 2008. He carefully distinguishes between three types of land reform: radical redistribution without compensation; land negotiation with market-based compensation; and colonization, whereby state lands are transferred to settlers. Drawing on a large database of comparative cases and well-focused country studies (mostly, but not exclusively, from Latin America), Albertus concludes that radical redistribution—his main interest—is most likely to occur when divisions exist between national elites and few institutional constraints prevent the adoption of the policy. Albertus also contends that land reforms that permanently redistribute assets can be more effective than progressive taxes in correcting inequalities in wealth and power. One surprising finding of his challenges much of the established literature on this subject: radical land reform is more likely in an autocracy, where power is concentrated, than in a democracy, where vested interests enjoy many channels through which they can stymie reform."

To judge from Bernal’s memoir, Jamaicans have taken that message to heart. Bernal, a former Jamaican ambassador to the United States, makes the case that despite being a small, geopolitically irrelevant island, Jamaica has often had its way with its much more powerful neighbor. He recounts how during his tenure in the 1990s, on issues such as trade preferences, foreign aid, debt relief, and counternarcotics, Jamaica succeeded in moving Washington closer to Jamaican preferences by building a constituency of Jamaican American immigrants and influential Americans from Jamaican families, such as Colin Powell and Harry Belafonte. Jamaican diplomats also knew how to work the interagency process within the remarkably accessible U.S. executive branch, knock on the right doors in Congress (despite the “astonishing” ignorance of world affairs found on Capitol Hill), and network with think tanks and other policy entrepreneurs. Bernal also emphasizes the importance of doing one’s homework, building trust with important policy players, and identifying mutual interests. Interestingly, Bernal argues that information technology empowers small states by decreasing their transaction costs and increasing their capacity to mobilize constituencies."

Between 1971 and 2013, despite massive foreign assistance, Haiti’s per capita income fell by 0.7 percent every year, on average, owing to low growth and to a population explosion. Nearly 60 percent of Haitians still cannot meet their basic needs. In pinpointing causes, the authors fault Haitian business elites for not paying taxes and for taking part in anticompetitive practices. Despite an abundance of technical assistance from international institutions, Haiti’s legal and regulatory frameworks are “dysfunctional,” the country suffers from a “near total absence” of urban planning, and the government still cannot perform many basic functions. Fundamentally, “a social contract is missing between the State and its citizens.” And the future looks grim: the study warns of the dangers of rising urban violence among disaffected, undereducated youth. Nevertheless, the report concludes with a number of promising policy proposals, which must be undertaken simultaneously to be effective: maintaining macroeconomic stability, improving the collection and analysis of statistics, creating better jobs, rebuilding the social contract, and reducing the vulnerabilities of households to financial shocks and natural disasters."
52,"Fix it, Don’t Ditch it",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2016-02-17/fix-it-dont-ditch-it,"Fix it, Don’t Ditch it","David Edelstein and Ronald Krebs (“Delusions of Grand Strategy,” November/December 2015) rightly point out that in planning for national security, it is difficult to calculate costs and benefits and to accurately assess perceived threats. But that does not mean that policymakers should abandon strategizing. Similar challenges pervade domestic state-level government planning and the corporate sector, where the value of planning has long been recognized."
53,Russia’s Rebalance?,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2016-02-17/russias-rebalance,Russia’s Rebalance?,"Fu Ying (“How China Sees Russia,” January/February 2016) argues that in the triangular relationship among China, Russia, and the United States, the points representing Moscow and Washington are farthest apart. This is certainly true in eastern Europe and, to a lesser extent, the Middle East. Yet in the Asia-Pacific, Russia and the United States have few outstanding differences and a long history of collaboration against third-party threats."
54,Making the Grade,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2016-02-17/making-grade,Making the Grade,"Alexander Cooley and Jack Snyder (“Rank Has Its Privileges,” November/December 2015) condemn the ratings produced by organizations such as the World Bank and Freedom House for what they describe as methodological inconsistencies and oversimplifications. Yet the alternatives Cooley and Snyder propose underscore the many virtues of the current ratings system."
55,Is Innovation Over?,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/review-essay/2016-02-15/innovation-over,Is Innovation Over?,"Almost seven years after the Great Recession officially ended, the U.S. economy continues to grow at a sluggish rate. Real wages are stagnant. The real median wage earned by men in the United States is lower today than it was in 1969. Median household income, adjusted for inflation, is lower now than it was in 1999 and has barely risen in the past several years despite the formal end of the recession in 2009. Meanwhile, the U.S. Federal Reserve Board and the Congressional Budget Office have taken more seriously the idea that U.S. productivity, one of the most important sources of economic growth, may stay low. And such problems are hardly unique to the United States. Indeed, productivity growth has been slow in most of the developed world for some time."
56,A Feminist Foreign Policy,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/review-essay/2016-02-15/feminist-foreign-policy,A Feminist Foreign Policy,"When Hillary Clinton’s career as a lawyer first drew media attention during the 1992 presidential campaign of her husband, Bill Clinton, she mused that she could have skipped law practice to stay at home and bake cookies. The comment led to a now-famous cookie bake-off between Clinton and Barbara Bush, which the upstart Arkansas governor’s wife handily won. Eighteen years later, as secretary of state in the administration of U.S. President Barack Obama, Clinton supported an ambitious effort to put energy-efficient, environmentally friendly cookstoves in the kitchens of 100 million poor women around the world. “By upgrading these dirty stoves, millions of lives could be saved and improved,” she proclaimed."
57,Diplomacy Disrupted,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/diplomacy-disrupted,Diplomacy Disrupted,"Last December, during a debate among the Republican candidates for the U.S. presidency, Senator Ted Cruz attacked the idea that the United States should pursue regime change in Syria. If Washington tries to topple Bashar al-Assad, Cruz warned, the jihadists of the self-proclaimed Islamic State (also known as ISIS) “will take over Syria, and it will worsen U.S. national security interests.” Cruz suggested a different plan: “Instead of being a Woodrow Wilson democracy promoter, we ought to hunt down our enemies and kill ISIS rather than creating opportunities for ISIS to take control of new countries.”"
58,Hunger Games,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/hunger-games,Hunger Games,"Nearly 3,000 years ago, according to the Old Testament, an army of Arameans, led by King Ben-hadad, besieged the West Bank city of Samaria. Cut off from its agricultural hinterlands, the city soon ran out of food. In desperation, many people appear to have resorted to consuming barely edible sources of nutrients, including “dove’s dung” and the scraps of flesh that they could scavenge from donkeys’ skulls. Eventually, even those grew scarce, and the Bible recounts that the starving inhabitants of the city turned to killing and eating their own children."
59,What Rome Can Teach Us Today,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/review-essay/2016-02-15/what-rome-can-teach-us-today,What Rome Can Teach Us Today,"Ancient Rome was a village that grew into a world empire. At the peak of its territorial reach, AD 117, it stretched from the British Isles to Mesopotamia and from the Rhine to the Sahara. Its history spans more than a millennium. Before the Western Roman Empire collapsed in the late fifth century, Romans enjoyed a standard of living not seen again in the West until the mid-nineteenth century. They had flush toilets, granite countertops, indoor heating, and even cosmetic dentistry. The government that safeguarded this way of life styled itself Senatus Populusque Romanus, or “the Senate and the People of Rome.” An advertisement for the link between Rome’s citizens and its elected leaders, the abbreviation “SPQR” was proudly displayed everywhere."
60,The Next Front on Climate Change,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/world/next-front-climate-change,The Next Front on Climate Change,"After dithering for decades, governments finally seem to be paying serious attention to the problem of global climate change. Late last year, at the Paris climate conference, they adopted a major new agreement to limit global warming, beginning a process to strengthen commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions over time. For many observers, the promises of the Paris conference offer too little, too late, because emissions are high and still rising and because there will be major disruptions to the climate even if countries meet their emissions-reduction pledges. Nevertheless, it had been 18 years since the world’s governments left a major climate summit with an agreement in hand, so just getting to yes in Paris has offered climate diplomacy fresh credibility."
61,Japan’s New Realism,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/japan/2016-02-16/japans-new-realism,Japan’s New Realism,"Last September, tens of thousands of opponents of Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe gathered outside the National Diet building in Tokyo, often in torrential rain, holding placards and shouting antiwar slogans. They were there to protest the imminent passage of legislation designed to allow Japan’s military to mobilize overseas for the first time in 70 years—a shift they feared would undermine Japan’s pacifistic constitution and encourage adventurism. On September 17, Japan’s normally sedate parliament dissolved into scuffles as opposition politicians tried and failed to prevent a vote on the bills, which ultimately passed."
62,The Study-Abroad Solution,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2016-02-16/study-abroad-solution,The Study-Abroad Solution,"In the Internet age, the world feels far smaller than it used to. But many Americans still know little about the rest of the world and may be more detached from it than ever. Such a lack of awareness is, in certain respects, understandable. Once the Cold War ended, some 25 years ago, Congress, perhaps out of a false sense of security, cut the foreign affairs budget, which led to the closing of some U.S. overseas posts. The news media, especially the commercial television networks, took their cue and began to reduce overseas coverage—responding, they said, to the decline of public interest in such matters, which conveniently coincided with their own economic woes. Although the 9/11 attacks and the subsequent wars in Afghanistan and Iraq stimulated renewed attention to international events, that phenomenon proved short-lived. Consequently, as new global challenges have arisen in recent years, American discourse on world affairs has lacked historical context or deeper understanding. It has become difficult to stir thoughtful, informed debate on foreign policy issues during congressional—or even presidential—campaigns. Many politicians who aspire to lead the country seem not to understand what constitutes a foreign policy issue, let alone the complexity of dealing with one. A candidate who speaks a foreign language appears almost suspect."
63,The Good News From Google,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/interviews/2016-02-15/good-news-google,The Good News From Google,"Ruth Porat has taken an unusual path to the tech world. Before becoming the chief financial officer at Google in May 2015 (and then at Alphabet, Google’s new parent company, a few months later), she held the same post at Morgan Stanley, where among other roles she worked closely with the U.S. government to sort out the troubles at the insurance corporation AIG and the mortgage-financing agencies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac during the 2008 financial crisis. On the shortlist to become deputy treasury secretary in 2013 (before she withdrew her name), Porat, who Politico once referred to as “the most powerful woman on Wall Street,” is now one of the most powerful women in Silicon Valley as well. Some six months into the new job, she met with Foreign Affairs’ managing editor, Jonathan Tepperman, in New York to discuss her move and the global economy."
64,The Lost Art of Economic Statecraft,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/united-states/lost-art-economic-statecraft,The Lost Art of Economic Statecraft,"Despite boasting the most powerful economy on earth, the United States too often reaches for the gun instead of the purse in its foreign policy. The country has hardly outgrown its need for military force, but over the past several decades, it has increasingly forgotten a tradition that stretches back to the nation’s founding: the use of economic instruments to accomplish geopolitical objectives, a practice we term “geoeconomics.”"
65,Can China’s Companies Conquer the World?,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2016-02-16/can-chinas-companies-conquer-world,Can China’s Companies Conquer the World?,"Despite China’s recent economic struggles, many economists and analysts argue that the country remains on course to overtake the United States and become the world’s leading economic power someday soon. Indeed, this has become a mainstream view—if not quite a consensus belief—on both sides of the Pacific. But proponents of this position often neglect to take into account an important truth: economic power is closely related to business power, an area in which China still lags far behind the United States."
66,ISIS Goes Global,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/middle-east/2016-03-01/isis-goes-global,ISIS Goes Global,"The downing of a Russian passenger plane over Egypt’s Sinai Peninsula last October, for which the Islamic State (also known as ISIS) claimed responsibility, may ultimately prove more consequential than the horrific attacks in Paris and San Bernardino, California, that followed. Western security officials had long worried that their countries’ own citizens would conduct attacks after returning home from Iraq or Syria or strike out as “lone wolf” terrorists. But the Russian plane crash, which killed 224 people, was caused by a different beast: neither lone wolves nor ISIS itself but an ISIS affiliate that had pledged its loyalty to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, ISIS’ self-declared caliph. ISIS calls these groups wilayat, Arabic for “provinces.” (The term is borrowed from the seventh century, when the armies of Islam burst out of the Arabian Peninsula and established regional governors who ruled in the name of the caliph; ISIS also uses wilayat to refer to administrative divisions within Iraq and Syria.) If, as recent events suggest, ISIS far-flung provinces have begun closely aligning their actions with those of the group’s core leadership in Iraq and Syria, then ISIS geographic scope has expanded vastly."
67,Eurasia’s Coming Anarchy,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2016-02-15/eurasias-coming-anarchy,Eurasia’s Coming Anarchy,"As China asserts itself in its nearby seas and Russia wages war in Syria and Ukraine, it is easy to assume that Eurasia’s two great land powers are showing signs of newfound strength. But the opposite is true: increasingly, China and Russia flex their muscles not because they are powerful but because they are weak. Unlike Nazi Germany, whose power at home in the 1930s fueled its military aggression abroad, today’s revisionist powers are experiencing the reverse phenomenon. In China and Russia, it is domestic insecurity that is breeding belligerence. This marks a historical turning point: for the first time since the Berlin Wall fell, the United States finds itself in a competition among great powers."
68,Middle-Class Heroes,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2016-02-15/middle-class-heroes,Middle-Class Heroes,"The two economic developments that have garnered the most attention in recent years are the concentration of massive wealth in the richest one percent of the world’s population and the tremendous, growth-driven decline in extreme poverty in the developing world, especially in China. But just as important has been the emergence of large middle classes in developing countries around the planet. This phenomenon—the result of more than two decades of nearly continuous fast-paced global economic growth—has been good not only for economies but also for governance. After all, history suggests that a large and secure middle class is a solid foundation on which to build and sustain an effective, democratic state. Middle classes not only have the wherewithal to finance vital services such as roads and public education through taxes; they also demand regulations, the fair enforcement of contracts, and the rule of law more generally—public goods that create a level social and economic playing field on which all can prosper."
69,The Demographics of Stagnation,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/world/2016-02-15/demographics-stagnation,The Demographics of Stagnation,"In every single region of the world, economic growth has failed to return to the rate it averaged before the Great Recession. Economists have come up with a variety of theories for why this recovery has been the weakest in postwar history, including high indebtedness, growing income inequality, and excess caution induced by the original debt crisis. Although each explanation has some merit, experts have largely overlooked what may be the most important factor: the global slowdown in the growth of the labor force."
70,Can Central Banks Goose Growth?,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/world/can-central-banks-goose-growth,Can Central Banks Goose Growth?,"In the years since the global financial crisis of 2008 engulfed the world and the United States fell into the Great Recession, the panic has subsided and Western economies have recovered to varying degrees. But the downturn’s effects have proved profound and lasting, and serious risks persist for the global economy. The recovery has been slow, inflation levels remain below the targets set by central banks, and total debt levels are much higher than before the crisis began."
71,Learning to Love Stagnation,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/japan/learning-love-stagnation,Learning to Love Stagnation,"From Wall Street to K Street to Main Street, pessimism about the global economy has become commonplace. The world economy may have finally emerged from the financial crisis of 2008, but according to conventional wisdom, it remains fragile and unsteady, just one disruption away from yet another perilous downturn."
72,The Age of Secular Stagnation,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2016-02-15/age-secular-stagnation,The Age of Secular Stagnation,"As surprising as the recent financial crisis and recession were, the behavior of the world’s industrialized economies and financial markets during the recovery has been even more so."

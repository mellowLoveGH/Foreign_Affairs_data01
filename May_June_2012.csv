0,Bearish on Brazil,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/brazil/2012-04-24/bearish-brazil,Bearish on Brazil,"Until recently, the consensus view of Brazil among investors and pundits was almost universally bullish. Under the landmark presidency of Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, the country became known as a paragon of financial responsibility among emerging markets. Having contained hyperinflation and reduced its debt, Brazil weathered the 2008 financial crisis better than most, growing at an average annual rate of nearly four percent over the past five years. And in the last ten years, some 30 million Brazilians have entered the middle class, giving their country, according to Brazil's promoters, the power to expand despite a turbulent global environment and to reduce income inequality even as it grew elsewhere in Latin America."

These two timely studies document this development and assess its benefits and costs to the region. From the Latin American perspective, the badly needed capital and accompanying access to Chinese markets are clearly welcome. But certain Chinese investment practices violate hard-won international standards and demand correction."

In this highly readable monograph, two of Mexico’s leading public intellectuals identify the country’s expanding, prosperous middle class -- similar in many ways to its counterparts in other emerging-market economies or, for that matter, in the United States -- as the dominant factor in a paradigm shift that is transforming modern Mexico for the better. Behind this fortuitous trend are steady, if modest, economic growth rates, more open and competitive markets, and the smaller families that result from sharply declining fertility rates. De la Calle and Rubio employ an admittedly elastic culture-based definition of “middle class”: families that believe that a better future is possible and see education as the best means to upward social mobility. Such a classification based on individuals’ aspirations will sit more comfortably with marketing firms and pollsters than with social scientists, who favor traditional metrics of income and wealth. But savvy companies and politicians who appeal to this burgeoning middle class will crush competitors still adhering to outdated mythologies.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."
3,UN Peacekeeping in Africa: From the Suez Crisis to the Sudan Conflicts,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2012-05-01/un-peacekeeping-africa-suez-crisis-sudan-conflicts,UN Peacekeeping in Africa: From the Suez Crisis to the Sudan Conflicts,"Roughly 40 percent of all armed United Nations peacekeeping operations have occurred in Africa, and the biggest and most expensive to date is the current UN mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which involves some 20,000 soldiers. Adebajo argues that such operations can succeed only under certain conditions. First, the backing of the permanent members of the UN Security Council is crucial, as peacekeeping missions are much less likely to secure budgetary resources and diplomatic support without it. Second, the peacekeepers must rely on the cooperation of the local belligerent parties in order to neutralize potential spoilers. Finally, neighboring countries and regional powers, such as Nigeria and South Africa in the case of Congo, can increase the chances of success by providing diplomatic and military support to peacekeeping efforts. Of course, all three of these exacting conditions rarely exist in combination, and most UN operations in the region cannot be considered successful. Adebajo pleads for more support from Western powers for multilateral peacekeeping operations and advocates a larger peacekeeping role for regional organizations such as the African Union.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

Pepin has written an absorbing analysis of the roots of the epidemic. It reads a bit like a crime novel, as he gathers evidence from various colonial-era archives to trace the spread of the virus, beginning with its initial transmission from chimpanzees to humans in central Africa sometime during the first half of the twentieth century. Pepin argues convincingly that modernization, urbanization, and the growth of prostitution all combined with catastrophic flaws in colonial health systems to aid the spread of the virus. He presents a readable explanation of the complex biological details of the virus and its different strains while also providing an intriguing social history of central Africa."
5,Africa’s Moment,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2012-05-01/africas-moment,Africa’s Moment,"This book delivers a lively introduction to contemporary sub-Saharan Africa, surveying current trends in the region, including the recent emergence of a number of dynamic economies, the high costs of endemic corruption, the stubborn persistence of civil war, and the destabilizing potential of elections in fledgling democracies. Most interesting, however, is Severino and Ray’s emphasis on demographic changes and natural-resource issues. They cite projections that the population of Africa will exceed 1.8 billion people in 2050 -- a quarter more than China’s predicted population by that point. Such population growth will entail massive urbanization and put enormous pressure on natural resources, especially water, with potentially explosive political consequences. But it will also create significant economic opportunities. Arrestingly, the authors also predict that urbanization will lead to a progressive decline in the salience of ethnic conflict in the region, as Africans move away from parochial identities and toward broader ones.

Charles Taylor rose from modest circumstances to become a powerful warlord during the civil war in Liberia in the 1990s. In 1997, he was elected president, but he was later forced from office. In 2003, the Special Court for Sierra Leone (based in The Hague) indicted Taylor for a bevy of war crimes, including terrorism, rape, and the conscription of child soldiers. (A verdict in the case is expected soon.) Waugh relates this story with a wealth of telling details that reveal Taylor as a savvy strategist who carefully nurtured his relationship with the press and courted a wide range of international allies, from Libya’s Muammar al-Qaddafi to French officials to Burkina Faso’s president, Blaise Compaoré, all of whom offered Taylor diplomatic support and resources at one time or another. Waugh never underestimates Taylor, but he also makes it clear that Taylor’s sole motivation has always been a desire for personal aggrandizement and wealth.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."
7,China Hand: An Autobiography,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2012-05-01/china-hand-autobiography,China Hand: An Autobiography,"Davies was a U.S. Foreign Service officer best known as one of the victims of the Red Scare purges in the early 1950s. He died in 1999, leaving behind this unfinished memoir. It deals mostly with his time in Burma (now officially called Myanmar), China, and India as a civilian aide to U.S. General Joseph Stilwell during World War II; his service in the U.S. embassy in Moscow after the war; and his feud with Patrick Hurley, then U.S. ambassador to China, over relations with the Chinese Communists. Davies acknowledges that his advice to try to win the Chinese Communists away from Moscow’s side was unrealistic. At the same time, he shows how Chiang Kai-shek manipulated American policy and how Hurley laid the basis for the McCarthy-era witch-hunt by portraying some of the best-informed Foreign Service officers who worked with him as having a pro-communist bias. The book is filled with vivid personalities and brings to life the fluid strategic situation at the end of the war. Its wry style makes for a delightful read, even though the foreordained outcome suffuses the story with regret.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

Their work belongs to a wave of independent Chinese scholarship that demystifies China’s role in the conflict by showing the country to be a self-interested state like any other. In these translated selections from their work, they address key episodes in relations among China, the Soviet Union, North Korea, and North Vietnam. The basic method is a painstaking analysis of documents; still, the stories crackle with the tension of real politics. They find that Mao’s decision to enter the Korean War was not planned in advance but was taken reluctantly in response to the American intervention, which Mao had not expected; that disputes over command, strategy, and logistics bitterly divided the Chinese and Korean allies throughout the war and after; and that North Korean leader Kim Il Sung’s fear of a pro-China faction in his own party led to the withdrawal of Chinese troops from the North in 1958. Throughout the episodes Shen and Li studied, national interest always trumped proletarian solidarity, a truth that remains useful as contemporary observers peer behind the façade of Beijing-Pyongyang comity today.

9,Walmart in China,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2012-05-01/walmart-china,Walmart in China,"In the last decade or so, a Bentonville–Guangdong nexus has become one of the thickest links in the U.S.-Chinese relationship. If Walmart were a country, it would be China’s sixth-largest export market. The Arkansas-based merchandiser has become the sole customer for an entire network of subcontractors and sub-subcontractors throughout southern China. With its buying power and tight logistical management, the retailer virtually controls its suppliers without having to own them. Walmart has also become a major retailer in China, with about 200 stores catering to the rising middle class. The book’s contributors used cloak-and-dagger fieldwork skills to provide a sharp picture of labor conditions at Walmart’s suppliers and in its Chinese stores. They show that the company’s Ethical Standards Program has done little to prevent sweatshop-like abuses among its suppliers. On the other hand, its store employees have taken easily to the corporate culture, whose Christian- and rural-inflected ethos meshes with Chinese traditions of moral exhortation, mutual surveillance, and the pursuit of personal ambition through collective service.

10,China Experiments: From Local Innovations to National Reform,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2012-05-01/china-experiments-local-innovations-national-reform,China Experiments: From Local Innovations to National Reform,"This book suggests that China is moving toward a new kind of authoritarianism, one that provides “greater voice and accountability” and is responsive enough to blur the distinction with democracy. China’s leaders face the need to rebalance state-society relations and cultivate greater legitimacy in response to the rise of a middle class, new media, and rights consciousness. Even though one-party rule remains sacrosanct, the authors identify a variety of local experiments that have loosened top-down control and opened channels for citizen input. These include an electronic supervision system to prevent corruption in issuing administrative approvals for new businesses in Shenzhen, the use of various forms of opinion polling and semi-competitive elections to help select government and party officials at the lowest levels, government cultivation of certain citizen groups that provide social services, and the adoption of regulations to increase public access to government information. The question is whether these experiments are less-than-halfway measures designed only to disguise the true structure of power or whether they are the early signs of real change, as the authors seem to believe.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

As an anthropologist, Thiranagama is interested in how uncontrollable eruptions of violence dislocate people’s lives. The Tamil Tigers said they were fighting for a “Tamil homeland,” but their people lost everything from houses to social networks to traditional social identities. Thiranagama interviewed people who had survived the death of loved ones and the loss of property and somehow reconstituted their lives in Sri Lanka or abroad. But they found their personal and family roles blurred, ethnic identities made more rigid, and barriers heightened between individuals and communities. Moving from event to event and shifting among individual narratives, historical events, and anthropological theories, the book does not quite come together. But it leaves a profound sense of the victims’ unfathomable losses. Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

The camps house an estimated 100,000–200,000 members of the so-called hostile classes, who are forced to labor on starvation rations until they die. Shin’s father was imprisoned because his brothers had escaped to the South during the Korean War. Shin was born in the camp in 1982 and inherited his family’s guilt. Each phase of Shin’s young life reveals aspects of the North Korean reality: the merciless regimen of the camps, the poverty and corruption outside them, the parlous existence of North Korean refugees in China, and their isolation in South Korea if they are lucky enough to make it there. Shin eventually came to the United States, where he now promotes awareness of the camp system while continuing what will probably be a lifelong struggle with the psychological damage of his traumatic past. The six known North Korean total-control camps remain visible on Google Earth today. Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."
13,Algeria: France’s Undeclared War,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2012-05-01/algeria-frances-undeclared-war,Algeria: France’s Undeclared War,"In the dismantling of Western empires that took place following World War II, no case was more dramatic or more tragic than the brutal eight-year war the Algerians fought, beginning in 1954, to end over 100 years of colonial domination by France. This confrontation has never lacked its historians, memoirists, and polemicists. But Evans, a master scholar, has produced a comprehensive narrative, concentrating on the years of the ""undeclared war"" but also giving sufficient attention to the colonial era of 1830 to 1954. This is a history equally of Algeria and France, as it must be. The book carefully documents the violence and torture committed by both sides of the conflict, whose grim history is matched by a grim aftermath and legacy. French President Charles de Gaulle finally got France out of Algeria but callously turned his back on the fleeing French settlers and on the harkis, Algerians who had fought for France. The Algerian revolutionaries who led the fight for independence became a military caste that has ruled the country ever since."

Four years later, the move from “chaos” to “the brink” does not augur any improvement. Rashid presents Pakistan as a failing state with an irresponsible civilian leadership and a military fixated on threats from India. Next door in Afghanistan, President Hamid Karzai is a disappointment, and the Obama administration waffles with surges, announced withdrawals, and tentative talks with the Afghan Taliban. Meanwhile, terrorist groups and Islamist movements are gaining ground in the region. This somber book opens with a compelling narration of the killing of Osama bin Laden and closes with a fine survey of the many neighboring countries that influence events in Afghanistan and Pakistan, from the Gulf states and Iran to China and India. This century’s Great Game in Asia is a multiplayer matter. No one should be overlooked. Many could play the spoiler."

Both books perceptively analyze the interrelatedness of these developments and the coinciding events in Algeria, Iraq, Sudan, and non-Arab states such as Turkey. Lynch and Bishara are in broad agreement about the causes and consequences of the uprisings (the brittleness of security states led by all-in-the-family presidential monarchies), the vital role played by youth in the revolutionary movements, the significance of the delayed participation of Islamists, the impact of new media technologies, and the continuing importance of Arab and Muslim perceptions of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. They differ in appraising the United States’ role. Although they share scorn for the Bush administration’s approach to the Middle East, Lynch sees the Obama administration’s response to the so-called Arab Spring as rapid and effective, whereas Bishara concludes that Barack Obama “has lacked any discernible policy.”Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

An updated edition, Waging Peace: Israel and the Arabs, 1948–2003, appeared in 2004. Now, Waging Peace has given way to The Lingering Conflict, and the conflict it describes pits Israel against not just the Arabs but the entire Middle East, a reflection of the country’s increasingly fraught relations with Iran and Turkey. Like the earlier editions, the latest one concentrates on the Israeli side of the story but is dispassionate and fair in appraising the attitudes and actions of others. Rabinovich, an eminent Israeli scholar and diplomat, paints a picture of the domestic and foreign policy crosscurrents confronting all the parties and inhibiting momentum toward peace. In his conclusion, he expresses a hope that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu might still adopt bold new policies, as did earlier right-wing governments led by Menachem Begin and Ariel Sharon. Otherwise, it is likely that the next edition of this book will still have the title The Lingering Conflict."

He moves on to write the most incisive account available of the U.S.-Iranian diplomacy that has followed in the years since. Parsi’s emphasis is on the Obama administration, which sought a reset of relations with Iran but has instead presided over a deterioration in relations. This eminently readable, sometimes gripping book also examines the Iranian side of the equation and details the roles of many others players: the EU, Russia, China, the Arab states, Turkey, and even Brazil. The multiplicity of actors occurs not just between states but within them. The pressures exerted by Congress and lobbying groups on all U.S. presidents and the tensions within the American executive branch are mirrored by equivalent divisions within the Iranian leadership, which became even more acute after the country’s controversial 2009 presidential election. Nevertheless, Parsi argues that there is still a chance for diplomacy to allow the United States and Iran to break out of their “institutionalized enmity.” Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

It is a monumental effort to understand, in all its complexity, one of the most far-reaching undertakings in the history of socialism in Eastern Europe: the struggle to transform Romanian peasants into Soviet-inspired collective farmers. In a deeply traditional society, no aspect of the communist regime’s social engineering was more wrenching or its implications more dramatic. The results, as the authors richly document, turned out to be far more convoluted, ironic, and layered than histories to this point have suggested. The bricks and mortar of their study are the massive data they assembled, generated from multiple, diverse sources. But the book’s depth results from its thoughtful reflections on the fundamental relationships among people, property, and the state. It offers a model of how histories of this period in Eastern Europe should treat the intricacies of cause and effect, authoritarian design and bureaucratic muddling, and political power and the power of tradition.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

But Eichler’s focus is not the usual questions about the military’s role in Russian politics and foreign policy. Borrowing from feminist theory, Eichler focuses on how militarism informs Russian definitions of masculinity, shaping gender roles and underpinning the structure of power in society. By peeling back layers of Russian culture that Soviet authoritarianism once kept firmly in place, she explores how the collapse of the old system and the wars Russians fought in Afghanistan and Chechnya opened the way for challenges to “militarized masculinity” and the role of the military in legitimating the state. More recently, Vladimir Putin’s ostentatious machismo and the public’s general acceptance of Russia’s post-1999 military campaign in Chechnya have given militarism a reprieve. But Eichler argues that young Russian men -- and, what is especially important, their mothers -- are no longer easily seduced by the state’s military hagiolatry.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

Although each era of trouble has had its own characteristics, the latest always recalls the earliest, a phenomenon that has never been better conveyed than in this ingenious history as biography. To tell the story of the region, Khodarkovsky weighs the life of Semën Atarshchikov. Born in 1807 and raised a Chechen, Atarshchikov enlisted in a Cossack regiment in 1823 to serve the Russian army as a language interpreter, like his father before him. He is caught between two cultures and witnesses the barbarity of Russia’s military campaigns against the peoples of the North Caucasus until his defection to the other side in 1841; his story ends with his murder in 1845 at the hands of his servant, who was intent on defecting back to the Russian side. Khodarkovsky leavens the tale with vivid details about the lives, cultures, and (often violent) fates of the different peoples in the region. One puts down this book with a much clearer sense of the challenge historically raised by this rebellious region for the Russians -- a challenge that, in essence, remains today.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

Russia, he argues, refuses to face the fundamental moral depravity of its Soviet past, including its most savage manifestation: Joseph Stalin’s terror. Until it does, he believes, the country cannot hope to progress. For too long, too many Russians have too easily accepted the idea that the state should enjoy primacy over the value of the individual. Yet in an expansive and brilliantly explored set of examples, Satter illustrates how many people and groups have known and exposed the truth. In an equally compelling fashion, he examines the extraordinarily tangled sentiments that have caused Russian society to hesitate before reconciling itself to the past. Many eastern European societies that did not invent the Soviet system but suffered under it are finding it difficult to agree on how to deal with those who were a part of it. Perhaps, then, it is not so hard to understand why in Russia, where the system had deeper roots, people are reluctant to start settling scores.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

For Gessen, however, it is not merely a side of the man but his essence. She breathes her contempt for him into every paragraph of this book. Gessen was born in the Soviet Union, raised in the United States, and reintegrated into Russia as a skilled investigative reporter. She shines a piercing light into every dark corner of Putin’s story: his self-described thuggish youth; the unsolved murders of some of his prominent critics, such as Anna Politkovskaya and Aleksandr Litvinenko; the expropriation of privately held business empires; his bumbling and insensitive response to the death of Russian sailors aboard the sunken Kursk submarine in 2000; and so on. Gessen has traveled to the far corners of the country and spoken with everyone who has an inside take on what happened. This makes for fascinating, hard-hitting reading but scarcely inspires a sense of scrupulous objectivity -- not when in nearly every ambiguous circumstance, Gessen opts for a sinister explanation that leads back to Putin."

Their testimonies form the rather thin thread from which Latell, a former CIA analyst, hangs his case that Fidel Castro may well have had prior knowledge of Lee Harvey Oswald’s intention to kill U.S. President John F. Kennedy. Latell’s logic is as follows: Castro was supremely dangerous, vengeful, and capable of daring adventures and brilliant deception; he was well informed of Kennedy’s many plots to assassinate him and had used self-defense as a justification for executing or assassinating enemies in the past; and because he micromanaged Cuban intelligence operations, he would have been aware of Oswald’s visits to the Cuban mission in Mexico City a few months prior to Kennedy’s murder. Latell labels the Kennedy-era covert actions against Cuba “a deliberate and massive campaign of international terrorism” but also calls Castro’s alleged failure to warn the U.S. government of Oswald’s intentions his “most despicable decision during his nearly five decades in power.” In Latell’s book, both Kennedy and Castro fare badly; a number of CIA officers who doubted the efficacy of Kennedy’s anti-Castro campaigns come off better.

From 2004 to 2007, Weitzman was the Financial Times' correspondent for the Andean region, based in Lima, Peru -- a country on a continent that he had never before visited. Weitzman's well-written, colorful stories of indigenous protests against plundering multinational resource companies illuminate the appeal of leftist populists such as Hugo Chávez in Venezuela, Evo Morales in Bolivia, and Rafael Correa in Ecuador. But Weitzman conflates these Andean outliers with all of South America, which in fact is typified by more temperate, realistic governments. Most disconcerting, Weitzman begins by sympathetically portraying the Andean leftist populists and excusing their resource nationalism and state interventionism, then suddenly shifts to condemning their profligate economics and confrontational politics. Weitzman seems to have changed his mind on discovering that Chávez has stoked anti-Semitism to fuel social division. Weitzman ritualistically lambasts U.S. diplomacy for not paying more attention to Latin America and for being overbearing when it does. But he fails to prescribe a coherent strategy for addressing the challenge posed by astute leftist populists."

In this short book, which has sparked considerable debate in the United Kingdom, Benn documents the expansion of private and semi-private schools that benefit from tax-exempt status and subsidies yet are disproportionately populated by the children of the wealthy. These schools tend to exclude physically, mentally, socially, or emotionally challenged students, while receiving greater per capita resources. As in Sweden, the United States, and other countries, the spread of such schools has had the net effect of increasing social inequality and undermining overall national educational achievement. Benn contrasts this with the experience of countries that have maintained the most uniform and universal systems -- such as Canada, Finland, and South Korea -- and, as a result, continue to top global measurements of national educational performance. Benn makes the case for a recommitment to a well-funded, nearly universal system of “comprehensive” neighborhood schools. Yet it is difficult to imagine how such an option will attract sufficient political support when inequality continues to increase in most Western democracies, strengthening the powerful special interests arrayed against reform.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

Ross counters with a refreshingly empirical corrective to that myth. Extensive interviews with EU officials reveal a modest and pragmatic mindset. They view the EU as an intergovernmental institution dominated by the wills of its member states. Market reform and enlargement are needed to revitalize Europe, but officials recognize that recent EU efforts in this regard -- the so-called Lisbon agenda and the admission of 12 new member states -- have triggered unexpected problems and public skepticism. Still, most officials reasonably view the legitimacy crisis of the EU mostly as a function of the declining popularity of national governments themselves. True, until the recent financial crisis, Brussels’ elites tended to treat the single European financial market and the euro as successful and stable. Yet in this, they were hardly being more myopic than most business leaders and politicians in the rest of the continent.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."
27,Sexuality in Europe: A Twentieth-Century History,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2012-05-01/sexuality-europe-twentieth-century-history,Sexuality in Europe: A Twentieth-Century History,"In this fascinating history, Herzog narrates Europe’s twentieth-century sexual revolution, citing two decisive causes of change: contraception and pornography. In 1900, only a few courageous activists advocated birth control, an idea rejected by a uniformly hostile public. The ironic result was that political and social authorities glorified brothels as necessary, even family-friendly outlets for frustrated husbands and portrayed prostitutes as naturally more sexually desirable than wives. Through the middle of the century, not only fascists but also conservative democrats blocked access to birth control and discouraged a wider acceptance of pornography. Not until the 1960s did the pill and pornography become widely available. New erotic roles for women, gay people, and others emerged. This was not, Herzog argues, primarily the work of New Left activists but rather the consequence of capitalism, which eroticized advertising, clothing, and popular culture. Ultimately, the tensions between commerce and legal repression grew too great, giving rise to more liberal policies. Yet these battles are not over, even in Europe, where religious and political opposition to contemporary sexual mores are still evident.

Instead, in Leiken's view, the success of national policies intended to integrate second-generation Muslim immigrants varies greatly. The question is why. Ironically, uncritical official tolerance has bred conflict. The British government embraced multiculturalism, encouraging Muslims to form separate enclaves, some of which fostered hostile extremism and even terrorism. France rejected multiculturalism, encouraging Muslims to assimilate. Less terrorism ensued, and the riots in recent years involving young French Muslims have had little to do with Islam or jihad and instead have been responses to unequal access to education and employment. Germany, to which Leiken pays less attention, lies somewhere in the middle. A less experienced observer might be tempted to draw specific policy lessons from this pattern, but Leiken rightly recognizes the importance of factors that are beyond government control: divergent domestic political cultures, the legacies of imperial rule, and the beliefs and attitudes immigrants bring with them from their home countries."
29,The Real Romney,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2012-05-01/real-romney,The Real Romney,"This life of Willard Mitt Romney, former governor of Massachusetts and the current front-runner in the Republican presidential primary, is one of the least substantive, most unsatisfying political biographies to be published in some time. If Romney ever read a book, or was ever influenced by a writer or a thinker, or has ever told a revealing joke, or has ever expressed an opinion about events in another country, Kranish and Helman either do not know about it or chose to keep their knowledge to themselves. It seems clear that Romney did not give these biographers much access; it is also clear that they failed to work their way into his mind. Many will come to this book searching for clues about what kind of man Romney is and what kind of president he would be. But the authors do not have any answers. They fail to explore his intellectual development, his thoughts about social problems and issues, or the ways in which his religious faith has shaped him.

His latest book aims to counter the view of many liberal internationalists that because the United States seeks a liberal order it must eschew traditional great-power diplomacy and power projection. Kagan believes in the value of a liberal, democratic world order and fears that anarchy and chaos will result if this order breaks down. But he argues that the order rests on U.S. military and economic power rather than on the respect that other powers have for noble American ideals. He points out that the United States has often been most successful internationally under leaders who were not particularly beloved by the rest of the world, such as Richard Nixon. In contrast, Woodrow Wilson was greeted by huge and enthusiastic crowds across Europe after World War I but was unable to capitalize on his unprecedented soft power. From Kagan’s point of view, the way to preserve a U.S.-led liberal world order is to tend to the foundations of American power at home and to project that power abroad in a thoughtful and confident manner.

In this crisp and stimulating book, Brzezinski speculates on the dangers that could result from the decline of the United States and offers his prescriptions to restore American leadership in a changing world. Brzezinski argues against the increasing U.S. tendency to write off Europe and concentrate on Asia. He suggests that creative American statesmanship could bring Russia and Turkey into a revived and rejuvenated West, which might help advance the kind of liberal order the United States seeks. He recommends that U.S. policy toward Asia rest on the advantages of being an offshore, maritime power, and that the main U.S. objective in Asia should be the maintenance of a balance of power, much like British policy in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. In the end, his message is reassuring: American decline is eminently preventable. For the United States, he argues, decline is a choice, not a fate.

Along the way, Beinart examines the close relationship between President Barack Obama and the liberal wing of the Jewish community in the United States, considers the failure of the Obama administration’s Israel policy, and analyzes the state of the American Jewish community at a time of assimilation and generational discord. In many ways, the book is an exercise in nostalgia: Beinart would like to re-create the unity American Jews experienced before Israel’s divisive occupation of the Palestinian territories after the Six-Day War, in 1967. Beinart believes that a revival of liberal Zionism would strengthen Jewish identity among younger American Jews who are disenchanted with establishment groups such as the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) and B’nai B’rith. By attempting to cover so many complex and contentious themes in such a short book, Beinart leaves himself vulnerable to critics who can point to occasional slips and flaws.

The conservative gadfly Murray makes the opposite case: lower-income, less-educated whites are increasingly unchurched, unmarried, and unemployed, whereas the upper-middle class is pious, monogamous, and hard working. Coming Apart has been widely criticized for attributing this social breakdown to moral causes rather than placing the plight of the white working class in the context of the economic changes of the last 30 years. Still, the picture Murray paints of a demoralized white working class living in the ruins of once-healthy social institutions is compelling and alarming. The inevitable controversy over Murray's diagnosis should not obscure the need to address the conditions he describes. Whether the root causes are economic, cultural, or a mix of the two, the erosion of social capital among working-class nonimmigrant whites is a problem that cannot be safely ignored."

Broadwell's excellent biography portrays him as a modern exemplar of the soldier-scholar-statesman and one who has exerted a profound influence on the American military establishment. Granted extensive access to the general and his subordinates over a prolonged period, Broadwell has responded with an in-depth examination of Petraeus' remarkable rise in the U.S. Army and of his impact not only on the conduct of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq but also on a new generation of military officers, on whom he has left an indelible mark. Broadwell provides an inside look at Petraeus' interactions with his subordinates and his counterparts in countries allied with the United States. She also details his skillful dealings with the U.S. Congress and the White House, demonstrating the complex workings of contemporary civil-military relations and military diplomacy. All In avoids the pitfall of hagiography, giving voice to critics and dissenters, some of whom claim that Petraeus' career has been more self-serving than selfless, that the Iraq surge was not the decisive turning point his advocates claim it was, and that he has been too invested in counterinsurgency to be objective about its record in Afghanistan. Regardless, Petraeus emerges from Broadwell's book as an educated, committed, competitive, driven, and inspiring figure."

But will we survive it? Seven decades since the development of nuclear weapons began in earnest, their use has been confined to the U.S. bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945. But there have been close calls since then. Meanwhile, remedies such as world government or complete disarmament seem ever more unlikely or utopian. Survival has come to depend on a messy concoction of self-restraint and normative limits, reinforced by a shared instinct for self-preservation. In a subtle analysis of the history of the nuclear order, Walker charts the stresses and strains to which the system has been subjected. Most recently, the main challenge has come from broad power shifts in the international system and the acquisition of nuclear weapons by unstable states. Walker considers measures to shore up the system, such as reforming the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. Yet his basic conclusion is that states will have little choice but to continue to “muddle through.” Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

Given the urgent need to cut the deficit, it should therefore be possible to scale back military spending without damaging national security. O’Hanlon, a leading specialist on military budgets, argues that cuts can be made but should not be too drastic and should not usher in a disengaged foreign policy. China and Russia must be made to understand that the United States will continue to take its security commitments seriously. Meanwhile, the U.S. military must make preparations for potentially dire contingencies in Iran and North Korea without losing sight of its new appreciation for the difficulty of counterinsurgency and state building. Arguments like O’Hanlon’s seem to be reaching policymakers: in January, President Barack Obama announced that the focus of U.S. security strategy would begin to shift away from Europe and the Middle East and toward Asia and the Pacific, and the Pentagon already seems to have accepted the logic of shrinking ground forces.

During the war, U.S. soldiers were fed well, whereas the Japanese were expected to survive on spiritual nourishment. The British system of rationing not only avoided starvation but helped sustain national solidarity. Collingham’s achievement is to reveal the interaction of warfare and agricultural economics, depicting the desperation of the hungry and the casual cruelty of occupation. Of particular note is her treatment of the Nazi leader Herbert Backe’s Hunger Plan, which German leaders used to justify their invasion of Russia on the assumption that Russian land could be used to feed German soldiers while the locals starved. Although this is a thoroughly researched and consistently informative book, Collingham at times exaggerates the impact of food on the war, overemphasizing its ability to explain events and underestimating the influence of other practical factors, such as oil supplies, and harder-to-quantify variables, such as the power of ideology.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

The jihadists profiled in these books seem motivated more by a lust for vengeance than by a desire to create a new political order founded on Islam. Authorities thwarted most of their plots, and some would-be terrorists failed on account of their own incompetence, such as the hapless “shoe bomber” and “underwear bomber.” Both books argue for the importance of intelligence and police work and warn against the folly of casting counterterrorism as a military activity."

Building on that success, scientists have attempted to eradicate other diseases. This volume is a collection of conference papers written mainly for professionals engaged in the complex, multidisciplinary process of disease eradication, which requires the cooperation of thousands of people, including practitioners in small clinics all over the world. The benefits of this laudable decades-long effort are undeniable: endemic measles and rubella have been eliminated from the Western Hemisphere, and researchers in Africa have made important strides against river blindness, a disease caused by a parasitic worm. Of course, frustrating challenges remain. Scientists have long sought to dramatically reduce malaria, but effective countermeasures have proved elusive. Polio, the principal health anxiety of American parents in the mid-twentieth century, had until recently disappeared from all but four countries, down from 119 in 1985.

But the evidence is slim to nonexistent that current copyright provisions actually encourage the useful arts. Most copyrights are owned by monopolistic gatekeepers, such as publishing houses, movie studios, and record labels: well-financed rent seekers that try to limit the royalties due to artists. Patry, a copyright lawyer, mounts an aggressive attack not on the principle of copyright but on the system as it exists today in the United States and also in Europe, where lawmakers bizarrely justify outdated copyright rules as a means of preserving European culture. Patry argues that recent advances in digital technology require a fundamental reexamination of the entire system of copyright. For example, 97 percent of all books published more than 28 years ago are now out of print and inaccessible to the public except through libraries, which are often not close at hand. To his mind, those works should be available online, preferably in the public domain. Although Patry does not say so explicitly, his persuasive arguments suggest that even the “piracy” of copyrighted material often results in more public good than harm.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

Sadly, there is no compelling evidence that more than two decades of multilateral cooperation have stymied money laundering or reduced the prevalence of the other crimes it supports, such as drug trafficking and terrorism financing. Sharman boldly tested the international anti-money-laundering rules by breaking them, setting up shell companies and bank accounts without providing the kinds of documentation required by law. This proved easier to do in the United States and other rich countries than in well-known offshore financial havens, such as the Cayman Islands and Panama. But if the rules are so demonstrably ineffective, why have so many countries implemented them, often at considerable expense? Sharman’s answer is that countries fear that if they fail to do so, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development’s Financial Action Task Force will effectively blacklist them, making it difficult for them to conduct transactions with the world’s leading banks. The evidence suggests that the U.S. federal government ought to apply a similar form of soft coercion to some U.S. states, such as Nevada and Wyoming, where it is all too easy to break the international rules and get away with it.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

Uranium-fueled reactors such as the ones at Fukushima pose a number of problems, including the risky disposal of radioactive waste. According to Martin, thorium is a far superior reactor fuel because it is less radioactive and more abundant than uranium and also produces much less waste. This thorough book details the history of research into thorium reactors. In the 1960s, the United States developed an experimental thorium reactor at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, but the Nixon administration later abandoned the project for budgetary and bureaucratic reasons. Today, the governments of China, India, and Japan are developing thorium reactors, as are private-sector players in South Africa and the United Kingdom. Martin urges the United States to get back into the action, since in his view thorium offers the ideal material for satisfying the world’s burgeoning demand for electricity without relying on fossil fuels.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

That goal is reflected in China’s latest five-year plan (2011–15), as it was in the previous plan. But Lardy, one of the foremost foreign scholars of the Chinese economy, laments how little progress China has actually made toward that objective. China’s government, he argues, must raise domestic interest rates, allow its currency to appreciate, raise energy prices (which are still partially controlled) so that they are closer to global market levels, and finance its impressive, ongoing expansion of the social safety net by directing its profitable state-owned enterprises to pay higher dividends. None of these recommendations is new, but Lardy places them in a coherent and persuasive framework. He speculates that China has yet to take the necessary steps because powerful interest groups benefit from current policies and have strongly and so far successfully resisted significant change. If there is a constructive role for a dominating Communist Party in contemporary China, it is to place the public interest above special interests and push through vital reforms.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

He writes about a world in which the United States makes its foreign policy -- not a world that the United States supposedly still makes. In his view, rising powers are not neatly integrating into a U.S.-dominated world, as if taking their places “on offer” from the United States. He also argues that the changing world order is marked more by a broad diffusion of power than by a classical transition from one great power (the United States) to another (China). The result is not a twenty-first-century version of nineteenth-century multi-polarity but a mosaic of “multiple modernities” rooted in distinct histories and political models. Kupchan is rightfully concerned that uncertain power balances, contested authority, and divergent national interests could produce conflict. Still, he believes that the United States should now be less intent on shaping the world and more focused on adapting to it, in part by being more open to others’ ideas about what constitutes an optimal international order. Moving beyond scholarly debates and election-season paeans to American exceptionalism, Kupchan urges readers to see the world as it is becoming, not how it used to be or how they might like it to be.

The question is upon the method of procuring and administering them.” In this spirit, Ford argues that human rights are best advanced when they are “brought down to earth” and turned into steady, pragmatic efforts to tackle injustice in specific political settings. The book is most impressive in its characterization of the ideas and politics that motivate the loosely organized global human rights movement, which pursues many causes but has not offered a unified, coherent vision of a world governed by international law. Still, Ford believes that the collective efforts of many individual human rights groups have encouraged an increasingly universal belief that no government should be permitted to torture its citizens, suppress dissent, victimize women, or persecute religious minorities.

As economic interdependence has intensified, so, too, have efforts by the United States and other governments to manage and regulate it, leading to an unprecedented growth of international agreements, treaties, and organizations. Although various schools of legal scholarship embrace the idea that international law and institutions will and should play a larger role in American domestic lawmaking, Ku and Yoo seek to defend the sovereign authority of constitutional government. Their book suggests a set of doctrines for U.S. political leaders hoping to resist the encroachments of international law, including “non-self-execution,” which holds that international treaties and other international agreements have the force of law only if Congress acts to implement them. Perhaps the most con-troversial idea the authors advance is a version of legal federalism that would give individual U.S. states the authority to interpret and implement -- or ignore -- international law.

Rothkopf’s chief concern is that the balance between the state and the market has been lost in the United States and the wider liberal democratic world. Beginning in the 1980s, the Washington consensus and the neoliberal emphasis on open markets and deregulation have led to crises and instability, undermining the legitimacy of American power and putting many societies at risk. As the world economy has rapidly globalized and the state has retreated from the market, Western governments have lost the ability to fulfill their obligations to citizens. These changes have transformed the global system into a realm of weakened states and super-empowered elites, in which the world’s richest 1,000 people collectively control assets that are equivalent to those held by the two billion poorest. This is a world out of balance. If Rothkopf’s history is a guide, increasingly complex power struggles will play out in the decades ahead within and between states, regions, and corporations.

The United States, burdened with deficits and debt, is less willing and able to support an open and stable system or to play the role of global policeman. Europe and Japan are also struggling and losing the ability to support an American-led order. Rising non-Western states, such as Brazil, China, and India, are gaining ground and seeking more influence in global affairs, but they are still seized with the problems of development and cannot lead. At the same time, the world is increasingly buffeted by “problems with-out borders,” such as weapons proliferation and global warming. In spite of this disarray in global governance, Bremmer does not foresee traditional conflicts between great powers in the coming era.

Readers will not find a better guide to liberal internationalism and its theoretical rivals than this collection of his writings from the past three decades. Doyle’s primary insight is that relations between liberal democracies tend to be peaceful and that this “separate peace” has provided a foundation for alliances such as NATO and other forms of international cooperation. But Doyle also recognizes that liberal states have not refrained from fighting wars with nonliberal states and have even exhibited a form of international “imprudence” -- for example, during the European colonial wars and in American military interventions during the last century. Several of the essays contrast the classical ideas of liberalism in the writings of Kant, Smith, Locke, Rousseau, and others with the realist alternatives lurking in the shadows of Thucydides. Others explore how the end of the Cold War afforded the United States and other democracies opportunities to strengthen and expand the “international liberal community” and make it the centerpiece of global order. But considering the legacy of George W. Bush’s “freedom agenda,” Doyle concludes that forcible democratization is wrong and self-defeating.

And Indian elites were also encouraged when U.S. President Barack Obama announced, during a 2010 visit to India, that the United States would support India's quest to gain permanent membership on the United Nations Security Council, which would put the country on an equal footing with its longtime rival, China. In recent years, such sentiments have also spread to large segments of the Indian middle class, which, owing to the country's remarkable economic growth in the past two decades, now numbers around 300 million. Nearly nine out of ten Indians say their country already is or will eventually be one of the most powerful nations in the world, an October 2010 Pew Global Attitudes survey revealed."
53,Mafia States,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/mafia-states,Mafia States,"The global economic crisis has been a boon for transnational criminals. Thanks to the weak economy, cash-rich criminal organizations can acquire financially distressed but potentially valuable companies at bargain prices. Fiscal austerity is forcing governments everywhere to cut the budgets of law enforcement agencies and court systems. Millions of people have been laid off and are thus more easily tempted to break the law. Large numbers of unemployed experts in finance, accounting, information technology, law, and logistics have boosted the supply of world-class talent available to criminal cartels. Meanwhile, philanthropists all over the world have curtailed their giving, creating funding shortfalls in the arts, education, health care, and other areas, which criminals are all too happy to fill in exchange for political access, social legitimacy, and popular support. International criminals could hardly ask for a more favorable business environment. Their activities are typically high margin and cash-based, which means they often enjoy a high degree of liquidity -- not a bad position to be in during a global credit crunch."

55,Campaign Tips From Cicero,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2012-04-20/campaign-tips-cicero,Campaign Tips From Cicero,"In 64 BC, the great Roman lawyer and orator Marcus Tullius Cicero ran for consul, the highest office in the republic. Marcus was 42 years old, brilliant, and successful. But he was not a member of the nobility, and that would ordinarily have eliminated him from consideration. The other candidates that year were so unappetizing, however, that he had a chance of winning -- at least, thought his younger brother, Quintus, if Marcus could run a good campaign. At this time in Rome, any adult male citizen could cast a ballot, but voting was done in a complicated system of groups. The richest citizens had disproportionate power, social and political patronage was crucial, and campaigns were accompanied by some bribery and occasional violence, but the electoral process was orderly and usually reasonably fair. The Commentariolum Petitionis, or ""Little Handbook on Electioneering,"" purports to be a memo written by Quintus to Marcus telling him how to proceed. Some scholars believe it is just that; others think it was written by another ancient writer. Either way, the author clearly knew a lot about Roman politics in the first century BC, which turn out to have a distinctly familiar feel. What follows are excerpts from a new translation of the Commentariolum by Philip Freeman, with some observations on its contemporary relevance by James Carville."
56,The Climate Threat We Can Beat,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2012-04-20/climate-threat-we-can-beat,The Climate Threat We Can Beat,"For more than two decades, diplomats have struggled to slow global warming. They have negotiated two major treaties to achieve that goal, the 1992 UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and the 1997 Kyoto Protocol. And last year, at the UN Climate Change Conference in Durban, South Africa, they agreed to start talking about yet another treaty. A small group of countries, including Japan and the members of the European Union, now regulate their emissions in accord with the existing agreements. But most states, including the largest emitters of greenhouse gases, China and the United States, have failed to make much progress. As a result, total emissions of carbon dioxide, the leading long-term cause of global warming, have risen by more than 50 percent since the 1980s and are poised to rise by more than 30 percent in the next two to three decades."
57,Workers of the World Divide,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2012-04-20/workers-world-divide,Workers of the World Divide,"SINCE the middle of the last century, the American labor movement has been in steady decline. In the early 1950s, around one-third of the United States' total labor force was unionized. Today, just one-tenth remains so. Unionization of the private sector is even lower, at five percent. Over the last few decades, unions' influence has waned and workers' collective voice in the political process has weakened. Partly as a result, wages have stagnated and income inequality has increased."
58,Tough Love for Renewable Energy,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/world/tough-love-renewable-energy,Tough Love for Renewable Energy,"Over the past decade, governments around the world threw money at renewable power. Private investors followed, hoping to cash in on what looked like an imminent epic shift in the way the world produced electricity. It all seemed intoxicating and revolutionary: a way to boost jobs, temper fossil-fuel prices, and curb global warming, while minting new fortunes in the process."
59,The True Lessons of the Recession,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2012-04-20/true-lessons-recession,The True Lessons of the Recession,"According to the conventional interpretation of the global economic recession, growth has ground to a halt in the West because demand has collapsed, a casualty of the massive amount of debt accumulated before the crisis. Households and countries are not spending because they can't borrow the funds to do so, and the best way to revive growth, the argument goes, is to find ways to get the money flowing again. Governments that still can should run up even larger deficits, and central banks should push interest rates even lower to encourage thrifty households to buy rather than save. Leaders should worry about the accumulated debt later, once their economies have picked up again."
60,Scoring Obama's Foreign Policy,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/united-states/scoring-obamas-foreign-policy,Scoring Obama’s Foreign Policy,"As November's U.S. presidential election approaches, foreign policy and national security issues are rising in importance. President Barack Obama is running on a platform of ending the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan while demonstrating toughness against al Qaeda. His Republican opponents charge him with presiding over the United States' decline and demonstrating fecklessness on Iran. The true story is somewhat more complicated than either side admits."
61,Baby Gap,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/world/baby-gap,Baby Gap,"For most of human history, high birthrates and high mortality rates tended to balance each other out. That began to change in the nineteenth century, when better sanitation and nutrition lengthened life spans. The world's population surged from about one billion in 1800 to seven billion today."
62,The U.S. Army in a Time of Transition,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2012-05-01/us-army-time-transition,The U.S. Army in a Time of Transition,"After six months as chief of staff, I can see clearly that the coming decade will be a vital period of transition for the U.S. Army. The service will have to adjust to three major changes: declining budgets, due to the country's worsened fiscal situation; a shift in emphasis to the Asia-Pacific region; and a broadening of focus from counterinsurgency, counterterrorism, and training of partners to shaping the strategic environment, preventing the outbreak of dangerous regional conflicts, and improving the army's readiness to respond in force to a range of complex contingencies worldwide."
63,Europe After the Crisis,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/europe/2012-05-01/europe-after-crisis,Europe After the Crisis,"From the start, the euro has rested on a gamble. When European leaders opted for monetary union in 1992, they wagered that European economies would converge toward one another: the deficit-prone countries of southern Europe would adopt German economic standards -- lower price inflation and wage growth, more saving, and less spending -- and Germany would become a little more like them, by accepting more government and private spending and higher wage and price inflation. This did not occur. Now, with the euro in crisis, the true implications of this gamble are becoming clear."
64,The First Global Man,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/review-essay/2012-05-01/first-global-man,The First Global Man,"The last half century has not been kind to Christopher Columbus. Drawing on a study of exhumed skulls from fifteenth-century Europe, an article in the most recent Yearbook of Physical Anthropology found that syphilis, first diagnosed in Europe in 1495, was carried back to the continent by Columbus' crew. Within a decade, the bacterium had spread to European soldiers in India, who then infected Asians, making syphilis the first global epidemic. Once the great explorer, Columbus was now just an agent of venereal disease."
65,America’s Hidden Government,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/americas-hidden-government,America’s Hidden Government,"Over the course of the past century, the American state -- the sum of all government programs and policies -- has grown dramatically larger and more complex. From a massive standing army to an extensive social safety net to significant taxation, from mortgage guarantees to student loans to environmental protections, the range and scale of government activity taken for granted by American citizens today would have been inconceivable to their great-grandparents."
66,Botching the Bomb,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/world/botching-bomb,Botching the Bomb,"The chronic problem of nuclear proliferation is once again dominating the news. A fierce debate has developed over how to respond to the threat posed by Iran's nuclear activities, which most experts believe are aimed at producing a nuclear weapon or at least the capacity to assemble one. In this debate, one side is pushing for a near-term military attack to damage or destroy Iran's nuclear program, and the other side is hoping that strict sanctions against the Islamic Republic will soften it up for a diplomatic solution. Both sides, however, share the underlying assumption that unless outside powers intervene in a dramatic fashion, it is inevitable that Iran will achieve its supposed nuclear goals very soon."

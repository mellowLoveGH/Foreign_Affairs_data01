0,Is Democracy Dying?,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/issue-packages/2018-04-16/democracy-dying,What’s Inside,"Centralization of power in the executive, politicization of the judiciary, attacks on independent media, the use of public office for private gain—the signs of democratic regression are well known. The only surprising thing is where they’ve turned up. As a Latin American friend put it ruefully, “We’ve seen this movie before, just never in English.”"
1,Building a Capable State: Service Delivery in Post-Apartheid South Africa,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2018-04-16/building-capable-state-service-delivery-post-apartheid-south,Building a Capable State: Service Delivery in Post-Apartheid South Africa,"During apartheid, South Africa built local administrations that delivered social services at First World levels to the small white minority, even as they ignored the large black majority. The challenge after apartheid ended, in 1994, was to extend the same quality and quantity of services to the entire population. This lucid and detailed review of local administrations since then argues that they have made a great deal of progress in housing, public transportation, and sanitation. (Local governments are not responsible for education and health, so the authors pay little attention to those areas.) The book depicts an impressive level of pragmatism, dedication, and vision among the decision-makers who achieved this progress. But, the authors argue, officials have not done enough to address major problems of racial and geographic inequality. And the authors’ overall optimism is tempered by their worries about the corruption of President Jacob Zuma’s administration; completing this unfinished agenda is now up to Zuma’s successor, Cyril Ramaphosa."
2,African Dominion: A New History of Empire in Early and Medieval West Africa,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2018-04-16/african-dominion-new-history-empire-early-and-medieval-west,African Dominion: A New History of Empire in Early and Medieval West Africa,"For a long time, Western historians downplayed the influence that West Africa’s precolonial political traditions have had on the region’s modern culture, economics, and politics. Even today, scholars’ understanding of the great West African medieval states remains hampered by weak and sometimes contradictory evidence, essentially limited to a small number of Arab sources, some complementary Portuguese and Spanish material, and what’s left of an important oral tradition. The earliest and most powerful of the kingdoms that emerged in West Africa, based on trading networks along the Niger and Senegal Rivers, were the Ghana, Mali, and Songhai empires, which dominated the region in succession from the eighth century to the sixteenth century. Gomez’s ambitious new study uses the available evidence to construct a remarkably detailed understanding of the rise and fall of these empires. His book is particularly cogent on the cultural, political, and administrative lineages that linked them; the growth of Islam; and the institution of slavery. There are more readable introductions to the region’s history, but none that is better informed."
3,The Next Factory of the World: How Chinese Investment Is Reshaping Africa,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2018-04-16/next-factory-world-how-chinese-investment-reshaping-africa,The Next Factory of the World: How Chinese Investment Is Reshaping Africa,"This book is short on hard data and long on generalizations, but it is nonetheless worth reading because it expresses a popular argument: that China’s growing commercial interest in Africa is fundamentally altering the continent’s business climate and creating the possibility of a manufacturing revolution there. Sun is not concerned with the substantial deals that the Chinese state has brokered with the governments of oil-rich countries, such as Angola. Instead, she focuses on the many Chinese entrepreneurs who are undertaking smaller ventures in Ethiopia, Kenya, Lesotho, and Nigeria. She argues that independent Chinese investors are spearheading the current rapid economic growth in those countries thanks to a willingness to take risks that Western businesses will not. Yet although she tells revealing anecdotes about individual firms, she never provides the kind of systematic data that would make her case convincing. The book is also frustratingly silent on what Chinese investors have done to overcome high labor costs and poor infrastructure, the main constraints on the competitiveness of African manufacturing."
4,Soldiers in Revolt: Army Mutinies in Africa,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2018-04-16/soldiers-revolt-army-mutinies-africa,Soldiers in Revolt: Army Mutinies in Africa,"Most of the literature on African militaries focuses either on the officers or on the relationship between the brass and civilian politicians. Dwyer’s compelling study of mutinies in West Africa, which are growing increasingly common, is welcome because it concentrates on the rank and file and noncommissioned officers, the groups that are most likely to rebel. She shows that insurrections follow a different logic from coups, as mutinies are not typically motivated by a desire for regime change. Instead, soldiers start them to make demands about their material conditions and communicate their unhappiness with specific officers or policies. Dwyer suggests that two factors have increased the frequency of mutinies in recent years. First, the democratization of several countries in the region has spurred all Africans to voice public grievances, and soldiers are no exception. Second, she finds that mutinies are more likely in armies that are involved in international peacekeeping operations, because the extra pay they entail generates greater inequality between ranks and because they present substantially more risk to individual soldiers, which makes them more likely to question the military hierarchy."
5,Congo's Violent Peace: Conflict and Struggle Since the Great African War,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2018-04-16/congos-violent-peace-conflict-and-struggle-great-african-war,Congo’s Violent Peace: Conflict and Struggle Since the Great African War,"Berwouts’ savvy history explores how the Democratic Republic of the Congo has changed since the official end of the war that devastated the country from the late 1990s to the early years of this century. Recent analyses of Congo have tended to discuss either the political dynamics in the capital or the persistent outbreaks of ethnic violence and human rights abuses in the country’s east, with its complex and ever-changing array of armed groups. Berwouts shows how the two are linked. Local ethnic conflicts over land and resources have been exacerbated by a combination of neglect and short-term political manipulation by the Congolese state. Other countries in the region, mostly notably Rwanda, have also stirred up trouble. The predatory, although largely incompetent, regime of President Joseph Kabila has survived for 17 years but failed to build a state capable of promoting development or stabilizing the eastern provinces. Berwouts ends with a pessimistic review of recent popular protests over Kabila’s attempts to grant himself a third term without holding elections. Today, Berwouts believes, Congo is once again facing a descent into violence."
6,China as a Polar Great Power,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2018-04-16/china-polar-great-power,China as a Polar Great Power,"In this study of China’s efforts to become the only nation other than the United States capable of operating comprehensively in both the Arctic and Antarctica, Brady opens up a new frontier of insight into an area of international relations all but ignored by Western scholarship. She draws on a wide range of Chinese sources to offer eye-opening revelations about China’s burgeoning polar activities. Beijing regards the polar regions as vital domains for fishing and shipping and hopes to exploit their rich reserves of energy and minerals. It also plans to use its activities there to grow China’s global influence, something that Washington has encouraged by largely ignoring the issue. Beijing talks little about its polar activities and is deliberately ambiguous when it does, meaning that these moves have drawn little notice outside specialized professional communities. Yet as a component of an ambitious grand strategy laid out by President Xi Jinping, China’s development as a polar great power will shape how the changing global order is governed. Brady’s book provides the best place to start for understanding the genesis, motivations, and dynamics of China’s exploits in the ice."

Over the last five years, Xi has intensified his retreat from reform. A reversal of economic liberalization has led to widening income inequality, calcifying class lines, and an economic slowdown. Instead of advancing fairness in the legal system and transparency in media, Xi has tightened social control so that grievances intensify without finding outlets other than Internet rants, mob violence, and illegal protests. State control of religion drives many believers into underground sects. By concentrating an unprecedented amount of power in himself, Xi is destroying hard-won rules of the political game that contributed to regime stability. All this repression breeds resistance, and resistance breeds further repression, in a cycle that Minzner predicts will end badly."
8,China's Eurasian Century? Political and Strategic Implications of the Belt and Road Initiative,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2018-04-16/chinas-eurasian-century-political-and-strategic-implications-belt,China’s Eurasian Century? Political and Strategic Implications of the Belt and Road Initiative,"Billions of dollars are flowing out of China, as part of the country’s Belt and Road Initiative, to build ports, railways, roads, pipelines, and telecommunications facilities across the Eurasian land mass (the “belt”) and along the coast of the Indian Ocean (the “road”). The physical infrastructure undergirds growing trade, financial, academic, and political networks. Chinese President Xi Jinping’s rhetoric about a wealthy China giving back to the world and win-win cooperation is not without foundation, as hungry governments, not just in the developing world but also in Europe, gratefully soak up Chinese investments. But Rolland’s helpful survey reveals the initiative’s strategic motives, which include providing outlets for China’s excess production capacity and generating a Eurasian center of gravity as a counterweight to U.S. influence in maritime Asia. Rolland speculates that Xi’s long-term vision is to create a world order in which Western-style rule of law and democracy promotion are replaced by deference to Chinese interests and the international application of Chinese “stability maintenance” techniques."
9,India Turns East: International Engagement and US-China Rivalry,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2018-04-16/india-turns-east-international-engagement-and-us-china-rivalry,India Turns East: International Engagement and US-China Rivalry,"Since the early 1990s, most Indian strategists have viewed China as their country’s main security threat. One result has been New Delhi’s cooperation with Washington—halting and ambivalent though it is. Less well known is India’s Look East Policy, formally adopted in 1992, by which New Delhi has sought to increase its economic, diplomatic, and security ties with countries and institutions in East Asia and Southeast Asia. This useful survey finds that the policy has generated a number of joint declarations but only modest programs of defense cooperation, intelligence sharing, and arms sales with partners such as Japan, Singapore, and Vietnam. India signed a free-trade agreement with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and pivoted from suspicion of to engagement with ASEAN’s associated institutions. But India’s attempts to strengthen ties with Australia and Myanmar have been hampered by both countries’ reluctance to antagonize China. Indeed, India itself does not want to confront China. Grare cautions that the Look East Policy does not offer the congruence with U.S. strategies that some Washington policymakers like to imagine."
10,Making Money: How Taiwanese Industrialists Embraced the Global Economy,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2018-04-16/making-money-how-taiwanese-industrialists-embraced-global-economy,Making Money: How Taiwanese Industrialists Embraced the Global Economy,"One crucial element of Taiwan’s economic success, which began in the 1960s—and equally of its economic slowdown, which started in the 1990s—was the agility of its small and medium-sized “contract manufacturers,” firms that produce consumer products for U.S. brands such as Apple and Timberland but have no brand names of their own. By studying the Taiwanese entrepreneurs who built these firms, Hamilton and Kao shed light on the relationship between globalization and the Asian economic miracle. These entrepreneurs sprang out of the countryside in response to the needs of the growing U.S. consumer market. They drew on family and social networks for capital, labor, and parts suppliers and to help organize production. Whether making cell phones or footwear, the best of these firms have adjusted to changing market conditions, repeatedly innovating their product lines and production methods. This was a boon for Taiwan. But as the island developed, the costs of labor and parts went up, and many Taiwanese entrepreneurs moved their production to China. (Some firms are now leaving China for Southeast Asia and even, in some cases, the United States.) As these companies departed, the Taiwanese economy slowed. Nevertheless, Taiwanese-owned firms remain among the top contract manufacturers in the world."

That makes today’s international system not multipolar, as most analysts believe, but bipolar. But he argues that today’s bipolar system differs from that of the Cold War because of geographic differences between Europe and Asia. Chinese and U.S. forces do not face each other on land, the way that Soviet and U.S. forces did, so Tunsjo considers a direct superpower confrontation less likely than it was during the Cold War. Proxy wars are also less likely, because China’s security concerns are primarily regional rather than global. But he sees a high risk of conflict in maritime East Asia, where today’s superpowers both have vital interests. His views provide valuable nuance for the growing number of analysts who are worried about the strategic implications of China’s rise."
12,Authoritarian Advance: Responding to China's Growing Political Influence in Europe,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2018-04-16/authoritarian-advance-responding-chinas-growing-political,Authoritarian Advance: Responding to China’s Growing Political Influence in Europe,"This pathbreaking report investigates the ways in which China seeks to shape politics and public opinion in Europe. The Chinese Communist Party uses governmental and ostensibly private wealth in overt and covert ways to influence political and economic elites, the media and public opinion, and civil society and academia. Some European states have begun to adopt a stance of “preemptive obedience” to Chinese interests on issues such as human rights. The authors name some of China’s “willing enablers,” including former British Prime Minister David Cameron, who took a post with a Chinese-sponsored infrastructure investment fund after leaving office, and former French Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin, who accepted a role in a Chinese cultural-exchange foundation. To protect the integrity of Western systems without violating their character as liberal democracies, the report recommends screening Chinese investments, banning foreign support for political parties, providing help to poorer EU members that are vulnerable to Chinese financial pressure, and promoting transparency for universities, media organizations, and politicians that accept Chinese support. The report also covers similar patterns in Australia and New Zealand, where Chinese influence efforts are even more advanced, and in the United States, where they are expanding rapidly."

Four decades later, she is a molecular biology professor at the University of California, Berkeley, an investigator with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, and a researcher at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. One of the discoverers of CRISPR, a powerful new technology for gene editing, Doudna tells the story of the current genetics revolution in her gripping new memoir, A Crack in Creation (written with Samuel Sternberg).

The book is built on interviews, U.S. government records, and the work of other historians, but not Saudi Aramco’s archives. Its most original parts deal with the Saudi government’s “long game” to gain full control of Aramco while avoiding outright nationalization. That project was completed in 1980, when, after decades of gradually increasing its influence over the company, the government acquired the entire firm. In the resulting arrangement, Aramco owned the expertise, but the kingdom owned the oil it produced. Throughout Aramco’s history, Saudi Arabia has always found a way to make money selling oil, shape world petroleum prices, and avoid lasting confrontation with the United States. Even the 1973 embargo of oil exports to the United States, imposed by the Arab members of OPEC in retaliation for U.S. support of Israel during the Yom Kippur War, did not do long-term damage to the U.S.-Saudi alliance."

Before the 1970s, the West viewed Islam as a spent force, but then in the middle of that decade, militant jihadists became active in Egypt, and in 1979, the Islamic Republic of Iran was born. Subsequently, Western governments saw Islam as an integral part of politics, but they never solved the riddle of how to embrace it, and the United States never broke with any of its more secular authoritarian allies. As Frampton demonstrates, the United Kingdom and the United States never treated the Brotherhood as more than a possible tactical ally in the struggle against communism or as a bulwark against more extreme forms of Islam. There were exceptions, such as the British historian H. A. R. Gibb, who preferred the Brotherhood to military dictators in Egypt, but they were few and far between. Despite what many Egyptians believe, there is little evidence that the United States has actively sought to bring the Brotherhood to power."
16,Iraq and the Politics of Oil: An Insider's Perspective,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2018-04-16/iraq-and-politics-oil-insiders-perspective,Iraq and the Politics of Oil: An Insider’s Perspective,"Vogler, a former ExxonMobil executive, recounts the seven years he spent on and off in Iraq between 2003 and 2015 working to rebuild the oil sector. Most of the book deals with his on-the-ground experiences, offering considerable detail about the main Iraqi and foreign actors, but it ends on a more provocative note. By 2014, Vogler had become convinced that the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq was driven in large part by a plan worked up by Ahmed Chalabi, the head of the Iraqi National Congress, and a cluster of neoconservative policymakers in the Bush administration. The aim of the plan was to reopen a pipeline from Kirkuk, in Iraq, to Haifa, in Israel, that had been closed since Israel’s founding in 1948 and which would provide Israel with a major source of oil and substantial transit fees. Ultimately, this quixotic scheme never saw the light of day. The most likely explanation is that the White House viewed it as a possible dividend of the invasion, but not as a major impetus for going to war."

Zahidi, a member of the Executive Committee of the World Economic Forum, is one of them. In this lucid presentation, she draws on 200 interviews to depict an inexorable march forward for Muslim women, who are set to make up over 30 percent of the global Muslim work force by 2030. Zahidi feels no need to mount an Islamic defense of women’s right to work and argues that for now, Muslim women should avoid directly confronting the patriarchy. For a time, they will have to do it all: absorb most of the domestic work and master the job market. The Internet, the gig economy, and the traditional extended family can all make the transition easier. So can governments, by improving Internet access for women, promoting education, providing more public transport, reforming workplace rules, and more."

The brutality, greed, and cynicism of the leading actors led one refugee to say, “I’ve reached a point in my life where I hate everything. I am disgusted by humanity.” Another, contemplating the rise of al Qaeda and the Islamic State (also known as ISIS), explained, “You are in dire need for a narrative that can justify the futility.” The excerpts follow the major stages of the violence as experienced by the refugees: the peaceful revolution, the government’s violent response, the meat grinder of aerial assault and prison torture, the flight abroad, and the process of starting anew. The observations of Assad supporters, religious extremists, and members of foreign proxies, such as Hezbollah, are missing. But that is unsurprising: refugees are not likely to be loyalists."
19,Rival Power: Russia in Southeast Europe,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2018-04-16/rival-power-russia-southeast-europe,Rival Power: Russia in Southeast Europe,"Bechev introduces a sophisticated and cool-headed corrective to the crude image of Russian foreign policy favored by much of the Western press. He focuses on Russia’s relations with four areas of southeastern Europe: the post-Yugoslav republics, Bulgaria and Romania, Greece and Cyprus, and Turkey. Russia’s engagement with those countries has little to do with Slavic identity or a desire to fulfill imperialist dreams. Instead, its approach is highly pragmatic and focused on dealmaking, particularly on energy. The other countries are playing the same game. Moscow is eager to increase its influence and, especially at the moment, to damage that of the West, but in the end, the Kremlin is mindful that these countries are in Europe’s backyard, not its own. The concluding portion of the book focuses on three critical dimensions of Russia’s approach to the region: security relations, particularly with NATO members; the ups and downs of energy projects; and the nature and use of its soft power."

This “purge of the purgers,” as Viola terms it, came after Stalin called off the Great Terror in 1938. Those who had carried out the two mass operations in 1937–38 against former “kulaks” (supposedly well-off peasants), foreigners, and “anti-Soviet” and “socially dangerous” elements—sending almost 1.5 million people to either the gulag or execution—were themselves put on trial. In 1939, nearly a thousand of them were arrested; many were subjected to torture—the very crime for which a lot of them were being tried. After elaborate trials, they were either sentenced to death or the gulag or sent to the front during World War II. Viola draws from Ukraine’s secret police archives—which, unlike Russia’s, are open—to detail how the accused defended themselves, the testimony against them, and the outcomes. As well as lifting the cover from this less well-known part of the story, Viola explains in great detail the interaction between what was commanded from above and what flowed from forces at the ground level."
21,My Life as a Spy: Investigations in a Secret Police File,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2018-04-16/my-life-spy-investigations-secret-police-file,My Life as a Spy: Investigations in a Secret Police File,"From 1973 to 1988, Verdery, an anthropologist, spent a total of nearly four years conducting field research in Nicolae Ceausescu’s Romania. Over that time, Romania’s security service amassed an impressive file on her, totaling 2,781 pages in eight volumes. She got ahold of it in 2008 and has spent much of the time since then dealing with its impact on her. The resulting book is an extraordinary exploration of her research, reexperienced through the eyes of those who surveilled her. Believing her to be a spy, the security services built up a wildly distorted picture of her, which she terms her “doppelgänger.” Rather than reflexively dismiss this double, she agonizes over its reality, its challenge to her identity, and its implications for her profession. The most dramatic portion of the book centers on her struggle to understand those who informed on her, particularly those she counted as close friends, a few of whom she has confronted face to face. Coming from such a distinguished academic, Verdery’s brutally honest description of herself, including as a naive and careless young scholar, is stunning. Few books reflect so frankly and so powerfully on the nature and complications of an academic career."

The Jews were welcomed when they arrived in the area and prospered for many years. But they suffered their first mass slaughter during a Cossack and peasant uprising in 1648. The next massacre took place three decades later, at the hands of Ottoman forces. Despite these atrocities, the Jews remained a dominant group within the town’s elite. Partly for that reason, they were almost never free from the resentment and enmity of their Polish and Ukrainian neighbors. At the heart of the book are the tragic events of the twentieth century. Bartov recounts the fate of the Jews as German and Russian troops marauded through their town in World War I and during the successive German and Soviet invasions of World War II, ending with the final Soviet offensive of 1944–45. His account of this last nightmare is specific and personal. There are moments of humanity in the story, but they appear only as bright specks in a very dark stone."

As a diplomat, he played a key role in rebuilding the Bosnian military after the war; in negotiating the Ohrid Agreement in 2001, which averted a civil war in Macedonia; and in the failed effort to avoid the 1998–99 Kosovo war. He provides a compelling, detailed account of the diplomatic give-and-take with wily Balkan leaders (none more so than Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic), debates among Western negotiators, and the crosscutting pressures from Brussels and Washington. His portrait of Richard Holbrooke, the controversial but skilled American diplomat, at work during the Dayton negotiations is particularly powerful. Pardew puts the reader in the room during his encounters with several major actors, including Milosevic, both in Holbrooke’s company and, later, alone. He acknowledges some of the shortcomings of Washington’s policies in the Balkans, but he makes a strong case that U.S. diplomacy ended the Bosnian genocide and prevented further bloodshed."

Putin and his loyalists certainly are corrupt, but he and the liberal technocratic economic team on which he relies have also skillfully managed Russia’s economic fortunes. As Miller recounts in this short and admirably clear book, Putin took over a debt-ridden, revenue-starved economy in 1999 and then forced the oligarchs to pay taxes, saved the windfall from soaring oil profits (and later used it to weather successive financial crises), paid off Russia’s debts, tamed inflation, and presided over rapid growth (fueled not only by oil profits but also by increased productivity). Russia, Miller argues, has a dual economy: one portion dominated by corrupt and inefficient state-owned enterprises, the other driven by a widening range of efficient and innovative private companies. He sketches a “hierarchy of Putinomics”: “first, political control; second, social stability; third, efficiency and profit.” The first two objectives are within reach, but the system’s inability to properly fund the country’s health-care and educational systems, fight corruption, or establish the rule of law threatens to sacrifice the third."

Kaplan rejects this idea and finds that under certain circumstances, local communities can protect their members from civil strife. He bases his hopeful conclusion primarily on his extensive field research in rural Colombia; using secondary sources, he also finds local islands of peaceful civilian autonomy within conflict zones in Afghanistan, the Philippines, and Syria—suggesting that even in extreme circumstances, civilians can organize to keep themselves safe. Successful strategies include building early warning systems to allow people to escape the fighting, opening dialogues with armed groups, and threatening to publicize acts of extreme violence. To discourage retaliation, communities must avoid openly sympathizing with one side or the other. So Kaplan warns U.S. policymakers against counterinsurgency or democracy-promotion strategies that could put the intended beneficiaries at risk by undermining their claims to neutrality."

The conclusion he draws from his three detailed case studies, of Brazil, Colombia, and Mexico, is that governments that launch all-out military campaigns provoke drug cartels to respond with their own brutal, escalatory attacks against the state, catching innocent bystanders in the crossfire. Such indiscriminate official crackdowns are misconceived because, as Lessing points out, the cartels do not aim to usurp state power—they are not political insurgents. They instead seek to dissuade the state from using overwhelming force to destroy them. A more rational approach for governments, he argues, is to adopt policies, such as offering lower prison sentences and imposing more calculated levels of repression, that give cartels incentives to behave more peacefully, even if that means tolerating drug trafficking and official corruption."

Thus, it was very much in character when, during the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign, he confronted the Republican candidate Donald Trump over his anti-immigrant posture, before Trump had one of his security guards expel Ramos from the room. Ramos’ book pulls no punches, denouncing Trump for stirring up racism to gain political power and for causing undocumented immigrants and their families to live in constant fear. (Ramos also criticizes President Barack Obama for failing to advance immigration reform.) Despite the rise of Trump, Ramos remains an optimist, proud to live in a country of freedom and opportunity and confident that the coming demographic transformation—by 2044, Latinos will make up a quarter of the U.S. population—will push aside xenophobia in favor of tolerance. Ramos fills out the book with his ruminations on the immigrant experience: the challenges of reconciling multiple identities and recalling fading memories."

This study of the history of pro- and anti-Israel ideas among American Christians from the Colonial period to the present day challenges the stereotypes that often distort discussions of Christian Zionism and offers useful observations about one of the most important political forces in American life. It is not, Goldman points out, only fundamentalist and dispensationalist Christians who support Israel. Nor is Christian support for Israel solely the product of a set of beliefs about Israel’s role in the approach of Armageddon. Pro-Zionist positions are widely shared across different strains of American Christianity. Mormons, who most fundamentalists and dispensationalists dismiss as misguided heretics, are among Israel’s staunchest backers. And many of Israel’s most prominent Christian supporters, including Martin Luther King, Jr., and the Protestant theologian Reinhold Niebuhr, were neither fundamentalist nor conservative."

They have a point. “I am not so simple to think,” wrote Jamestown’s Captain John Smith about England’s North American possessions, that “any other motive than wealth will ever erect there a commonweal.” The settlers who founded Plymouth Colony were much less important than their legend suggests. The more commercially oriented settlements of Boston and Massachusetts Bay soon eclipsed the struggling Pilgrim community. By overemphasizing the idealists and ignoring the pragmatists and opportunists in American history, patriotic historians often mislead their audiences. But that isn’t the whole story; in the seventeenth century, as now, people’s motives were often mixed. The Pilgrims were less otherworldly, and adventurous merchants were less cynical, than superficial observers might conclude."

Meijer’s biography punctures this caricature. Vandenberg, who had his full share of both the vices and the virtues of Midwestern Republicanism in the middle of the twentieth century, will not be remembered as a great figure in U.S. history. But his evolution from a prewar isolationist to a committed Cold Warrior reflected the dramatic changes in American thought that enabled the United States to make the post–World War II era such a peaceful and progressive one. His powerful articulation of a bipartisan approach to foreign affairs, summed up in his 1947 injunction to his fellow senators to “stop partisan politics at the water’s edge,” sounds quaint today, but few doubt that a return to even a limited bipartisan foreign policy consensus would strengthen the United States’ voice in world affairs."

By the late 1970s, when Brzezinski rose to prominence, the old well-heeled and well-bred WASP foreign policy establishment had imploded under the strain of the Vietnam War and yielded to a new elite from more diverse backgrounds. Both Brzezinski, whose father was a Polish diplomat stranded in Canada by the Nazi conquest of Poland and then the Soviet-backed communist takeover of 1945, and his friend and rival Henry Kissinger, whose family fled Nazi persecution in Germany, possessed a gift for strategic vision that few of their American-born contemporaries could match. Into a foreign policy community increasingly composed of technocrats, political scientists, and area specialists, Brzezinski and Kissinger brought a more generalist and historical perspective. Of the two, Kissinger has always been the better known and the more controversial. Vaïsse’s evenhanded appraisal of Brzezinski’s contributions to U.S. foreign policy will help redress the balance and will introduce a new generation of readers to a great American strategist."

Those opinions aren’t particularly original or particularly rare, but this book distinguishes itself by its literary quality and its intellectual breadth. Most anti-Trump literature acknowledges the economic concerns of Trump’s supporters and suggests that establishment politicians need to address them. Frum goes significantly further. He shows awareness of, and even sympathy for, their cultural grievances and their sense of dislocation. The book would be even better, and perhaps less alarmist, if Frum had looked more closely at the history of populism in the United States. Although quack economics and racism frequently accompany populist uprisings, populism has sometimes served as a useful corrective to out-of-touch elites. The Trump phenomenon should drive political observers on both sides of the aisle to deepen their understanding of populism, not to pander or surrender to it but to think intelligently about how to channel populist energy toward constructive reform."
33,The West Point History of the American Revolution,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2018-04-16/west-point-history-american-revolution,The West Point History of the American Revolution,"The essays in this authoritative collection illuminate the origins and conduct of the American War of Independence, with a particular focus on the transformation of the Continental army under George Washington into a professional and disciplined fighting force—a crucial achievement, even though Washington lost many of the battles he fought. After weighing all the factors that contributed to the revolutionaries’ eventual victory, including Great Britain’s long supply lines, Stephen Conway concludes that the foreign interventions by France, the Netherlands, and Spain mattered most. In one of his contributions, Watson examines the wider social and political contexts of the Revolution, as well as the role played by developments in weaponry and the art of war. The special value of this book lies in its splendid presentation: it features excellent illustrations, maps, timelines, and charts, as well as reproductions of key documents and letters."

After years of grueling trench warfare had caused many to doubt that the conflict would ever end, the rapid success of the Allied offensive came as a surprise to those who led and fought in it. Hart enlivens his lucid account of this final battle with quotes from memoirs, letters, and diaries. He shows how increased professionalism and better tactics allowed British and French troops, fortified by the arrival of the U.S. Army, to push back the German forces. He also opens a window into the minds of individual soldiers, relating how they accepted the possibility of death and their relief at the eventual armistice. As one wrote: “Do you realise that we shall probably live to be old men!”"

He has spent time not only among their designers and operators but also with those so alarmed by the prospect of machines making life-and-death decisions that they wish to ban them—or, at the very least, impose strict limits on their use. In this comprehensive analysis, Scharre moves beyond the clichés of “killer robots” to explore the complexity of human-machine interactions, distinguishing systems that still partly rely on humans from those that are completely autonomous and highlighting the importance not only of machines’ capabilities but also of human fallibilities. Scharre recognizes the advantages of remote-control systems and doubts whether it would be possible to craft and enforce a ban. But he also warns against being “seduced by the allure of machines—their speed, their seeming perfection, their cold precision.” New technologies are most likely to reduce the harm caused by war if they incorporate the principles of proportionality and discrimination, which are already central to the established laws of armed conflict."

After escaping to London via Spain, he was recruited by the Special Operations Executive, the British espionage and irregular warfare service, and returned to France to sabotage the German war effort and gather intelligence. His expertise in plastic explosives led to a number of early successes. But as his network of agents expanded, some betrayed him; others cracked under torture. Eventually, La Rochefoucauld himself was captured and brutally interrogated. Having failed to extract any information from him, the Germans sentenced him to death. The book’s most dramatic sequences describe his escape from the truck that was taking him to his execution and his subsequent journey back to London. He returned to France again just before D-Day, was caught again, and escaped yet again to carry out even more sabotage behind German lines."

Lansdale ran a range of covert operations to weaken communist influence in the country and encouraged Diem to do more to earn the respect of his people. Lansdale was wary of the use of brute force, and his early career in advertising had given him an interest in the psychology of warfare. His efforts in South Vietnam gained him a reputation as a man who did his best to understand the countries in which he operated and who looked for innovative ways to undermine insurgencies. He urged the United States to support Diem, and when Diem was assassinated, in 1963, he considered it a disaster. After Diem’s death, Lansdale despaired over the persistent corruption of the new South Vietnamese leaders whom he was attempting to build up. In this sympathetic and revealing biography, Boot draws on his past work on guerrilla warfare to argue that adopting Lansdale’s “hearts and minds” approach might have caused less pain. But Boot is properly cautious, declining to firmly conclude that such a strategy would have resulted in a different overall outcome."
38,Winning Together: The Natural Resource Negotiation Playbook,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2018-04-16/winning-together-natural-resource-negotiation-playbook,Winning Together: The Natural Resource Negotiation Playbook,"For decades, a history of mutual suspicion and recrimination between Mexico and the United States stymied cooperation on three resources that cross national land and sea boundaries: the water of the Colorado River and the oil and gas buried beneath the Gulf of Mexico. In 2012, after several years of negotiations, the two countries finally reached breakthrough agreements on both issues, which Verdini treats as case studies in successful international dealmaking on environmental issues and national resources. His book generalizes from the agreements to draw broader lessons about how to switch international bargaining from a zero-sum framework to one of cooperation for mutual gain. In both these cases, that shift was made possible partly by crises (a Mexican earthquake, a drought in the western United States and Mexico, and the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf), but even more by poor national management of common resources, which showed both countries that they could benefit from working together. Verdini fills the book with applied wisdom about international negotiation, but it is unclear to what extent the lessons of bilateral negotiations can be extrapolated to multilateral ones."
39,Bioinformation,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2018-04-16/bioinformation,Bioinformation,"Who owns an individual’s personal medical information? In the past, the privilege of accessing that sensitive data belonged solely to patients, their doctors, and, perhaps, laboratories. Today, such information is often made much more widely available for scientific research and even for commercial use by pharmaceutical firms, particularly in the form of “big data” for studies that seek to find previously unknown patterns—a trend that is only likely to increase. This slim but informative book describes the sources of what the authors call “bioinformation” and the current and possible future beneficial uses of such data, such as identifying patients whose genes make them particularly susceptible to certain adverse medical conditions. Parry and Greenough also explore the ethical implications of using and sharing the data, including the possibility of privacy violations and other abuses, such as using health information to stigmatize groups of people. They close with a discussion of possible legal and institutional frameworks that would maximize the benefits and minimize the harms of large-scale medical data collection."

After spending years writing about trends in countries’ GDP growth as a journalist, the author has discovered what GDP actually means and how it is measured. His research has left him appalled that he and others—journalists, commentators, and politicians—have been extolling GDP growth for so long. It is not that growth itself is a delusion: after all, it has been associated with increases in living standards and reductions in poverty in many countries over the past half century. But growth often becomes a fetish for politicians and policymakers, who have given it priority over many other aspects of national well-being. This informative and sometimes humorous book serves as a useful antidote to that myopia. When it comes to the economy, Pilling argues, officials and leaders should pay a little more attention to quality and a little less to quantity."

Luckily, the sun provides more energy to the earth in an hour than humanity currently consumes in a year. But how long will it take to develop the technology and systems needed to truly harness solar power, and how much will doing so cost? Sivaram’s enlightening and candid book describes both the enormous progress that has already been made in exploiting solar energy in its two major forms—photovoltaic and concentrated solar power—and the major obstacles to further progress. The author worries that existing silicone-based photovoltaic solar panels will “lock out” those made with newer, cheaper, and more effective materials, such as perovskite. Sivaram, a scientist with practical experience advising city governments on energy policy, argues that solar power cannot realize its full potential without significant innovations in power generation, power storage, grid management, financing, and regulation. All of these are achievable with sufficient imagination and money, so he pleads for more R & D funding and fewer subsidies for existing solar installations."

By the 1930s, the basic debate seemed to have been settled: ever since then, every U.S. president has publicly supported trade liberalization and negotiated trade agreements. According to Irwin, this policy has served the U.S. economy and the average American household extremely well. His book will serve as an authoritative reference on U.S. trade policy and its effects on trade patterns for years to come, and it usefully corrects several common misconceptions, such as the idea that Alexander Hamilton was a protectionist and that the Smoot-Hawley tariffs imposed in 1930 caused the Great Depression. The Trump administration’s controversial new tariffs on steel and aluminum, which rely on a little-used national security justification, even though they will hit U.S. allies the hardest, were announced after the book was published."

This well-researched and insightful book represents the best effort yet to assess the impact of the BRICS, as the group of countries is known. For those who saw the BRICS as a new bloc that would take on the Western liberal order, the results have been disappointing. Several of the countries have fallen on hard economic times, and their interests have often failed to align. But the authors argue that, despite these problems, the grouping is not just an exercise in symbolism. Through trial and error, the BRICS have found a way to cooperate in what the book calls “financial statecraft” to achieve larger foreign policy goals. They have built new institutions, such as the New Development Bank and the Chinese-led Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, and they have successfully pushed for reforms to the old Bretton Woods system and amplified their own voices within it. What unites these countries, the authors conclude, is less a common vision of a new world order than a “common aversion” to Western hegemony."

Yet not all periods of economic hardship generate populist revolts, and not all populist revolts succeed. Eichengreen shows that populism tends to thrive most when economic insecurity exposes the divergent interests of the people and the elites. Societies become particularly ripe for populist backlashes in the wake of financial crises that lead to bailouts for plutocrats. But governments can push back against the populist tide. In the 1880s, German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck undercut populist worker revolts by establishing social welfare programs, and U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt’s New Deal promoted economic security and shared prosperity after the Great Depression. Yet in the United States, the government’s ability to respond to populist grievances by strengthening the social safety net and reducing income inequality has been undermined by the antipathy to government enshrined in the country’s political DNA—a phenomenon clearly visible in the nascent Trump era."

But Jentleson reminds readers that leaders do matter. He looks across the twentieth century to identify 15 “transformational” people who bent the flow of politics in the direction of peace and reconciliation. They include the U.S. diplomat Henry Kissinger and the Chinese leader Zhou Enlai (for their roles in the United States’ opening to China), U.S. Presidents Woodrow Wilson and Franklin Roosevelt (for their work building international institutions), and Mahatma Gandhi, Lech Walesa, and Aung San Suu Kyi (for their efforts to advance freedom and protect human rights). Jentleson observes that there is no single recipe for good political leadership, but many of the figures had some common traits, including “personal capital” (derived from strong bonds with a community and a reputation for personal courage or moral conviction), an abundance of political skill, and the ability to use the right combination of carrots and sticks to enlarge the space for compromise. None of the leaders he profiles was without flaws, but each found a moment when his or her charisma, wit, or rugged determination helped move history forward."

The triumphalism that flourished after the Cold War was misplaced, but so, too, in Galston’s view, is today’s pessimism. The populism and polarized politics unsettling Western democracies reflect deep shifts in modern industrial society, including growing divisions between urban and rural populations, failed policies on immigration, and stagnant middle-class incomes. But Galston argues that these problems can be addressed through an enlightened reform agenda oriented toward shared prosperity: worker education, progressive tax reform, the expansion of social insurance, and investment in infrastructure. Liberal democracy, he points out, requires balancing competing principles—the market and democracy, freedom and equality, action and constraint—and so it is doomed to disappoint many citizens. And because modernity constantly generates new challenges, liberal democracy will always struggle to keep up. But Galston provides a reminder that the system’s great virtue, compared with its authoritarian, theocratic, and socialist rivals, is its ability for self-reflection and correction. Galston is betting that the democratic spirit is still alive."
47,Why Liberalism Failed,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2018-04-16/why-liberalism-failed,Why Liberalism Failed,"Western democracies are in trouble, grappling with rising inequality, lost confidence in government, fraying social fabrics, and intense political divides. What has brought on this crisis? In this provocative book, Deneen argues that modernity itself has failed. Today’s predicament is the inevitable result of flawed ideas laid down by thinkers such as Niccolo Machiavelli, Francis Bacon, Thomas Hobbes, René Descartes, and John Locke, who together inspired the Enlightenment and modern liberal democracy. These theorists, Deneen argues, rejected classical and Christian efforts to foster virtue and instead premised their secular visions of politics on a less lofty view of the individual as motivated by pride, selfishness, greed, and the quest for glory. On this basis, Western liberal democracies have grown powerful and wealthy but have also experienced the corrosive effects of untrammeled self-interest. Social bonds and traditional values have disappeared, and citizens feel threatened by the growing power of a distant state. Deneen argues for a retreat into smaller units: family, church, and local communities. Yet it is precisely this world of private life and civil society that liberalism has sought to protect."

Scholars, policymakers, lawyers, and activists have asked that question ever since the contemporary human rights movement emerged after World War II. At any given moment, headlines supply plenty of reasons for skepticism. Today, the news is full of reports of Rohingya refugees fleeing a campaign of murder, rape, and dispossession in Myanmar; drug users dealing with brutal, state-sponsored vigilantism in the Philippines; and immigrants and minorities facing the wrath of extreme right-wing and populist movements in European countries and the United States. It is easy to succumb to a sense of despair about the laws and institutions designed to protect human rights."

But despite the deadly potential of biological weapons, their actual use remains rare and (mostly) small scale. Over the last several decades, most states have given up their programs. Today, no country is openly pursuing biological weapons."

But with the development of CRISPR (which stands for “clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats”), a method for editing DNA far more precisely and efficiently than was possible with older technologies, fiction has edged closer to reality. CRISPR exploits an ancient system that allows bacteria to acquire immunity from viruses. It uses an enzyme called Cas9 to cut strands of DNA at precisely targeted locations, allowing researchers to insert new genetic material into the gap."

This good news may come as a surprise, but there is plenty of evidence for it. Since the early 1990s, global child mortality has been cut in half. There have been massive reductions in cases of tuberculosis, malaria, and HIV/AIDS. The incidence of polio has decreased by 99 percent, bringing the world to the verge of eradicating a major infectious disease, a feat humanity has accomplished only once before, with smallpox. The proportion of the world’s population in extreme poverty, defined by the World Bank as living on less than $1.90 per day, has fallen from 35 percent to about 11 percent."

In recent years, Myanmar (also known as Burma) had been mostly a good news story. After decades of brutal dominance by the military, the country had seen the main opposition party, the National League for Democracy, score an all-too-rare democratic triumph, winning the 2015 national elections in a landslide. The NLD’s leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, an internationally celebrated dissident who had received the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize for her efforts to democratize Myanmar, became Myanmar’s de facto head of state. Many analysts and officials concluded that the county was finally on the path to democratic rule. Support poured in from Western democracies, including the United States. Myanmar had long been isolated, relying almost exclusively on China, which was content to turn a blind eye to human rights abuses. Now, many hoped, Suu Kyi would lead the country into the Western-backed international order."
53,Globalization Is Not in Retreat,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/world/2018-04-16/globalization-not-retreat,Globalization Is Not in Retreat,"By many standard measures, globalization is in retreat. The 2008 financial crisis and the ensuing recession brought an end to three decades of rapid growth in the trade of goods and services. Cross-border financial flows have fallen by two-thirds. In many countries that have traditionally championed globalization, including the United States and the United Kingdom, the political conversation about trade has shifted from a focus on economic benefits to concerns about job loss, dislocation, deindustrialization, and inequality. A once solid consensus that trade is a win-win proposition has given way to zero-sum thinking and calls for higher barriers. Since November 2008, according to the research group Global Trade Alert, the G-20 countries have implemented more than 6,600 protectionist measures."

From 2000 to 2016, more Americans died of overdoses than died in World War I and World War II combined. Yet even these grim numbers understate the impact of opioid abuse, because for every person who dies, many more live with addiction. The White House Council of Economic Advisers has estimated that the epidemic cost the U.S. economy $504 billion in 2015, or 2.8 percent of GDP."

It was October 2017, and the Chinese leader was addressing the 19th Party Congress, the latest of the gatherings of Chinese Communist Party elites held every five years. In his three-and-a-half-hour speech, Xi, who was appointed the CCP’s general secretary in 2012, declared his first term a “truly remarkable five years in the course of the development of the party and the country,” a time in which China had “stood up, grown rich, and become strong.” He acknowledged that the party and the country still confronted challenges, such as official corruption, inequality in living standards, and what he called “erroneous viewpoints.” But overall, he insisted, China was headed in the right direction—so much so, in fact, that he recommended that other countries draw on “Chinese wisdom” and follow “a Chinese approach to solving the problems facing mankind.” Not since Mao Zedong had a Chinese leader so directly suggested that others should emulate his country’s model."

In an article for the Journal of Democracy titled “Democracy’s Third Wave,” Huntington pointed out that the two previous waves of democratization, from the 1820s to the 1920s and from 1945 to the 1960s, had been followed by “reverse waves,” in which “democratic systems were replaced . . . by historically new forms of authoritarian rule.” A third reverse wave was possible, he suggested, if new authoritarian great powers could demonstrate the continued viability of nondemocratic rule or “if people around the world come to see the United States,” long a beacon of democracy, “as a fading power beset by political stagnation, economic inefficiency, and social chaos.”"
57,Autocracy With Chinese Characteristics,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/asia/2018-04-16/autocracy-chinese-characteristics,Autocracy With Chinese Characteristics,"Sooner or later this economy will slow,” the New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman declared of China in 1998. He continued: “That’s when China will need a government that is legitimate. . . . When China’s 900 million villagers get phones, and start calling each other, this will inevitably become a more open country.” At the time, just a few years after the fall of the Soviet Union, Friedman’s certainty was broadly shared. China’s economic ascent under authoritarian rule could not last; eventually, and inescapably, further economic development would bring about democratization."
58,The End of the Democratic Century,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2018-04-16/end-democratic-century,The End of the Democratic Century,"At the height of World War II, Henry Luce, the founder of Time magazine, argued that the United States had amassed such wealth and power that the twentieth century would come to be known simply as “the American Century.” His prediction proved prescient: despite being challenged for supremacy by Nazi Germany and, later, the Soviet Union, the United States prevailed against its adversaries. By the turn of the millennium, its position as the most powerful and influential state in the world appeared unimpeachable. As a result, the twentieth century was marked by the dominance not just of a particular country but also of the political system it helped spread: liberal democracy."
59,The Age of Insecurity,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/united-states/age-insecurity,The Age of Insecurity,"Over the past decade, many marginally democratic countries have become increasingly authoritarian. And authoritarian, xenophobic populist movements have grown strong enough to threaten democracy’s long-term health in several rich, established democracies, including France, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United States. How worried should we be about the outlook for democracy?"
60,The Big Shift,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2018-04-16/big-shift,The Big Shift,"As Americans struggle to make sense of a series of uncomfortable economic changes and disturbing political developments, a worrying picture emerges: of ineffective politicians, frequent scandals, racial backsliding, polarized and irresponsible news media, populists spouting quack economic remedies, growing suspicion of elites and experts, frightening outbreaks of violence, major job losses, high-profile terrorist attacks, anti-immigrant agitation, declining social mobility, giant corporations dominating the economy, rising inequality, and the appearance of a new class of super-empowered billionaires in finance and technology-heavy industries."
61,Perception and Misperception on the Korean Peninsula,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/north-korea/2018-04-05/perception-and-misperception-korean-peninsula,Perception and Misperception on the Korean Peninsula,"North Korea has all but completed its quest for nuclear weapons. It has demonstrated its ability to produce boosted-fission bombs and may be able to make fusion ones, as well. It can likely miniaturize them to fit atop a missile. And it will soon be able to deliver this payload to the continental United States. North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong Un, has declared his country’s nuclear deterrent complete and, despite his willingness to meet with U.S. President Donald Trump, is unlikely to give it up. Yet Washington continues to demand that Pyongyang relinquish the nuclear weapons it already has, and the Trump administration has pledged that the North Korean regime will never acquire a nuclear missile that can hit the United States. The result is a new, more dangerous phase in the U.S.–North Korean relationship: a high-stakes nuclear standoff."
62,The Right Way to Coerce North Korea,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/north-korea/2018-04-01/right-way-coerce-north-korea,The Right Way to Coerce North Korea,"When it comes to North Korea, U.S. President Donald Trump’s policies have been whiplash inducing. On February 23, he appeared to be gearing up for a conflict when he said that if sanctions against Pyongyang didn’t work, Washington would have to move to “phase two,” which could be “very, very unfortunate for the world.” But just two weeks later, Trump abruptly changed course and accepted an invitation to meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un—a decision that caught even his own White House and State Department by surprise."
63,Fresh Prince,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/middle-east/2018-03-19/fresh-prince,Fresh Prince,"It is not often that a Ritz-Carlton becomes a detention facility. But last November, when a large slice of the Saudi elite was arrested on accusations of corruption, the luxury hotel in Riyadh became a gilded prison for hundreds of princes, billionaires, and high-ranking government officials. Behind this crackdown was the young crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, also known as MBS, who is attempting to remake the kingdom’s economy and social life, and even the House of Saud itself."

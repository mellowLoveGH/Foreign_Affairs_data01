1,Hack Job,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/review-essay/2017-04-17/hack-job,Hack Job,"Today’s cyberbattles could almost make one nostalgic for the Cold War. The nuclear arms race created a sense of existential threat, but at least it was clear who had the weapons. In contrast, a cyberattack could be the work of almost anyone. After hackers broke into the U.S. Democratic National Committee’s servers in 2016 and released e-mails embarrassing to the DNC’s leadership, the Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said the attacker could be China, Russia, or “somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds.”"
2,Why Comrades Go to War: Liberation Politics and the Outbreak of Africa’s Deadliest Conflict,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2017-04-14/why-comrades-go-war-liberation-politics-and-outbreak-africas,Why Comrades Go to War: Liberation Politics and the Outbreak of Africa’s Deadliest Conflict,"The two Congo wars that shook sub-Saharan Africa between 1996 and 2003 constitute a tragedy of mind-boggling proportions, with casualties in the millions. Much effort has gone into explaining the wars’ causes. Area experts have tended to focus on complex local dynamics that resist theorizing. Political scientists and economists, meanwhile, have emphasized more generic problems, such as the looting of the failing state’s natural resources and the grievances caused by the exclusion of ethnic groups from power and prosperity. Roessler and Verhoeven avoid the either-or trap. In their telling, the First Congo War saw the replacement of the “neocolonialist” Mobutu regime with a “neoliberation” state inspired by socialist, pan-African ideals. The second war broke out when former allies—the “comrades” of their book’s title—turned against one another in a fight to secure the spoils of victory. This fascinating book is both analytically sharp and empirically rich, drawing on a vast amount of primary-source research, including scores of interviews with various high-level protagonists."
3,Understanding Zimbabwe: From Liberation to Authoritarianism,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2017-04-14/understanding-zimbabwe-liberation-authoritarianism,Understanding Zimbabwe: From Liberation to Authoritarianism,"In the years immediately following the Lancaster House Agreement of 1979, which converted Rhodesia (in which the white minority ruled through repression) into Zimbabwe (in which the black majority gained power through elections), the country was widely considered a success story: it was even referred to as “the breadbasket of Africa.” But in the 1990s, the country descended into a prolonged economic and political crisis that continues to this day, with the dictatorial regime of Robert Mugabe barely clinging to power. Dorman’s excellent history of the postindependence era explains this reversal of fortune by focusing on the increasingly contentious relations between the regime and organized factions within society. Rather than view the Mugabe regime as merely personalistic, Dorman argues that the state progressively ratcheted up its repression as economic failures began to undermine its traditional (and ongoing) strategies of buying off key segments of the population and pacifying others with patriotic appeals that glorified the regime’s anticolonial origins."
4,"Living by the Gun in Chad: Combatants, Impunity, and State Formation",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2017-04-14/living-gun-chad-combatants-impunity-and-state-formation,"Living by the Gun in Chad: Combatants, Impunity, and State Formation","Chad’s history is littered with violence, from the wars fought among its precolonial kingdoms in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries; to France’s “pacification” campaigns, which ran from the 1890s until the 1920s; to the country’s postcolonial history of rebellions at home and participation in regional conflicts. In her insightful book, Debos argues that pervasive violence has fostered a soldiering culture that now permeates the country and that has normalized armed violence, even in times of peace. For Chadian boys with few viable employment prospects, learning to use a gun counts as job training. Debos provides powerful evidence that ideological commitments and ethnic grievances motivate Chad’s fighters less than their simple need to make a living. In periods of relative peace, when their skills are less in demand, these hired guns readily turn to banditry. Sitting atop this mess is Chadian President Idriss Déby, whom Debos portrays as an amoral kingpin who has nevertheless managed to curry favor with the West in recent years by offering support for French and U.S. military actions in the region."
5,A Fraught Embrace: The Romance and Reality of AIDS Altruism in Africa,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2017-04-14/fraught-embrace-romance-and-reality-aids-altruism-africa,A Fraught Embrace: The Romance and Reality of AIDS Altruism in Africa,"Swidler and Watkins spent the better part of two decades studying foreign aid programs in Malawi, especially those addressing the country’s HIV/AIDS crisis. They have produced a savvy and insightful book that focuses on the actors involved and the culture in which they operate and, refreshingly, pays remarkably little attention to policies and organizational charts, which are the usual focus of such studies. Through detailed ethnographic observation of the workshops, training sessions, and monitoring and evaluation exercises in which foreign aid personnel interact with aid recipients, the authors reveal how miscommunication bedevils people who make good-faith efforts to work together but who have different interests and values and face many constraints. Swidler and Watkins zero in on the importance of the local brokers who inevitably emerge as intermediaries between donor officials and recipient communities. The brokers’ effectiveness and commitment help determine the success of aid projects, but donors too often misunderstand, neglect, or antagonize them. This is a deeply empathetic book that explains the failures of foreign aid even as it celebrates the idealism, generosity, and courage of those who deliver it."
6,Madame President: The Extraordinary Journey of Ellen Johnson Sirleaf,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2017-04-14/madame-president-extraordinary-journey-ellen-johnson-sirleaf,Madame President: The Extraordinary Journey of Ellen Johnson Sirleaf,"This enjoyable and highly readable biography of Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, the president of Liberia and one of the three winners of the 2011 Nobel Peace Prize, is at its best when it gives voice to Sirleaf’s fellow Liberians. Cooper, a Pulitzer Prize–winning journalist for The New York Times, captures the local patois exceptionally well, with its odd syntax and curious expressions (“to know book” is to be an educated person). The book doubles as a fascinating account of the two murderous civil wars that racked Liberia between 1989 and 2003. Cooper argues that Sirleaf owes her electoral victories in 2005 and 2011 to the women of Liberia, among whom she enjoys enormous popularity. Her success in office has rested on an unusual combination of a good local reputation and excellent contacts in the West, many of which she acquired during a career spent in international banking prior to her entry into politics—a background that came in handy when renegotiating Liberia’s crushing debts after the civil wars. Still, Cooper makes clear that no amount of goodwill or connections can overcome all the challenges of running a dirt-poor, postconflict country with a long history of poor governance."
7,To Build a Free China: A Citizen’s Journey,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2017-04-14/build-free-china-citizens-journey,To Build a Free China: A Citizen’s Journey,"Xu is one of many Chinese who have imagined a better political future for his country and one of the few sent to prison for working toward this goal as a legal advocate. While awaiting his release, scheduled for later this year, a number of his friends have published this accomplished, engaging translation of his writing. The book provides fascinating details about Xu’s life, his ideas, and his civic campaigns and sheds light on the experience of the disadvantaged and exploited in China. Xu’s most recent and boldest initiative invited people to envision themselves as free citizens in a legal system that uses “rights talk” but often treats them as subjects, denying them the protection of the law. Using social media and techniques inspired by movements such as Occupy Wall Street, Xu’s New Citizens Movement called out the Chinese Communist Party for corruption that enriches elites and for denying equal access to education for rural and migrant children. “Revolution,” Xu predicted in 2013, “will break out in the blink of an eye.” But when he is released, he will find China an even more repressive country and the world a darker, more uncertain place."
8,"Ascending India and Its State Capacity: Extraction, Violence, and Legitimacy",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2017-04-14/ascending-india-and-its-state-capacity-extraction-violence-and,"Ascending India and Its State Capacity: Extraction, Violence, and Legitimacy","Political scientists are increasingly returning to the discipline’s original fascination with the state as an institution, but today they use more sophisticated empirical tools than the discipline’s founders did. Ganguly and Thompson searched far and wide for the best measures of the three key components of state capacity that they list in their subtitle. When the measures are applied to India, the findings are informative but not surprising: India is an “in-between power,” with high regime legitimacy, low extractive capacity, and weak control over violence. They assess the state’s ability to overcome its deficiencies by comparing India’s economic, social, and political circumstances with those of previous rising powers and contemporary competitors. The sobering conclusion they reach is that for India to achieve its potential, a great deal would have to change in the country’s inefficient bureaucracy, corrupt and reform-resistant politics, deficit-ridden budgeting process, fragile infrastructure, and weak educational and health-care systems."
9,A Most Enterprising Country: North Korea in the Global Economy,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2017-04-17/most-enterprising-country-north-korea-global-economy,A Most Enterprising Country: North Korea in the Global Economy,"Hastings details the ingenious ways in which North Korea has conducted foreign trade despite its political isolation. In the 1970s, the country’s diplomatic missions used smuggling, counterfeiting, and weapons trafficking to cover their expenses and send money home to support the ruling Kim family’s lifestyle. In the 1990s, after assistance from the Soviet Union dried up, Pyongyang’s overseas missions and trading companies sold heroin, methamphetamines, and counterfeit cigarettes. In addition, North Korea supplied missile technology to Pakistan in exchange for nuclear weapons technology, and Pyongyang’s diplomats in Europe acquired equipment for the country’s nuclear program from companies in Austria and Germany. Even after the UN levied sanctions against North Korea in 2006, state companies disguised as private firms found ways to access weapons technology and equipment from suppliers all over the world; Chinese and Taiwanese brokers were especially helpful. Meanwhile, Pyongyang lost control over ordinary citizens’ economic lives, so they, too, have taken up smuggling and human trafficking across the Chinese border, a process that contributes to a rising tide of petty corruption. The Stalinist state is rotting from within, but its economy is doing fairly well."
10,Vietnam’s Communist Revolution: The Power and Limits of Ideology,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2017-04-14/vietnams-communist-revolution-power-and-limits-ideology,Vietnam’s Communist Revolution: The Power and Limits of Ideology,"The Vietnamese are usually seen as consummate realists, opportunistically switching alignments among China, Russia, and the United States in order to maintain maximum autonomy. But Vu makes a strong case that ideology has frequently guided Vietnam’s foreign policy, at some cost to the national interest. Examples include lining up with the socialist camp at the start of the Cold War, tilting toward China during the early Sino-Soviet split, escalating the war in South Vietnam in the 1960s, aligning with the Soviet Union in the 1970s, and pushing socialist transformation in the South after unification. One can construct realist explanations for these decisions. But Vu’s deep study of party documents and memoirs makes clear that Vietnam’s leaders, at a minimum, used ideology as a conceptual tool for analyzing issues, as a weapon in policy debates, and as a language for justifying decisions. The collapse of the Soviet Union and tensions with China have demolished the internationalist component of Vietnamese ideology, leaving Vietnam free to define socialism in whatever way suits its national interest."
11,Populist Authoritarianism: Chinese Political Culture and Regime Sustainability,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2017-04-14/populist-authoritarianism-chinese-political-culture-and-regime,Populist Authoritarianism: Chinese Political Culture and Regime Sustainability,"Tang offers an intriguing explanation for one of the biggest puzzles in contemporary China. There are many protests over pollution, land seizures, unpaid wages, and the like, yet surveys show high levels of public support for the central government. Some analysts think Chinese respondents are afraid to say what they really think, but Tang explores nearly two dozen of his own and other scholars’ surveys to show that respondents are not censoring themselves. The puzzle of high regime support is partly explained by nationalism and economic optimism. But Tang suggests an additional factor: Beijing encourages locally focused demonstrations and petitioning in order to keep in touch with public sentiments, and central authorities require local officials to respond to citizens’ demands. In Tang’s view, demonstrations do not signal a legitimacy crisis; instead, they help generate legitimacy, which Tang suggests they may do even more effectively than democratic elections and a stronger legal system because they put officials in direct touch with citizens. The case remains circumstantial, however."
12,The Souls of China: The Return of Religion After Mao,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2017-04-14/souls-china-return-religion-after-mao,The Souls of China: The Return of Religion After Mao,"Johnson practices what might be called “slow reporting”: a form of patient watching, listening, and asking that produces deep insight into China’s multifaceted religious revival. He sits with a Christian prayer group, practices Taoist meditation, participates in a raucous yet spiritual mountain pilgrimage, and attends burial rites. As a curious foreigner, he is welcomed by Chinese hosts who graciously instruct him on their idiosyncratic beliefs. His deft descriptions of these encounters distill the results of broad scholarly research with gentle humor and quiet emotion. Chinese Muslims and Christians—especially Protestants, who number in the tens of millions—are forging their own understandings of faiths that are centered abroad. The religions with longer histories in China—Buddhism, Taoism, and folk religion—are short on theology by Western standards but long on ritual practices. In all these faiths, the Chinese are struggling to rediscover or reimagine their traditions across the historical chasm of the Mao years. For the time being, a fragile mutual tolerance prevails between the repressive state and a wounded society yearning for meaning."

Drawing on numerous interviews and reporting trips, he has put together a striking portrait of a weakening and confused West and a rising but troubled Asia. The power shift is the culmination of a long historical process that will not be derailed even if China suffers a temporary economic or political setback. This has led many analysts to argue that the United States must either yield primacy to China or fight a war that at most could delay the shift but not reverse it. Rachman’s view is more nuanced. Unlike the Western powers, which are united by common values, he argues, the Eastern ones are culturally fractured and rife with strategic mistrust, especially of China. Moreover, financial systems and other features of the international order will remain “wired” through the West so long as rising Asian powers fail to provide reliable rule of law. If Washington can skillfully manage its relations with China—by no means a sure thing—the United States will not have to match China’s GDP or fleet size to maintain a strong position in Asia. Informed on history and up to date, the book is a sprightly, pointed primer on world affairs."
14,Debriefing the President: The Interrogation of Saddam Hussein,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2017-04-14/debriefing-president-interrogation-saddam-hussein,Debriefing the President: The Interrogation of Saddam Hussein,"Nixon spent 13 years as an Iraq analyst for the CIA. When U.S. forces captured Saddam Hussein a few months after the 2003 invasion of Iraq, Nixon and a colleague were tasked with “debriefing” the dictator—in other words, questioning him in order to gain intelligence. Nixon’s book is informed by those conversations and examines Saddam’s life and reign, U.S. policy in Iraq, and the role of the firebrand Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr in post-Saddam Iraq. Nixon believes that the invasion was a mistake, but that view appears to have little to do with his interrogations of Saddam. Nixon acknowledges Saddam’s misdeeds but also puzzlingly asserts that “no one knew better the dreams and desires of Iraqis.” He sees Sadr as a lasting force in Iraqi politics but does not spend much time explaining why. Nixon also complains of an “era of analytic mediocrity” at the CIA, which he associates with the tenure of Director George Tenet. During that period, Nixon argues, the agency allowed itself to become a tool of presidential agendas."

They number somewhere around 40 million, with the biggest populations in Iran, Iraq, Syria, and Turkey. Significantly, much of the territory where large concentrations of Kurds reside is rich in oil and gas reserves."

Wood, a national correspondent for The Atlantic, is a gifted storyteller who tracks down jihadist interlocutors around the world. Fishman, a fellow at West Point’s Combating Terrorism Center, is a diligent analyst and chronicler of the Islamic State (or ISIS). He presents the players and the events in impressive detail, without always offering quite enough guidance on what to think about them. Both authors have much to teach readers. They agree that ISIS and its sympathizers are not heretical zealots; their devotion is not a form of false consciousness. Their practice and understanding of Islam, although extreme and rejected by the vast majority of Muslims, nonetheless qualify as a form of Islamic orthodoxy. Both writers identify the practice of takfir—the act of declaring whole swaths of Muslims (frequently Shiites) to be apostates—as perhaps the most important feature of ISIS’ brutal version of jihad."
17,Milosz: A Biography,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2017-04-14/milosz-biography,Milosz: A Biography,"This is the English translation of Franaszek’s fine biography of Czeslaw Milosz, the great Polish poet and 1980 Nobel laureate. Milosz embodied as much as any Pole the spirit, the tortured twentieth-century history, and the artistic sensibility of his country, even though he spent close to 30 years teaching literature at the University of California, Berkeley. Franaszek, with exquisite balance, blends Milosz’s life story with his intellectual and aesthetic journey, enriching both with perfectly chosen fragments from his poetry and other writings. Milosz was born in 1911 to a well-off Lithuanian family, trained as a lawyer, and became a serious poet in his 20s. He lived a peripatetic life, displaced at first by war, later by professional ambition, then briefly by service as a diplomat representing communist Poland, and then by flight to the West—only to return to Poland for the last ten years of his life, which ended in 2004. He was not only, as Joseph Brodsky said, “one of the greatest poets of our time, perhaps the greatest,” but an intermediary whose translations brought the twentieth-century masters of Polish poetry to international acclaim. In Milosz’s life, so well illustrated by Franaszek, poetry’s confrontation with history converged with the poet’s engagement, sometimes mystical, with humankind’s most basic values."
18,Dictators Without Borders: Power and Money in Central Asia,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2017-04-14/dictators-without-borders-power-and-money-central-asia,Dictators Without Borders: Power and Money in Central Asia,"Corruption is no mere nuisance; it can suffuse a country’s core institutions and dominate political life. On this subject, Russia gets all the attention, but virtually every post-Soviet state, with the exception of the Baltics, is as bad or worse, especially the five Central Asian states of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. In this relentless exposé of corruption in the region, Cooley and Heathershaw detail the looting of state coffers, bribery on a massive scale, a labyrinth of opaque means for hiding assets abroad, and the ways in which corrupt elites use their wealth not only for personal excess but also to amass ever more political power. Such revelations, however, are not the authors’ primary purpose. Instead, they are intent on highlighting the extent to which the corruption of authoritarian rulers in these countries relies on the complicity of outside abettors, including Western lawyers, banks, and even courts, and how such collusion erodes the power of international norms and institutions. That pernicious impact on global governance makes this subject salient and this book important."
19,"Violence as a Generative Force: Identity, Nationalism, and Memory in a Balkan Community",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2017-04-17/violence-generative-force-identity-nationalism-and-memory-balkan,"Violence as a Generative Force: Identity, Nationalism, and Memory in a Balkan Community","Some years ago in Kulen Vakuf, a small rural community on the border between Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, neighbor set upon neighbor, and in several bloody weeks, roughly 2,000 men, women, and children were slaughtered in barbaric fashion. The year was 1941—although readers might have assumed a date five decades later. Bergholz, a historian, stumbled across a blue folder in a Sarajevo archive containing some startling details about the episode and set out on a long quest to piece the whole story together. Croatian militias began the violence; Serbian and Muslim insurgents responded. But the bloodletting was not simply an explosion of long-simmering ethnic hostilities; neither was the violence ginned up by scheming politicians. Putting this beastly case under the microscope, Bergholz probes the role that ethnic identity played. He discovers that strong ethnic identification was often a product of violence rather than a source; that ethnic identities were shifting before, during, and long after the nightmare; and that the rigid ways in which people tend to think about ethnicity in cases like this misleads more than illuminates."
20,Lenin on the Train,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2017-04-14/lenin-train,Lenin on the Train,"In most histories of the Russian Revolution, Vladimir Lenin’s return from exile in western Europe to Russia in the crucial month of April 1917—ensconced by the German high command in a sealed train, “like a plague bacillus,” as Winston Churchill later put it—figures as a footnote. But Merridale uses it as a focal point, recounting in fascinating detail the eight-day journey from Switzerland, across Germany, through Sweden, and down through Finland to St. Petersburg, weaving in the tumultuous events unfolding simultaneously in Russia and in the revolutionary movement abroad. With verve, she assembles a vast panorama of players and brings to vivid life the drama and chaos of a world collapsing and a tragic future forming. The Lenin who rushes into this maelstrom comes off here as no less driven and brutal than in other biographies, yet he also appears to be more genuinely charismatic and, in some ways, more mundane. Merridale sees echoes in recent events of the ruinously myopic behavior of players and powers that stormy winter."

The two sides and the hapless states caught in between have treated this conflict as a zero-sum game; the result has been a negative-sum game, with all parties suffering net losses. The authors trace the many discouraging strands of this story with great care. In their telling, NATO enlargement, the 1998–99 Kosovo war, the so-called color revolutions in former Soviet states, the failure of the Obama administration’s “reset” with Russia, and the Ukrainian crisis compose a pattern of mutually destructive behavior that transcends the significance of any one event. Hence, their recommendations do not offer a specific solution to the conflict in Ukraine; rather, they focus on how Russia and the Western powers might get back to constructing the kind of inclusive, jointly fashioned European-Eurasian order they once championed, at least in words."

They also assess a growing array of policy interventions that are proving effective in combating this scourge, although progress remains very uneven across and within countries. Some of their recommendations echo the conventional wisdom that guides U.S. antipoverty programs: for example, that well-informed social workers can play a vital role in encouraging the poor to access public assistance, and that policymakers must recognize the importance of helping poor people overcome psychological obstacles such as hopelessness and depression. The authors emphasize the importance of quantifiable results and call on governments to seek out cost-effective “tweaks,” coordinate poverty-reduction efforts across public agencies, and design programs that will be consistent with budgetary resources and bureaucratic capabilities. Public policies, they argue, should also align with a country’s social contract and shared political vision: an easy goal to affirm in theory, but one that is too often elusive in practice."
23,Beyond the Scandals: The Changing Context of Corruption in Latin America,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2017-04-14/beyond-scandals-changing-context-corruption-latin-america,Beyond the Scandals: The Changing Context of Corruption in Latin America,"Contrary to popular perceptions that Latin American corruption is only getting worse, Casas-Zamora and Carter argue the opposite: corruption is becoming easier to expose, publicize, and punish. Latin America is experiencing a healthy rebellion against endemic corruption, especially among the educated and informed middle classes. Many factors have contributed to a new public morality: international agreements that establish higher standards of conduct; stiffer transparency and accountability laws; tough, well-equipped prosecutors; aggressive, independent journalists; watchful social-media users; and indignant, mobilized civil society organizations. Economic downturns have also reduced tolerance for the flagrant misuse of public funds. Casas-Zamora and Carter find that a battery of legal and institutional innovations are slowly making progress against entrenched habits of opacity, patrimonialism, and malfeasance. Today, gross violations are more likely to be uncovered and successfully prosecuted: even presidents and top-level corporate executives are no longer safe. This study includes useful reviews of major corruption scandals—often involving government procurement or the financing of political parties and campaigns—in Brazil, Chile, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, and Panama."
24,Four Seasons in Havana,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2017-04-14/four-seasons-havana,Four Seasons in Havana,"Four Seasons in Havana introduces the novelist Padura’s Havana Quartet series of crime thrillers and his legendary detective and (one suspects) alter ego, Mario Conde, to a mass viewing audience. This magnificent, evocative Netflix miniseries was filmed in large measure in Havana, co-produced by Cuban and Spanish companies, and adapted for the screen by Padura and his wife, Lopez Coll. Conde, played by Jorge Perugorría, is middle-aged and emblematic of his politically disenchanted generation: he looks back with nostalgia at his more idealistic youth, drinks and smokes heavily, and jumps without commitment from one woman to another. But he nevertheless retains his sense of personal integrity and his courage. The books and the miniseries faithfully portray Havana’s working-class milieus, whose inhabitants have become accustomed to surveillance, opportunism, and official corruption. “Guys who rob and get away with it piss me off,” Conde declares as he uncovers illicit behavior in high places: collusion in drug trafficking, the misuse of offshore business accounts, the theft of confiscated assets. Postrevolutionary Cuba, it seems, is not quite as exceptional as its apologists—and critics—contend."

In the early 1970s, Carol abandoned a comfortable suburban life and migrated with young Peter to a communal cooperative in Berkeley, California (where her path briefly crossed my own). Later, she brought Peter along as she sought out more intense political struggles in shantytowns and poor rural communities in Chile during the ill-fated government of Salvador Allende and in the highlands of Lima, Peru (breeding grounds of the guerrilla movement the Shining Path). Drawing on Carol’s extensive, reflective diaries and his own sharp memories, Andreas paints vivid, mostly empathetic portraits of the many grass-roots activists they encountered. Eventually, Carol’s radical feminism bumped up against Latino Leninism; identity politics clashed with class struggle. She retreated to her homeland but remained passionately engaged in local political struggles until her death in 2004. Rebel Mother is a warm, tender tale of protective love and codependency in a mother-son pair living in extreme circumstances. Carol’s ultimate triumph: both Peter and an older brother, Joel, have grown up to become creative, purposeful scholars."

China faces a long road ahead as it searches for ways to forge mutually advantageous strategic partnerships with the major Latin American countries. China’s status as a relative newcomer to the region makes its commercial relationships with the four countries studied here very much a work in progress. Chinese business executives and diplomats are struggling to adjust to fast-paced local political currents, and they have already been forced to learn from painful mistakes. Xu cogently argues that to up its game, China will have to devise more sophisticated political risk assessments. Sometimes, callous Chinese state-owned enterprises must figure out how to honor local codes of social responsibility if they want to maintain their access to lucrative business opportunities. If China is to forge genuine strategic partnerships, it will have to match its hunger for the region’s natural resources with a greater willingness to import value-added products and invest in infrastructure and industry in the region."

Similar forecasts have been issued like clockwork almost since the birth of the EU. Yet over the decades, European democracy has not collapsed, war has not broken out, the frequency of terrorist acts has declined, and Europeans have increasingly come to see Christianity as no longer essential to their national identities. Even the great wave of refugees that swept into Europe in 2015 has already crested, with the number plummeting over the past year and a half, in large part due to EU policies. With the exception of the United Kingdom, no member state has really contemplated exiting the EU, and even the British are now negotiating to retain as many EU policies as possible. So perhaps readers should not be surprised that, in his brief conclusion, Kirchick reverses course, tells some optimistic stories, and suggests that perhaps “the end” is not quite here yet. Europe, it seems, might still be saved."

Written by one of the most eminent historians of Germany, it imposes a coherent schema on the story of Europe during a period of 100 years bookended by two massive wars. In this period, Evans argues, every country encountered similar political, economic, social, and cultural challenges, even if the timing and details of their specific responses varied. In his lively, fact-laden, and nuanced prose, Evans focuses on the relentless quest for power by nations, classes, political leaders, scientists, economic actors, artists, and everyday individuals. The search for power transformed everything, from the most intimate acts in the bedroom to the creation of empires."

Although it might have benefited from more quantitative analysis, this is an insightful account of the referendum and its paradoxical consequences. A British government committed to leaving the EU is now trying to preserve almost all the policies the United Kingdom enjoys under the union, except in a somewhat less advantageous form. A vote largely against globalization has empowered the government to propose extreme deregulation and trade liberalization. Labour voters have helped ensure a seemingly permanent Conservative majority. Even deeper contradictions result from a new style of politics characterized by disillusion with established parties and the naive popular belief that referendums are the most directly “democratic” of political institutions. In fact, direct voting promotes British nationalism in a way entirely at odds with the United Kingdom’s distinctive tradition of parliamentary representative democracy. Government by referendum undermines genuine popular control wherever the public proves itself both ignorant and manipulable. And now, politicians will be able to duck responsibility for the negative effects of the choice to leave the EU and blame the public instead."

Descended from King William IV and one of his mistresses, Dorothea Jordan, Norwich has served as a successful diplomat, appeared as a popular radio show host, helped lead the World Monuments Fund and many other charitable causes, and authored more than 20 books. The most recent of these is a popular history of four great kings born between 1491 and 1500. The Spanish Habsburg Charles V was named Holy Roman emperor before coming closer than any pre-Napoleonic leader to conquering all of Europe. He tangled with Francis I of France, a true Renaissance prince who patronized the arts and launched an overseas empire. In an unprecedented act for a Christian king, Francis sided with Suleiman the Magnificent, who ruled over the Ottoman Empire at its political and cultural height and fought his way to Hungary before dying at the gates of Szeged. As the English are wont to do, King Henry VIII stood apart from European squabbles. In order to resolve marital disputes, he famously renounced Catholicism and founded the Church of England. The fates of these four intertwined as they befriended and opposed one another in efforts to dominate Europe. In the end, however, none succeeded in imposing dynastic control and religious conformity, and ever since, European states have been united only in their diversity."
31,The Novel of the Century: The Extraordinary Adventure of “Les Misérables”,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2017-04-14/novel-century-extraordinary-adventure-les-miserables,The Novel of the Century: The Extraordinary Adventure of “Les Misérables”,"Although ostensibly a work of historical fiction, Victor Hugo’s Les Misérables is in fact a panoramic exposé of mid-nineteenth-century France—a society defined by its contradictions. The splendid memory of Napoleon Bonaparte remained omnipresent, yet his mediocre nephew Napoleon III headed the state. Extraordinary new wealth was everywhere, yet so, too, was abject poverty. Rich men profited handsomely by criminal and immoral means, including the promotion of dangerous industrial labor, corruption, prostitution, imperialism, and even slavery. As Bellos shows, such contradictions found expression in Hugo’s own life and career. Although the novel’s hero, Jean Valjean, rails against injustice from atop Parisian barricades, Hugo himself led a company of soldiers against the revolutionaries of his own time. Similarly, having written nearly 2,000 pages that movingly described the plight of the poor, Hugo sold temporary publication rights to Les Misérables for an advance of $5 million in current dollars—arguably the highest amount ever paid for a work of fiction. This unique and readable book conveys the chaotic fabric of French life two centuries ago more powerfully than most conventional histories."

In the wake of the 9/11 attacks, senior members of the George W. Bush administration sold the war as vital to counterterrorism, counterproliferation, democracy promotion, and Middle East peace. It is unclear whether they believed any of that. French President Jacques Chirac, along with some other European leaders, strongly opposed the war. In this book, Bozo relies on official documents and interviews with insiders to reconstruct how Paris viewed these developments. At the time, pundits on both sides of the Atlantic spilled much ink on France’s purported anti-Americanism and principled stance against U.S. “hyperpower.” Yet behind the scenes, Chirac’s opposition was almost entirely pragmatic. He tried hard to avoid a direct confrontation with Washington and warned Bush that “war will have catastrophic consequences, including on terrorism throughout the entire world.” Bush rejected his advice with disdain. Yet ironically, the invasion eventually brought the Americans and the French closer—if only to cope with its disastrous consequences. Today, Paris may be Washington’s most constant ally in the fight against terrorism, spearheading pressure for decisive military action in Libya, Mali, and elsewhere."

Like the earlier work, the new one is an essential read for anyone who seeks to understand the development of U.S. national strategy. After the Napoleonic Wars, the United Kingdom relied on its sea power, its manufacturing strength, and the gold standard to build a world system that, by 1900, had become extremely comfortable for the United States. Hannigan argues that President Woodrow Wilson’s policymaking was more conservative than is widely believed and that both Wilson and his successors sought to preserve and develop the existing world order rather than build a new one. Looking at Wilson’s policies in Asia, Europe, and Latin America, Hannigan contends that a quest for stability rather than a drive for revolutionary change lay at the heart of Wilson’s agenda and that this approach continued to shape U.S. strategy under the Harding and Coolidge administrations that followed. Readers will come away from this thoughtful book with a richer understanding of problems that continue to challenge the United States today."

Mann has written an uneven but ultimately rewarding account of the rise of the rival Roosevelt clans of New York. The Republican Roosevelts of Oyster Bay and the Democratic Roosevelts of Hyde Park were not closely related by blood: Franklin Roosevelt and Theodore Roosevelt were fifth cousins. Eleanor Roosevelt was, in Mann’s telling, the central figure of the family drama. She was Franklin’s wife and Theodore’s niece; her relationships with both men were difficult, and bad feeling between her and Theodore’s children turned the Roosevelt wars into a gripping national saga. When Theodore Roosevelt, Jr., tried to follow in his father’s footsteps by running for governor of New York in 1924, Eleanor organized and funded a group to drive around the state in a car made to resemble a teapot in an attempt (which she later admitted was unjust) to link him to the Teapot Dome scandal. Mann is better at chronicling the Roosevelts’ love lives and sibling rivalries than at placing this remarkable family in the context of U.S. history, and although Mann’s portrait of Theodore contains recognizable elements, the author’s visceral dislike of the man renders him a one-dimensional villain. Even so, The Wars of the Roosevelts is what Theodore might have called “a ripping read” and deserves a wide audience."

Schoolchildren were given prizes for memorizing and reciting it, celebrations of Washington’s birthday featured public readings of it, and patriotic orators referred to it endlessly. All of that is lost today. Avlon’s timely book makes a strong case for bringing Washington’s final public message back into the national consciousness as a way of strengthening the frayed political fabric of the aging republic. With input from both James Madison and Alexander Hamilton, Washington’s Farewell Address called for amity between native-born and immigrant citizens, counseled constant vigilance against the dangers of foreign meddling in the U.S. political process, and warned against the corrosive effects of habitual partisan rancor on the institutions that make democracy work. Avlon hopes that a rediscovery of such wisdom might strengthen the union to which Washington dedicated his life; many readers of this powerful and well-argued book will hope the author is right."

The United States is a great power, he argues in this short but ambitious book, not just because Americans have a successful constitution but also because the United States occupies some of the richest temperate land in the world. The country comprises an immense mass of fertile land watered by the greatest network of navigable rivers in the world—rivers whose flows unite the vast expanse between the Rockies and the Appalachians into an economic (and therefore political) unit. But the size and variety of the country have often made it difficult for Americans to unify around communal visions of national identity and the proper U.S. role in the world. Kaplan notes that the taming and development of the arid American West required new forms of political organization and a more powerful role for government. That experience, he suggests, might provide the inspiration for innovative social policies that could promote social cohesion in the years to come."

Opal takes a bleak view of Jackson and of the populism that propelled him to the presidency. In Opal’s view, on economic matters, Jackson was anything but a populist: in fact, he was a consistent opponent of the relief bills that desperate debtors on the western frontier introduced in state legislatures to protect their assets during the frequent financial panics that marked the early decades of the nineteenth century. To Opal, what qualifies Jackson as a populist was the ferocity with which he pursued the destruction and dispossession of the remaining Native American nations. The greed of speculators, the land hunger of poor farmers, and the legacy of hatred that generations of bitter fighting had created among white settlers were the forces that propelled Jackson to the White House. Many readers will see Trump’s revival of a Jacksonian spirit as embodying and encouraging similar forces. The question, both in Jackson’s time and today, is whether populism can also offer something better."
38,Religion on the Battlefield,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2017-04-14/religion-battlefield,Religion on the Battlefield,"This short but thoughtful book invites readers to reconsider their ideas about the role of religion in war. Ever since the 9/11 attacks, the intersection of religion and organized violence has been understood in ideological terms, with a focus on extremism; unsurprisingly, Islam has attracted most attention of this kind. Hassner wants readers to instead think of religion as a set of practices that appear in a variety of forms but have something to do with the sacred—and serve as sources of motivation and inhibition and also exploitation and provocation. He concentrates on major wars with a particular, but not exclusive, emphasis on Christianity and Western attitudes. He divides the discussion into four areas where the practice of religion interacts with the practice of war: sacred time (respect for the Sabbath during the American Civil War, Egypt and Syria choosing the holy day of Yom Kippur to attack Israel in 1973); sacred places (the special meaning of Jerusalem as a prize to capture, efforts to attack Rome in 1944 without hitting the Vatican); sacred leaders (the role of chaplains); and sacred rituals (prayer before battle). He notes that in any conflict, religious practices can act as force multipliers."

Moseley, himself a former war correspondent, tackles that question in a largely descriptive survey, reliant on memoirs, that still manages to cover all of the war’s theaters and relate the experiences of reporters from all the Allied countries. The book is full of striking vignettes: a reporter yelling “Traitors!” at his carrier pigeons as the birds fly toward German lines in France rather than back to London, as they were supposed to; the American journalist Martha Gellhorn observing that many of the people she had met in Germany denied being Nazis and claimed to have helped Jews. Toward the end of the book, Moseley considers whether journalists might have held back some information out of a desire to not undermine the war effort by demoralizing the public."

It ingeniously links key concepts from economics not just to government policies and the workings of big corporations but also to everyday family life and the day-to-day functioning of small companies. Reading this book is a pleasurable and easy way to become familiar with important economic ideas such as comparative advantage, unemployment, aggregate demand, inflation, and income inequality."

Their most corrosive effect, in his judgment, is not to allow individuals (including criminals) and corporations to avoid or evade taxes, although that is important. Rather, the worst thing about tax havens is the way in which they prevent the kind of transparency in transactions that any well-functioning market requires. Tax havens also erode trust in democratic governments, which have proved unable or unwilling to enforce their own laws and regulations. Murphy and his colleagues at the nonprofit Tax Justice Network have helpfully ranked 92 jurisdictions according to what each one provides in terms of financial secrecy—which should not be confused with legally protected financial privacy, which does not harm other members of society. Vanuatu and Samoa are the most secretive places, but the most important tax havens are Switzerland and Hong Kong. The United States does not fare particularly well in this ranking; laws pertaining to corporations and trusts are mainly enforced at the state level, and a number of states use relatively lax rules to attract firms and capital. If secrecy jurisdictions were curtailed, the world would be a much better place, Murphy contends: democracies would be stronger, and markets more efficient."
42,The Curse of Cash,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2017-04-14/curse-cash,The Curse of Cash,"This persuasive book makes the novel argument that highly developed countries should eventually eliminate paper money altogether, at least for large transactions, and that they should eliminate high-denomination notes—for example, the $100 bill and the 500 euro bill—as soon as practically possible. Such notes are rarely used in ordinary transactions and often support criminal activities and tax evasion. The book also addresses some of the cash-related problems that today’s low-interest environment poses to monetary policy. Paper currency—which, in effect, is the equivalent of interest-free government debt—limits the extent to which interest rates can become negative, which might be desirable under some conditions, including those that have prevailed in recent years. Although phasing out paper currency would introduce some inconveniences, Rogoff argues that the benefits would far outweigh the costs. It’s an important and thought-provoking proposal."

This year’s edition makes for a sobering read. It foresees slower global economic growth and increasing public disappointment with the ability of governments to ensure prosperity or even provide basic public goods such as education, health care, and security. The threat from terrorist organizations will increase, further undermining public confidence. Over the longer period, outcomes will depend to a high degree on demographic changes, the effects of which the report declines to specifically forecast, offering instead a number of imaginative potential scenarios—some negative, some positive."
44,Realpolitik: A History,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2017-04-14/realpolitik-history,Realpolitik: A History,"The term “realpolitik” is widely used today as a synonym for “power politics” and understood as the realist approach to foreign policy, a venerable tradition that stretches from Machiavelli and Bismarck to scholar-diplomats of the postwar era such as George Kennan and Henry Kissinger. In this fascinating biography of the concept, Bew reveals its rather surprising intellectual provenance and explains its shifting role in grand debates over statecraft. Bew traces the term to the mid-nineteenth-century writings of a little-known German thinker, August Ludwig von Rochau. For Rochau, “realpolitik” referred less to a philosophy than to a method for working through the contradictions emerging across Europe as the competing forces of liberalism and nationalism gave shape to modern states. A few decades later, the term entered the Anglo-American world, where it became entangled with concepts such as machtpolitik (the politics of force) and weltpolitik (global power politics). In the early twentieth century, the liberal internationalist movement galvanized by U.S. President Woodrow Wilson explicitly cast its ideas in contrast to such concepts. But by recovering the origins of “realpolitik,” Bew suggests that its original meaning might prove useful for today’s internationalists, who, like Rochau before them, are struggling to reconcile liberal ideals with a rising tide of nationalism."

One result is the emergence of hybrid regimes led by strongman rulers who win office through elections but, once in power, augment their executive authority at the expense of free speech and fair play. Peer’s illuminating little book provides a ground-level account of this phenomenon in India and Turkey, revealing striking parallels between the two cases. In both places, the turn to authoritarianism has proceeded slowly, as Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan have introduced business-friendly policies while chipping away at the freedom of the press and civil rights. Both men have moved away from Western-style political visions of democratic rights and liberties in favor of appeals to nationalism and ethnic and religious identity. With a keen journalist’s eye, Peer observes how various kinds of people—politicians, shopkeepers, intellectuals—experience these regime transitions. He finds that the most profound change is also the most subtle: a slow and sometimes imperceptible erosion of civic culture and political norms that undermines the democratic spirit."
46,Age of Anger: A History of the Present,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2017-04-14/age-anger-history-present,Age of Anger: A History of the Present,"What explains today’s global disorder, when liberalism is under assault by violent extremism, populist nationalism, xenophobia, religious tribalism, and antiglobalization? In this ambitious portrait of the current moment, Mishra sees all these problems as rooted in liberalism itself. Beginning in the 1990s, a liberal democratic revolution enveloped the world, spreading an ideology of free markets, individualism, secularism, and consumerism. Paradoxically, Mishra argues, that revolution both succeeded and failed: it overturned old social hierarchies and cultures of solidarity but left moral and spiritual vacuums in its wake. Liberal modernity has stripped people all over the world of their sense of community, identity, and meaning. Mishra also usefully reminds readers that Western narratives of modernity tend to minimize the resentment, rage, and mass violence that accompanied the spread of democracy and capitalism. Still, modern Western societies are hardly the only historical sources of alienation, despair, war, and genocide, and such horrors long predate the rise of liberalism. In the end, Mishra is better at capturing today’s Zeitgeist than at pinning down the precise relationship between any earlier “age of anger” and the current one."

In this brilliant, imaginative book, Slaughter upends this conception and offers a different image: a global web of networks where games are played not through bargaining but by building connections and relationships. The book dives deeply into “network science” and the dynamics of nonhierarchical systems. Energy, trade, disease, crime, terrorism, human rights: in Slaughter’s view, these are all areas of threat and opportunity that are now driven more by networks than by traditional interstate relations. Slaughter calls on policymakers to develop a “network mindset” that replaces the chessboard’s emphasis on states, sovereignty, coercion, and self-interest with the web’s orientation toward connections, relationships, sharing, and engagement. She argues not that power politics is disappearing but that it increasingly coexists with a more decentralized and shifting system of networks. This book represents an important watershed in thinking about power and interdependence in the contemporary world."

He threatened to launch a trade war against China, calling for a 45 percent tariff on Chinese imports to the United States and promising to label Beijing a currency manipulator. After his election as U.S. president, he broke with four decades of precedent when he spoke to Taiwan’s leader on the phone and declared that the United States might not uphold the “one China” policy—the foundation of U.S.-Chinese ties—under which the United States does not formally recognize the Taiwanese government. On his first full weekday in office, Trump withdrew the United States from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), the 12-nation, U.S.-led trade deal that many in the American foreign policy establishment saw as crucial to preserving U.S. influence in the region."

Through a series of ingenious experiments, Kahneman and Tversky discovered systematic biases in the way humans estimate probabilities and, in so doing, revolutionized the study and practice of economics, medicine, law, and public policy.

The street was full of dust, and Iraqis of all ages were streaming in and out, some of them clutching folders. A group of men was standing near the door in authoritative poses, and older women were yelling at them, pleading for information. I was new to the country, and a little baffled at first that these scraps of yellowing paper had provoked so much passion and excitement. It did not take me long to figure out why. For all the Iraqis publicly executed under Saddam, countless more had disappeared into his archipelago of dungeons. Their families had submitted to a familiar pattern: years of soul-sapping hope and dread, with regime officials cynically demanding money in exchange for information about the disappeared that they never supplied. Some of these people told me they would have given almost anything for the peace of mind conveyed by a genuine death certificate."

What Abraham Lincoln called “the unfinished work” of ensuring “government of the people, by the people, for the people” has suffered its share of setbacks.

Last February, during the Republican primary campaign, he pledged that if elected, he would authorize techniques “a hell of a lot worse than waterboarding.” Doing so, he later bragged, “wouldn’t bother me even a little bit.” Trump insisted that “torture works”—and that even if it doesn’t, terrorists “deserve it anyway.”"

That should be cause for celebration. But this recovery has been an underwhelming one. Throughout this period, the global economy has grown at an average annual pace of just 2.5 percent—a record low when compared with economic rebounds that took place in the decades after World War II. Rather than rejoicing, then, many experts are now anxiously searching for a way to push the world economy out of its low-growth trap. Some economists and investors have placed their hopes on populists such as U.S. President Donald Trump, figuring that if they can make their countries’ economies grow quickly again, the rest of the world might follow along."

President Getúlio Vargas, a stocky, gravelly voiced gaucho from Brazil’s deep south, had granted new rights, including paid vacation, to a generation of workers in the 1930s and 1940s. But after Vargas returned to power in 1951, one of his top aides was charged with murder, and Vargas himself faced allegations that the state-run Bank of Brazil had granted sweetheart loans to a pro-government journalist. “I feel I am standing in a sea of mud,” Vargas lamented. After a late-night cabinet meeting on August 24, 1954, failed to solve the crisis, and with numerous generals demanding his resignation, Vargas withdrew to his bedroom, grabbed a Colt pistol, and shot himself through the heart."
55,Iran’s Next Supreme Leader,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/iran/2017-04-09/iran-s-next-supreme-leader,Iran’s Next Supreme Leader,"On July 17, 2016, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran’s supreme leader, turned 77. Rumors that he suffers from cancer have circulated for over a decade, and in 2014, the state-run news agency published photos of him recovering from prostate surgery. Although Khamenei’s prognosis remains closely guarded, the Iranian government is evidently treating his succession with urgency. In December 2015, Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, a former president and a kingmaker, broached the usually taboo subject when he publicly admitted that a council within the Assembly of Experts, the body that selects the supreme leader, was already vetting potential successors. And last March, after new members of the assembly were elected to an eight-year term, Khamenei himself called the probability that they would have to select his replacement “not low.”"
56,Getting Tough on North Korea,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/north-korea/getting-tough-north-korea,Getting Tough on North Korea,"For the past quarter century, the United States and South Korea have tried to convince North Korea to abandon its nuclear aspirations. Beginning in the early 1990s, Washington attempted to bargain with Pyongyang, while Seoul pursued a strategy of economic engagement, effectively subsidizing Pyongyang with aid and investment even as it continued to develop nuclear weapons. Then, after North Korea tested an atomic bomb in 2006, the United States pressed the UN Security Council to impose sanctions on North Korea. Yet at the urging of South Korea and for fear of angering China, the United States failed to use its full diplomatic and financial power to enforce those sanctions. All along, the goal has been to induce North Korea to open up to the outside world and roll back its nuclear and missile programs."
57,Intelligence and the Presidency,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2017-04-17/intelligence-and-presidency,Intelligence and the Presidency,"U.S. presidents and other senior policymakers often come into office knowing little about the 17 federal agencies and offices that make up the U.S. intelligence community, but in short order, they come to rely heavily on its unique technologies, tradecraft, and expert analysis. The intelligence community’s mission is to provide national leaders with the best and most timely information available on global affairs and national security issues—information that, in turn, can help those leaders achieve their foreign policy objectives."
58,The False Promise of Protectionism,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2017-04-17/false-promise-protectionism,The False Promise of Protectionism,"In his inaugural address, U.S. President Donald Trump pledged that economic nationalism would be the hallmark of his trade policy. “We must protect our borders from the ravages of other countries making our products, stealing our companies, and destroying our jobs,” he said. Within days, he withdrew the United States from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), announced that he would renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), and threatened to impose a special tax on U.S. companies that move their factories abroad."
59,The Liberal Order Is Rigged,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/world/2017-04-17/liberal-order-rigged,The Liberal Order Is Rigged,"Prior to 2016, debates about the global order mostly revolved around its structure and the question of whether the United States should actively lead it or should retrench, pulling back from its alliances and other commitments. But during the past year or two, it became clear that those debates had missed a key point: today’s crucial foreign policy challenges arise less from problems between countries than from domestic politics within them. That is one lesson of the sudden and surprising return of populism to Western countries, a trend that found its most powerful expression last year in the United Kingdom’s decision to leave the EU, or Brexit, and the election of Donald Trump as U.S. president."
60,The Case for Trump’s Foreign Policy,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/world/2017-04-17/case-trump-s-foreign-policy,The Case for Trump’s Foreign Policy,"Media coverage of U.S. President Donald Trump’s foreign policy has been overwhelmingly negative. Analysts have seized on early policy missteps, a supposed slowness in staffing the national security bureaucracy, and controversial statements and actions as evidence that Trump’s foreign policy is already failing."
61,Is America Still Safe for Democracy?,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2017-04-17/america-still-safe-democracy,Is America Still Safe for Democracy?,"The election of Donald Trump as president of the United States—a man who has praised dictators, encouraged violence among supporters, threatened to jail his rival, and labeled the mainstream media as “the enemy”—has raised fears that the United States may be heading toward authoritarianism. While predictions of a descent into fascism are overblown, the Trump presidency could push the United States into a mild form of what we call “competitive authoritarianism”—a system in which meaningful democratic institutions exist yet the government abuses state power to disadvantage its opponents."
62,The Plot Against American Foreign Policy,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2017-04-17/plot-against-american-foreign-policy,The Plot Against American Foreign Policy,"Is the world witnessing the demise of the U.S.-led liberal order? If so, this is not how it was supposed to happen. The great threats were supposed to come from hostile revisionist powers seeking to overturn the postwar order. The United States and Europe were supposed to stand shoulder to shoulder to protect the gains reaped from 70 years of cooperation. Instead, the world’s most powerful state has begun to sabotage the order it created. A hostile revisionist power has indeed arrived on the scene, but it sits in the Oval Office, the beating heart of the free world. Across ancient and modern eras, orders built by great powers have come and gone—but they have usually ended in murder, not suicide."
63,How to Maintain America’s Edge,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2017-03-23/how-maintain-america-s-edge,How to Maintain America’s Edge,"In February 2016, scientists from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and the California Institute of Technology, or Caltech, joined with the National Science Foundation (NSF) to share some remarkable news: two black holes 1.3 billion light-years away had collided, and the resulting gravitational waves had been “heard” by the twin detectors of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO). This was the first time such waves—ripples in the space-time continuum caused by the violent acceleration of massive objects—had ever been directly observed. Albert Einstein had predicted such waves a century ago, but it was long doubted that instrumentation sensitive enough to confirm their existence could ever be created. It took more than four decades of work by a vast team of scientists to make the impossible possible."
64,A Vision of Trump at War,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/united-states/vision-trump-war,A Vision of Trump at War,"Just a few months into the Trump administration, it still isn’t clear what course the president’s foreign policy will ultimately take. What is clear, however, is that the impulsiveness, combativeness, and recklessness that characterized Donald Trump’s election campaign have survived the transition into the presidency. Since taking office, Trump has continued to challenge accepted norms, break with diplomatic traditions, and respond to perceived slights or provocations with insults or threats of his own. The core of his foreign policy message is that the United States will no longer allow itself to be taken advantage of by friends or foes abroad. After decades of “losing” to other countries, he says he is going to put “America first” and start winning again."

She argues that the various ways in which aid is delivered reflect differences in national administrative cultures and, in particular, ideological notions of what role states should play in development. More neoliberal countries, such as the United States, tend to deliver aid via organizations that bypass the central state in the recipient country, particularly when that state has serious governance deficiencies. On the other hand, Dietrich finds that the social democratic states of western Europe are more likely to deliver their aid directly to state bodies. The statistical evidence offered for this arresting hypothesis will not convince all readers, but two compelling chapters reinforce its plausibility through extensive interviews with officials in donor agencies. Unfortunately, Dietrich does not discuss the developmental implications of these differences in aid delivery, so the reader is left wondering how the choices donors make affect development in low-income countries."
1,The Inheritors: An Intimate Portrait of South Africa’s Racial Reckoning,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/inheritors-intimate-portrait-south-africas-racial-reckoning,The Inheritors: An Intimate Portrait of South Africa’s Racial Reckoning,"In this often moving but sometimes rambling narrative, Fairbanks assesses the legacy of apartheid in South Africa through portraits of a handful of individuals and the people around them. She tells these stories ably, and a picture emerges of a South Africa battling various demons inherited from the institutionalized racism that benefited the white minority for a century. Blacks tend to be disappointed by the slow progress the country has made in eliminating social and economic inequalities, whereas whites are adjusting to their sense of their diminished status in a new order, rather oblivious to how they have retained much of their old privileges. Interestingly, Fairbanks argues that many whites feel a sense of guilt—and, in a curious way, a form of anger—over the fact that the Black majority has not exacted greater retribution for the crimes of the past. An underdeveloped theme in the book is the similarity between the United States and South Africa in their wrestling with the legacies of racial injustice."
2,"Sharia, Inshallah: Finding God in Somali Legal Politics",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/sharia-inshallah-finding-god-somali-legal-politics,"Sharia, Inshallah: Finding God in Somali Legal Politics","Responding to those who claim that sharia fuels much of Somalia’s violence and political instability, Massoud argues that Islamic law instead holds the key to rebuilding the political order in the country. He points out that sharia is invoked to justify misogyny and human rights abuses but that it has also been used to advocate for gender equity and democracy. He argues that it is not sharia but struggles over the legal system that have been the main source of contention and conflict going back to the beginning of the colonial era. Two noteworthy chapters discuss this history in which successive national states grappled with how to integrate Western jurisprudence and both customary law and sharia. Massoud views the conflicts that led to the collapse of the central state in 1991 as the logical continuation of these earlier debates about the legal underpinnings of the Somali state. The book is vague on how the principles of sharia can in practice reconstruct an organic and stable legal order, although Massoud appears to view the breakaway state of Somaliland as a potential model of how the right kind of sharia could emerge."
3,Multiethnic Democracy: The Logic of Elections and Policymaking in Kenya,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/multiethnic-democracy-logic-elections-and-policymaking-kenya,Multiethnic Democracy: The Logic of Elections and Policymaking in Kenya,"Conventional wisdom has it that in African countries such as Kenya, where the political salience of ethnicity is very strong, politicians will focus their campaigns on narrow promises of material benefits to their co-ethnic voters. This generalization is misleading on at least two counts, as Horowitz demonstrates in an original study of the role of ethnicity in recent Kenyan elections. Appealing only to one’s co-ethnics will not generate a majority vote in Kenya, as no ethnic group can claim more than a fifth of the population; politicians have to appeal to other groups to win national and many subnational elections. In addition, plenty of evidence suggests that ethnic attachment is not the only motivation for voters, who are often driven more by economic considerations than by the bonds of identity. Using carefully collected data on voters and on the dominant discourse in recent campaigns, Horowitz shows that Kenyan elections are fought over swing voters, who are typically not co-ethnics of any of the major candidates. Kenyan political leaders design their campaigns around broad, inclusive policy goals that will expressly appeal to all groups."
4,To Catch a Dictator: The Pursuit and Trial of Hissène Habré,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/catch-dictator-pursuit-and-trial-hissene-habre,To Catch a Dictator: The Pursuit and Trial of Hissène Habré,"Hissène Habré’s tenure as president of Chad lasted from 1982 to 1990 and was marked by large-scale human rights abuses. But well over a decade after he was deposed in a coup and exiled to Senegal, it seemed likely he would escape responsibility for his record in office. Brody, a longtime lawyer with Human Rights Watch, tells the story of how a broad coalition of human rights activists, lawyers, and victims of Habré’s violence conducted a 25-year campaign to bring the dictator to justice. The book makes for great reading. Brody provides just enough detail of Habré’s grisly rule to sketch the extent of his human rights abuses but moves quickly to an engrossing blow-by-blow account of the international campaign that began in 2000 and would end in a courtroom in Dakar in May 2016, when Habré was found guilty of rape, sexual slavery, and the killing of over 40,000 citizens. He was sentenced to life in prison. Brody provides fascinating insights into the nature of such an international legal coalition, the larger-than-life personalities involved, and their inevitable arguments over tactics."
5,Poverty and Pacification: The Chinese State Abandons the Old Working Class,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/poverty-and-pacification-chinese-state-abandons-old-working-class,Poverty and Pacification: The Chinese State Abandons the Old Working Class,"Although the Chinese Communist Party has received much credit for “lifting millions out of poverty,” Solinger delves into how the party’s economic reforms have also left millions behind. Scholars have fixated on the lot of poor peasants, but she focuses on the urban poor created by the shuttering and privatizing of state-owned enterprise in the late 1990s. Solinger argues that dibao, China’s social assistance program for the urban poor, is shaped by political motivations. It is designed to pacify its recipients rather than to lift them up. Based on outdated benchmarks, the minimum income guarantees condemn the urban poor to being a permanent underclass, offering a sufficient threshold to both keep them silent and prevent them from becoming upwardly mobile. The book obviously benefits from Solinger’s decades of experience studying this issue, evidenced in copious firsthand interview notes and government statistics, but it buries some of its key insights in the latter half. Solinger compares the Chinese case with those of other countries to reveal the irony of China’s avowed “socialism with Chinese characteristics,” which, by neglecting the plight of the proletariat, shows that there is really nothing socialist about the party any longer."
6,We Uyghurs Have No Say: An Imprisoned Writer Speaks,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/we-uyghurs-have-no-say-imprisoned-writer-speaks,We Uyghurs Have No Say: An Imprisoned Writer Speaks,"Tohti is the most famous of the hundreds of Uyghur intellectuals imprisoned by the Chinese state in its effort to destroy Uyghur culture and identity. In 2014, he was a professor at the Chinese government’s special university for the study of ethnic minority issues when he was arrested and given a life sentence on the charge of “separatism.” This selection of his writings shows what this separatism consisted of: bracingly honest analyses of the racism, discrimination, marginalization, and coercive policies that shape Beijing’s treatment of the country’s 55 recognized “national minorities”; nuanced analyses of the social tensions between Uyghurs and Han Chinese; and thoughtful recommendations for how to realize the promises of equal citizenship and minority cultural self-rule laid out in the Chinese constitution and the Regional Ethnic Autonomy Law. Describing himself as a “Chinese patriot,” Tohti warned for years against a rising tide of “totalitarian ethnonationalism,” until that tide swept him away."
7,Ultimate Economic Conflict Between China and Democratic Countries: An Institutional Analysis,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/ultimate-economic-conflict-between-china-and-democratic-countries-institutional-analysis,Ultimate Economic Conflict Between China and Democratic Countries: An Institutional Analysis,"Four prominent legal and trade specialists from Taiwan argue that China should be seen not as a market economy that gets away with transgressing international norms but as a different type of system that prospers under different rules. The authors use case studies of Chinese e-commerce platforms, social media companies, corporate governance structures, antitrust legislation, and inbound and outbound investment practices to show that the Chinese system works through direct and indirect mechanisms of state guidance, subsidization, protection, and data control. These practices apply to both state and nominally private large enterprises. Such a complex and well-functioning system could not be taken apart and reassembled into a Western-style market economy even if Chinese leaders wanted to—and they like their economic model the way it is. The authors suggest that instead of complaining about inequitable trading practices, market economies should create a separate trading community outside the WTO that implements market principles among themselves. But they acknowledge that this will be difficult, given the huge stakes that key Western companies have in China."
8,Coalitions of the Weak: Elite Politics in China from Mao’s Stratagem to the Rise of Xi,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/coalitions-weak-elite-politics-china-maos-stratagem-rise-xi,Coalitions of the Weak: Elite Politics in China from Mao’s Stratagem to the Rise of Xi,"In the last ten years of his life, Mao Zedong purged his senior colleagues and installed in high positions very young officials or those with checkered records. Shih is the first scholar to draw theoretical insight from this curious fact. He suggests that at moments of vulnerability, dictators may surround themselves with “coalitions of the weak” to prevent challenges from powerful rivals. Mao’s successor, Deng Xiaoping, and his fellow elders followed a similar strategy near the end of their lives, putting a weak group of leaders in place. Shih bases his narrative of intricate factional strife on the biographies of Chinese elites, enabling him to assess who was strong and who was weak partly on the basis of how many connections each politician had generated with other ranking actors on his path to high office. Xi Jinping, who came to power with a strong personal network, was able to step into the post-Deng power vacuum and start a new cycle of one-man control, backed by his own coalition of the weak."
9,Two Books on China's Campaign for Influence Abroad,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/two-books-chinas-campaign-influence-abroad,Two Books on China’s Campaign for Influence Abroad,"Two books consider the subtle and covert ways Beijing is seeking to spread its influence abroad. China’s Ministry of State Security (MSS) engages in traditional spycraft, but unlike most countries’ intelligence agencies it also has a large portfolio of campaigns designed to influence opinion in the West and among Chinese overseas communities. With prodigious digging on the Internet, Joske has been able to expose many of the ministry’s senior operatives and their achievements. A vice minister who worked under the pseudonym Yu Enguang charmed Westerners while serving as a journalist in London and Washington, created the China International Culture Exchange Center (whose mission was to “use culture to make friends” abroad), and infiltrated George Soros’s China Fund, which attempted to promote liberal reforms in China in the year and a half before the 1989 Tiananmen crackdown. Zheng Bijian, known for the emollient concept of “China’s peaceful rise” (which he described in an article for this magazine), was not an MSS employee but chaired an MSS-created think tank called the China Reform Forum, which encouraged Western academics and officials to support engagement with China. The ministry’s Tenth Bureau infiltrates overseas student and dissident groups; the Eleventh Bureau runs a foreign policy think tank that engages Western diplomats; the Twelfth Bureau manages front organizations designed to sway unwitting Western targets of influence—many of whom Joske identifies by name."
10,Line of Advantage: Japan’s Grand Strategy in the Era of Abe Shinzo,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/line-advantage-japans-grand-strategy-era-abe-shinzo,Line of Advantage: Japan’s Grand Strategy in the Era of Abe Shinzo,"Green knows Japanese foreign policy like few others. He argues that Shinzo Abe, who served as Japan’s prime minister from 2006 to 2007 and again from 2012 to 2020, reoriented Tokyo’s strategy in a way that will persist, despite his tragic assassination in July 2022. Proactive rather than reactive, he created the concept of a “free and open Indo-Pacific” that became part of American thinking; strengthened military cooperation between the two allies; consolidated the quasi-alliance of Australia, India Japan, and the United States known as the Quad; and resuscitated Washington’s abandoned trans-Pacific trade pact in the form of the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (which the United States has yet to rejoin). These initiatives reflected a “maritime and cosmopolitan” approach that aims to secure Japan’s access to the surrounding oceans on the basis of rule of law and free commercial transit. In Southeast Asia, Abe advanced a “values-oriented diplomacy” and positioned Japan as a trusted partner of countries seeking to hedge against China. At home, he embedded his vision in a strengthened security establishment. Despite its failure to bridge intractable differences with South Korea, Japan today “arguably has the clearest conceptualization, consensus, and implementation of a grand strategy of any of the democracies confronting Chinese hegemonic ambitions in the Indo-Pacific.”"
11,All Necessary Measures? The United Nations and International Intervention in Libya,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/all-necessary-measures-united-nations-and-international-intervention-libya,All Necessary Measures? The United Nations and International Intervention in Libya,"Martin, a UN Special Representative to Libya from 2011 to 2012, has produced a judicious, thoughtful analysis of international involvement in Libya during and immediately after the 2011 uprising against Libyan President Muammar al-Qaddafi in Libya. This book combines the perspective of an insider with the acuity of a seasoned practitioner and analyst. Martin painstakingly weighs the pros and cons of the NATO intervention in 2011, concluding that “a smooth path to a modern democratic state” was not possible. At the same time, he argues that outside powers must bear much of the blame for the country’s collapse into civil war: the United States advocated for and supported the NATO operation but refused to take responsibility for it; European countries worked at cross-purposes; and the UN was hamstrung by coordination challenges. Martin acknowledges but plays down one of the most destructive features of the international involvement: within days of the imposition of an international arms embargo on Libya, at least half a dozen countries began sending arms and military personnel to aid an uprising they did not understand. This support continued long after Tripoli fell and contributed mightily to the country’s plunge into civil war."
12,Reaching for the Heights: The Inside Story of a Secret Attempt to Reach a Syrian-Israeli Peace,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/reaching-heights-inside-story-secret-attempt-reach-syrian-israeli-peace,Reaching for the Heights: The Inside Story of a Secret Attempt to Reach a Syrian-Israeli Peace,"In the early years of the Obama administration, Hof led a U.S. attempt to secure a peace treaty between Israel and Syria. The effort foundered in 2011 when Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s bloody crackdown on peaceful protesters horrified U.S. officials and sank the negotiations. It is not clear, however, that the process, which was shot through with flaws, would have succeeded in any event. U.S. President Barack Obama’s National Security Council seems to have mistaken Israeli-Palestinian negotiations for a comprehensive settlement to the region’s troubles, and neglected the Syrian track. Syria appears to have entertained the discussions largely to improve relations with the United States. And the Israeli government was alternately tempted by and skeptical about the prospects for a separate peace. Hof himself concedes that it was “an American-facilitated beating of Iran and Hezbollah,” Syria’s principal allies, that motivated his “interest in mediating peace.” In the event, no party got what it hoped for. The U.S. administration came away looking indecisive and ineffectual, and Hof was disappointed and chastened. Refreshingly self-critical, Hof faults himself for not understanding the ways of Washington, torn between its self-appointed roles as honest broker and global hegemon."
13,Black Markets and Militants: Informal Networks in the Middle East and Africa,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/black-markets-and-militants-informal-networks-middle-east-and-africa,Black Markets and Militants: Informal Networks in the Middle East and Africa,"In this dense, deeply researched, and edifying volume, Medani takes on the vexed question of how Islamist political movements use informal financial networks in recruiting and sustaining their members. He draws on an unusual and remarkably fruitful comparison of the Islamists of Egypt, Somalia, and Sudan, starting in the 1980s. That decade witnessed the rapid expansion of migrant labor to the Gulf and the parallel growth of remittances sent home by migrant workers. The elaborate informal mechanisms for transferring money were shaped by, and in turn reinforced, networks of clan, tribal, and religious affiliation. New private banks and other financial institutions helped strengthen an Islamist bourgeoisie in Egypt and an Islamist military elite in Sudan. In the 1990s, an economic downturn in the region limited the capacity of states to manage the economy and restrain local militant mobilization. Somalia’s state succumbed altogether; the regime in Egypt cracked down, pushing many moderate Islamists into the waiting arms of more militant groups; and Sudan staggered under the international sanctions imposed on its Islamist government. Medani is particularly acute in describing the complexity of local politics in these countries. The utility of regional identities, clan links, and religious ties varied with fluctuations not only of state policy but also of global business cycles."
14,Degrees of Dignity: Arab Higher Education in the Global Era,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/degrees-dignity-arab-higher-education-global-era,Degrees of Dignity: Arab Higher Education in the Global Era,"A brisk, comprehensive look at universities in the Arab world, this book seeks to assess how well the institutions fulfill their missions. Buckner has lived and worked throughout the region, and she puts to good use her understanding of a variety of educational systems, including in Jordan, Morocco, Qatar, and Syria. Growing populations, shrinking government budgets, and increasing global competition have put a strain on ministries of higher education in the region. Many governments have responded by authorizing the establishment of private, sometimes for-profit institutions to operate beside the public universities that were established soon after many of these countries won independence in the twentieth century. Sometimes, these new private initiatives have absorbed some of the demand for university places, created healthy competition, and encouraged the introduction of novel curricula, particularly if they are affiliated with foreign institutions or offer instruction in foreign languages. But often they have failed in these tasks and poorly serve their faculty and students. Buckner argues that by framing education and research as technical issues—quantified in terms of graduation rates, citation frequencies, and institutional rankings—governments end up crippling universities and suppressing their intrinsically political, often subversive missions of fostering critical thinking, thoughtful research, and creative invention."
15,States of Subsistence: The Politics of Bread in Contemporary Jordan,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/states-subsistence-politics-bread-contemporary-jordan,States of Subsistence: The Politics of Bread in Contemporary Jordan,"The nine million residents of Jordan consume ten million loaves of the local flat khubz arabi a day, nearly all of it made with government-subsidized wheat. Martínez worked as a baker in Amman, accompanied government inspectors on their rounds, talked to customers, and visited bakeries from Aqaba to Ma’an. In this fascinating book, he reveals the extent to which the bread subsidy is intimately woven into the economic, social, and political life of the kingdom. The Jordanian government did not always support this staple: the Ministry of Industry, Trade, and Supply and its subsidy were introduced in the mid-1970s; before that, as one of Martínez’s informants observed, “We used to feed ourselves.” As bread-making moved from the family hearth to the neighborhood bakery, bread became both an essential staple and a symbol of state authority. Decades of economic liberalization, however, have left the Jordanian welfare state in tatters. As Martínez deftly shows, the public debates about bread—a universal demand in the Arab Spring uprisings—illustrate both the state’s profound role in shaping national identity and its fading influence in popular understandings of political authority. As Martinez says, “The bread subsidy was never just about providing food.” It symbolized the monarchy’s patrimonial responsibility for its people, a role lost in neoliberalism’s cash transfers to low-income families."
16,Central Peripheries: Nationhood  in Central Asia,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/central-peripheries-nationhood-central-asia,Central Peripheries: Nationhood  in Central Asia,"Laruelle, a prolific expert on post-­Soviet Central Asia, compiles ten updated essays on nationalist ideologies in the post-Soviet era. The oldest of the essays here—a 2007 paper positing the resurgence of pagan Tengrism, the old Turko-Mongolic religion of the Eurasian steppes, as a rival for Islam—admittedly feels a bit dated; Islam still dominates in all Central Asian republics. Fortunately, the rest of the book offers a stronger introduction to Laruelle’s important work. One highlight is her alarming study of the embrace of “Aryanism” in Tajikistan, where President Emomali Rahmon dubbed 2006 “The Year of Aryan Civilization” and Tajik historians proposed that their “Aryan” ancestors embarked on a civilizing mission against neighboring Turkic nomads. Another is her incisive survey of Soviet ethnography, in which she connects Soviet forms of “race science” to the ethnic chauvinism endorsed by some post-Soviet regimes. The volume’s second half uses case studies from Kazakhstan to show how the country has at once embraced globalization as well as the kind of classical ethno­­nationalism that globalization is often presumed to undermine. Kazakh citizens are encouraged to engage with the world but to speak Kazakh at home, or else risk marginalization. Ethnic minorities, meanwhile, have left the country in droves despite its post-Soviet prosperity."
17,Soviet Nightingales: Care Under Communism,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/soviet-nightingales-care-under-communism,Soviet Nightingales: Care Under Communism,"Grant delves into a fascinating yet understudied topic: the history of nursing in the Soviet Union. The pre-revolutionary Sisters of Mercy were strongly associated with religious virtue but became increasingly secularized and professionalized during World War I. After the Bolshevik revolution in 1917, these nurses were reinvented as Soviet medical workers. Any religious connections were banned, and political instruction became an indispensable element of nursing education. In 1920, the Sisters of Mercy became simply known as “sisters.” Grant emphasizes the incongruity between the brutal reality of the communist regime and its inexorable demand—even during Stalin’s Great Terror—that nurses be kind, caring, and devoted to their patients. The government took very seriously patients’ complaints about neglect or callousness on the part of nurses. Meanwhile, nurses suffered low wages, long shifts, and a chronic shortage of housing and often worked in dismal conditions without running water or functioning sewage systems. Grant admits that some of these problems also troubled nurses in Western countries, but even by the end of its existence, in 1991, the Soviet Union had not improved the lot of these workers."
18,Two Books on Modern Russian Identity,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/two-books-modern-russian-identity,Two Books on Modern Russian Identity,"Two books explore the evolution of Russian national identity in recent decades. Kolsto’s in-depth study looks at the intricacies of nationalism in the post-Soviet space, from perestroika in the late 1980s to the Russian annexation of Crimea and the war in the Donbas in 2014. As the Soviet Union disintegrated, leaders of the newly independent states promptly switched from championing communism to embracing ethnic nationalism. In Russia, however, national identity remained vague, and the term “Russianness” was ambiguous and politically charged. On the one hand, Russia was (and remains) a multiethnic nation comprising two dozen ethnic territories, some of them ethnocracies in their own right. On the other hand, “Russianness” was not confined to Russia’s borders: the government and the people alike tend to claim that their neighbors, Ukrainians and Belarusians, are mere subgroups of a larger Russian nation, and self-identified ethnic Russians live across the post-Soviet space. Kolsto’s thorough analysis portrays Russian identity as an entanglement of the imperial and the ethnic. The annexation of Crimea in 2014 was universally applauded in Russia, including by ethnonationalists who used to criticize Putin for neglecting the interests of ethnic Russians. They subsequently condemned Putin, however, for not going all the way to Kyiv in what they saw as a betrayal of their Russian kin in Ukraine. With his new invasion of Ukraine, Putin has suppressed his ethnonationalist opponents and fully appropriated the broad nationalist cause."
19,Ripe for Revolution: Building Socialism in the Third World,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/ripe-revolution-building-socialism-third-world,Ripe for Revolution: Building Socialism in the Third World,"Many developing countries that had liberated themselves from Western, capitalist rulers in the twentieth century were naturally drawn to socialism. Friedman’s impressive study, which spans several decades and five countries—Angola, Chile, Indonesia, Iran, and Tanzania—is devoted to “the trial and error” of postcolonial socialist projects in these places. China, the Soviet Union, and other communist countries tried to guide these initiatives, but they found that promoting an ideology based on class was almost impossible in societies where social relations were often defined by race. Friedman points out that citizens in newly independent countries frequently saw the Soviets as “whites”—that is, the same as their former imperialist oppressors. And although militant atheism remained the cornerstone of communist ideology, the Soviets had to learn to regard Islam as a positive force in national liberation movements in countries such as Indonesia and Iran. The communist mentors also grappled with the independent ambitions of their protégés, such as Julius Nyerere, the first president of Tanzania, who firmly insisted that his country was building its own kind of socialism and would not become a client of either China or the Soviet Union, despite relying on their economic aid and expert assistance. Although the pursuit of socialism in the global South generally ended in failure, Friedman argues that it left lasting legacies across Africa, Asia, and Latin America."
20,Infinite Country: A Novel,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/infinite-country-novel,Infinite Country: A Novel,"Engel’s unstated premise is that national borders are artificial, illegitimate boundaries and that enduring family love and human compassion should outweigh restrictive, often brutal immigration laws. She wraps her worldview in a poignant if at times overwrought tale, threaded with Andean mythologies, of three generations of urban, working-class Colombians who overcome social barriers and personal flaws to finally reunite in their new homeland, the northeastern United States. Burnishing her progressive credentials, Engel, a dual U.S.-Colombian citizen, insists on leavening her heroes’ achievements with sharp if familiar criticisms of the depreciated American dream. In describing the heartbreak of family separations and betrayals across generations, Engel’s style lies between the lyricism of the prolific Chilean novelist Isabel Allende and the deeper erudition of the younger Mexican writer Valeria Luiselli. Tellingly, Engel fails to consider the route to redemption suggested, albeit through a form of magical realism, in Disney’s blockbuster film Encanto: namely, that internally displaced persons, rather than venture across international borders, can find safer havens within their Colombian homeland, rich in natural beauty, community solidarity, and economic opportunities."
21,"Unsettled Land: From Revolution to Republic, the Struggle for Texas",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/unsettled-land-revolution-republic-struggle-texas,"Unsettled Land: From Revolution to Republic, the Struggle for Texas","Haynes delivers a powerful counternarrative to the traditional foundational myths about the defense of the Alamo and the origins of Texas: the shopworn narrative of a heroic American resistance overcoming Mexican despotism. In so doing, he proposes another myth: a pre-independence, Mexico-ruled multicultural province where English speakers, Hispanics, indigenous tribes, and freed Blacks coexisted in relative harmony. For all these groups, apart from white males, independence for Texas in 1836 and then its incorporation into the United States as a state in 1845 resulted not in liberation but in a devastating loss of liberty. Haynes enriches this revisionism with the histories of embattled indigenous tribes (some native to the region, others recently arrived), all tragic victims of a purposeful, blood-soaked ethnic cleansing perpetrated by whites. Endemic political chaos in Mexico City and an underfunded and poorly led Mexican military allowed Texas, with a population of under 100,000 (only some 30,000 of whom were Anglo-Americans), to win independence from Mexico, with a population of some eight million people. Haynes’s riveting tale of the state’s violent, intolerant, color-coded history reverberates in the radical politics of today’s increasingly radical Texas Republican Party."
22,Two Books on the Problems Plaguing Central America and the Caribbean,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/two-books-problems-plaguing-central-america-and-caribbean,Two Books on the Problems Plaguing Central America and the Caribbean,"Two books seek ways to ward off chaos in Central America and the Caribbean. Shenai, a former U.S. Treasury Department official responsible for Central America, has written a thoughtful study of the vexing problems plaguing the countries of the Northern Triangle: El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. Loyal to his Treasury training, Shenai makes the case for structural economic reforms such as improving tax collection, reducing barriers to legitimate commerce, and expanding the access of citizens to financial instruments. If combined with enhanced public-sector accountability and financial integrity, these economic reforms could lead to virtuous cycles of more rapid economic growth, renewed trust in government institutions, and stronger, more efficacious development. Recognizing that reform-minded forces in Central America confront entrenched vested interests, Shenai calls on the United States—along with Canada, Mexico, and international financial institutions—to actively engage when domestic constituencies eager for reform gain sway. Shenai’s hopeful policy recommendations are broadly in line with those of the Biden administration’s “root causes” strategy for reducing immigration from the Northern Triangle. Fixing Central America is a complex generational project, and Shenai urges patience even as he recognizes that many politicians, in the region and in Washington, inevitably search for quick fixes."
23,Globalizing Patient Capital: The Political Economy of Chinese Finance in the Americas,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/globalizing-patient-capital-political-economy-chinese-finance-americas,Globalizing Patient Capital: The Political Economy of Chinese Finance in the Americas,"Drawing on his academic expertise and his practical experience as a researcher at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Kaplan presents an in-depth, carefully reasoned assessment of the sudden burst in Chinese lending to Latin American governments. Some critics allege that China surreptitiously seeks to lure vulnerable countries into debt traps, but Kaplan emphasizes how Chinese state banks are working to export what they perceive as their successful state-led development model while creating fresh business opportunities for large state-owned enterprises. In contrast to capitalist banking, Chinese lenders offer long-term loans that better fit the development needs of Latin America; less concerned with the near-term debt repayment capabilities of loan recipients, patient Chinese lenders don’t seek to impose intrusive macroeconomic conditions on countries. But Chinese banks do seek assurances by demanding collateral in commodity exports and by tying credits to purchases of Chinese industrial products and sometimes even by requiring a Chinese workforce for local projects. Kaplan advises Latin American governments to push back against Chinese procurement demands, to insist on greater transparency in project contracts, and to mitigate future debt burdens through alternative forms of financing, including direct foreign investment."
24,A Small State’s Guide to Influence in World Politics,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/small-states-guide-influence-world-politics,A Small State’s Guide to Influence in World Politics,"Building on his seminal 2015 work, Latin America Confronts the United States, Long persuasively presses his case that smaller states, with creative leadership, can often successfully defend their national interests in contests with bigger ones. He urges his scholarly colleagues to redefine international relations studies by stretching beyond the interactions of great powers to focus on the many smaller states that light up the geopolitical firmament. Deploying some 20 illustrative country studies, Long outlines the key variables that smaller states must consider in designing winning bargaining strategies: which policy issues matter in dueling countries, the extent of policy divergence between them, and the cohesion among elites in great powers. Smaller polities can be ambitious but must admit the very real constraints imposed by asymmetries of power and by global norms and institutions. Long’s success stories in Latin America include Panama gaining control over its canal at the end of the twentieth century and, more recently, El Salvador negotiating with the United States over military facilities and Bolivia bargaining with neighboring Brazil over natural gas."
25,"The New Atlantic Order: The Transformation of International Politics, 1860-1933",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/new-atlantic-order-transformation-international-politics-1860-1933,"The New Atlantic Order: The Transformation of International Politics, 1860-1933","This magisterial work focuses on the failure to prevent World War II. Realists and liberal defenders of the League of Nations have long contended that after World War I, France, the United Kingdom, and, above all, the United States should have formed a military alliance to contain Germany. Cohrs advances a less well-known argument. In his view, any European order based solely on military containment was doomed unless it addressed the deeper sources of all European conflicts from 1850 to the present: diverging claims of national self-determination, opposing economic and financial interests, and intense ideological strife between the political right, left, and center. Not enough was done at Versailles—and, the author sometimes seems to suggest, not enough could possibly have been done—to resolve these matters in ways that would have lent the settlement a critical measure of domestic and international legitimacy. This failure encouraged nondemocratic revisionist powers (notably, but not only, Hitler’s Germany) to make intractable demands, such as to revise the Treaty of Versailles and to restore lost territory, with fatal consequences for the postwar peace. Although this account owes much to classic works by the economist John Maynard Keynes and the sociologist Max Weber, among others, its sweeping synthesis and grounding in primary sources makes an impressive thousand-page read."
26,Foreign States in Domestic Markets: Sovereign Wealth Funds and the West,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/foreign-states-domestic-markets-sovereign-wealth-funds-and-west,Foreign States in Domestic Markets: Sovereign Wealth Funds and the West,"Rising economic interdependence within a neoliberal global economy is often believed to be undermining the power of sovereign states. These authors respond that, in fact, states are in many respects more active than ever. Over the past 20 years, for example, massive state-run sovereign wealth funds based in Asia and the Middle East have, often acting at the direction of their governments, purchased or invested in many leading financial, retail, sports, media, industry, and technology companies in the United States and Europe. One might have expected a hostile reaction to efforts by figures from nondemocratic countries such as China, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, and the United Arab Emirates to buy into Western economies. Yet most in the West have welcomed such state investment. The only major country to enact laws discriminating against these foreign entities, thereby limiting their presence, is the United States. Despite their patina of political science jargon, the four case studies in this book offer basic data and succinct analysis of recent policies on this issue—which is sure to loom large as Western democracies ponder how to respond to the rising geoeconomic power of their global competitors."
27,"Do Elections (Still) Matter?: Mandates, Institutions, and Policy in Western Europe",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/do-elections-still-matter-mandates-institutions-and-policy-western-europe,"Do Elections (Still) Matter?: Mandates, Institutions, and Policy in Western Europe","Many citizens of European countries, notably those on the far right and left, believe that elections are meaningless. Politicians make promises, but no matter who wins, shadowy elites and self-serving politicians collude or produce gridlock. This rigorous and data-rich study of five European countries draws a less cynical conclusion. Although the leaders of victorious political parties cannot simply impose their preferred policies, their electoral promises do shape political priorities during their time in government. In multiparty proportional representation systems, such as those in Denmark, France, Germany, and Italy that accord some political representation on the basis of votes cast (and not simply seats won), important issues command focused attention from small groups of voters, who demand action. Ironically, opposition parties often play a critical role in this process of translating election promises into action, because they gain advantage by mobilizing those small groups to punish the government for its failure to deliver on its promises. The United Kingdom, however, emerges as an exception: British parties do not keep their promises. The first-past-the-post electoral system suppresses the distinct ideological identities of the major parties as politicians must try to win a broad electorate; they can afford to ignore the niche inclinations of small groups, whose particular interests have little hope of finding political representation. In such a system, opposition parties cannot score points by appealing to small groups and are therefore less able to hold their rivals to account. This dynamic helps explain not just the widespread perception of some recent British governments as arbitrary and unpredictable but perhaps also the increasingly disillusioned attitude of voters in the world’s other prominent majoritarian political system: the United States."
28,Salazar: The Dictator Who Refused to Die,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/salazar-dictator-who-refused-die,Salazar: The Dictator Who Refused to Die,"In this book, a British academic expert on Portugal seeks to salvage the reputation of António Salazar, the autocrat who ruled the country from 1932 to 1968. Few would quibble with the first half of the author’s argument: rather than being a totalitarian, Salazar was a conservative. His rule was milder than that of contemporaries such as Hitler, Mussolini, Stalin, and Franco. He engaged in only modest domestic repression, sought no territorial expansion, remained neutral in World War II, and took the side of the West in the Cold War. He wore no uniform, proposed no radical ideology, eschewed cults of personality, avoided mobilizing the masses, and lived a restrained and apparently incorrupt personal life. Some may balk, however, at the second half of the argument, namely that Salazar was a “benevolent autocrat,” an interpretation that overlooks his suppression of multiparty democracy, his support for the Catholic Church’s socially reactionary values, and his disinterest in economic development as long as the government budget remained in balance. The book also dismisses as insignificant Salazar’s stubborn (and overtly racist) decision to defend the remains of Portugal’s empire. Yet today Portugal is a stable democracy where a recent poll found that its citizens consider Salazar the greatest leader the country has ever had. Gallagher invites readers to wonder whether, in the end, Portugal’s slow and cautious road to democracy might have been for the best."
29,Chums: How a Tiny Caste of Oxford Tories Took Over the UK,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/chums-how-tiny-caste-oxford-tories-took-over-uk,Chums: How a Tiny Caste of Oxford Tories Took Over the UK,"Most foreigners are perplexed by the flagrant air of diffidence and dilettantism with which former British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and other contemporary Brexiteers have ruled the United Kingdom. According to this engaging and detailed book, their conduct reflects their upbringing. Since 1955, five Conservative prime ministers (and a surprising number of their close associates) have attended Eton College and then Oxford University. At Eton, most of them studied ancient languages, read nostalgic tales of the British Empire, honed their ability to speak in public, and triumphed over their peers in cutthroat schoolboy politics. Also, whether born to it or not, they learned how to wear white tie, speak with a proper accent, and break rules with a witty insouciance that signaled unquestioned upper-class privilege. Once at Oxford, they eschewed the study of the natural and social sciences in favor of English, constitutional history, and classics—subjects whose obvious lack of practical utility further cemented their social distinction and whose ease allowed them to fake their way through tutorials without sharpening analytical skills or spending hours reading. Instead, they frequented the Oxford Union, a venerable institution of which Johnson was president. At its parliamentary-style debates, they perfected the arts of manipulating arcane procedures, stabbing fellow students in the back, and, above all, making others laugh, which allowed them to triumph over those who came armed with facts, analysis, and a sense of public purpose. Three decades later, the result is an experienced cohort of superficially eccentric yet in fact resolutely reactionary leaders whose ability to appeal to both wealthy interests and popular prejudices has been honed to a fine edge. Theirs may be the last generation of such Oxford Tories, yet their policies may well influence the United Kingdom for generations."
30,Two Books on U.S. Politics and the Republican Party,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/two-books-us-politics-and-republican-party,Two Books on U.S. Politics and the Republican Party,"These two books cover much of the same history but merit individual attention. Both identify the 1990s as the key decade that spawned the Republican Party that exists today. Milbank compresses every awful political occurrence of the past quarter century into a page-turner that is both difficult to stomach and hard to put down. He traces Donald Trump’s prehistory to the Republican revolution of 1994 which made Newt Gingrich became Speaker of the House and indelibly changed the language—and soon the content—of politics. Gingrich identified one of the Republican Party’s “great problems” as insufficient nastiness and produced a memo that laid out the words Republican candidates should use to describe their Democratic opponents: “sick, corrupt, cheat, betray, lie, steal, greed, destroy, pathetic, bizarre, anti-family,” and so on. Political compromise with such a group was obviously out of the question: unyielding obstructionism was the course to follow."

In this elegant volume, equally valuable to specialists and lay readers, two lifelong scholars of First Amendment jurisprudence gather an array of experts to explore the problems presented by digital technology and their possible solutions. The authors conclude that First Amendment law can adapt to this new technology as it has to new media in the past.

The “opportunity” in Wyne’s somewhat misleading title is the opportunity not to accept that paradigm. Great-power competition, he points out, is a phenomenon, not a framework: a description rather than a useful blueprint for policy. It dictates a posture that is inherently reactive, which would “cede the strategic initiative” to China and Russia and lure the United States into geopolitical detours tangential to its true national interests. Instead, the United States should build an “affirmative vision” based on its various competitive advantages (including its geography, ability to attract immigrants, strong currency, and numerous allies) that recognizes how much the world has changed in recent decades through globalization and the emergence of transnational threats that demand urgent collaboration. Wyne does not attempt to describe in any detail what such a policy might look like. But he makes a timely and compelling case that the United States should resist the temptation of simply reacting to the agendas and actions of other powers and instead pursue the more demanding but rewarding route of setting an independent course."
33,Laboratories Against Democracy:  How National Parties Transformed State Politics,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/laboratories-against-democracy-how-national-parties-transformed-state-politics,Laboratories Against Democracy:  How National Parties Transformed State Politics,"In 1932, Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis labeled the 50 U.S. states “laboratories of democracy,” where new policies could be incubated, tested, and spread to other states. Grumbach uses masses of mostly quantitative data to take a new look at this widely held belief and concludes that, if anything, the opposite is now true: state governments have become, in the author’s phrasing, “laboratories against democracy.” In today’s deeply partisan environment, state governments are often dominated by one of the two national parties. In theory, lawmakers at the state level should be closer to their constituents and therefore more responsive to their needs. In practice, this doesn’t hold. Voters pay even less attention to state elections than they do to ones at the federal level, allowing the choice of poorly prepared and extreme candidates and policy outcomes that are increasingly divorced from public opinion. (Bans on abortions passed by many states this summer are an obvious case in point.) Worse still, because states exert constitutional authority over election rules, many Republican-controlled states bent on suppressing Democratic voter turnout have become a threat to American democracy writ large. Grumbach concludes that in the interest of democracy and justice, the roles of state and local government should be reduced over the long term."

The world is still living with the consequences of this complacency and the violent conflicts it triggered. In this compelling account, Spector combines meticulous research with lively writing to describe these extraordinary bloody conflicts, as the Dutch struggled to hold on to Indonesia, the French to Indochina, and the British, more successfully, to Malaya. The United States became involved in Asia to check the growth of communism (especially in the wake of Mao Zedong’s victory over the nationalists in China in 1949), culminating in the decision to defend South Korea from the North’s invasion in the summer of 1950. Washington viewed matters through a Cold War lens, neglecting the strong anticolonial currents rippling through the upheavals of the time. By 1955, the end of Spector’s period of investigation, most of the old colonies had won their independence, and the Korean War was over with the seemingly indelible partition of the peninsula."
35,A Question of Standing: The History of the CIA,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/question-standing-history-cia,A Question of Standing: The History of the CIA,"Jeffreys-Jones, who has been studying the trials and tribulations of the CIA for many years, provides a concise, informed, and thoughtful history of the agency. Intelligence agencies will never fully satisfy their political masters because some important events simply cannot be anticipated. The CIA has had the additional problem of being responsible for covert operations. The exposure of such operations and consequential embarrassment (perhaps most famously in the Bay of Pigs debacle in 1961) has given the CIA an unwelcome reputation for torture, assassinations, and coups. It can be tempting to treat the agency’s history as a succession of scandals, awkward revelations, and official investigations—a “legacy of ashes,” as the journalist Tim Weiner has dubbed it. Jeffreys-Jones’s approach is more balanced, addressing such issues as “excessive Ivy League influence” and lack of diversity in the agency. He notes that much of the CIA’s influence depends on its relationship with the sitting administration. For the system to work best, the CIA’s director must have access to the president and be given the autonomy to present uncomfortable assessments while resisting politically convenient claims—a task the agency has often failed to accomplish, perhaps most significantly in the run-up to the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq."
36,The Great War and the  Birth of Modern Medicine,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/great-war-and-birth-modern-medicine,The Great War and the  Birth of Modern Medicine,"It is one of the paradoxes of war that the enormous effort put into harming people often gives rise to medical breakthroughs and great strides in the treatment of the wounded. This valuable and thoroughly interesting study, informed by the author’s own experience of military surgery, contributes to the histories of both World War I and modern medicine. Helling shows how the horrors of war spurred medical research, including about how to address the effects of gas, reconstruct disfigured faces, use simple splints so that shattered limbs mended in ways that avoided later deformities, understand the psychology of “shell shock,” and deal with the influenza epidemic that began in 1918. It was not just new techniques that made the difference but also new infrastructure, as surgical facilities were moved closer to the frontlines so that soldiers could be treated as quickly as possible."
37,Fugitives: A History of Nazi Mercenaries During the Cold War,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/fugitives-history-nazi-mercenaries-during-cold-war,Fugitives: A History of Nazi Mercenaries During the Cold War,"Orbach has written a detailed, sobering, and absorbing account of the many ways in which ex-Nazis managed to lead comfortable and active lives after World War II. He begins with General Reinhard Gehlen, a former Wehrmacht analyst, who used his trove of material on Soviet forces to start a new career running an intelligence organization, first for the Americans and then later for West Germany. Gehlen drew on the Third Reich’s vehement anticommunism while shedding the rest of his Nazi baggage. Other former Nazis moved closer to Moscow, including as KGB agents who used Gehlen’s organization to insert themselves into West German intelligence. Many never abandoned their anti-Semitism. One of the architects of the Holocaust, Alois Brunner, ended up in Damascus, where he advised the regime of Hafez al-Assad on torture techniques and sought to avoid the fate of his former boss Adolf Eichmann, who was kidnapped by the Israelis in 1960 while hiding in Argentina. Orbach includes some jaw-dropping stories of double dealing, espionage, and outright criminality. The book inevitably raises questions about those in the West who were happy to make use of these ex-Nazis without worrying about their checkered pasts."
38,Fixing the Climate: Strategies for an Uncertain World,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/fixing-climate-strategies-uncertain-world,Fixing the Climate: Strategies for an Uncertain World,"The climate crisis poses a problem of global collective action that governments have sought to address through high-level international negotiations. The resulting arrangements, such as the 2015 Paris agreement, mandate compulsory reductions in emissions and require comprehensive plans for meeting those targets. The authors argue that these treaties are failing because they provide inadequate opportunity for initiative and experimentation at the subnational level. Since the route to successful emissions reduction is fundamentally uncertain, experimentation with different technologies and approaches is essential. Given that the best course is unknowable at the outset, successful strategies are likely to be developed locally and contextualized to local needs. Instead of insisting that all countries must endorse the details of a global agreement, like-minded governments and firms should forge ahead with their own solutions. Sharing the results of their efforts­—what works, what doesn’t—will then limit the costs and risks of adaptation to climate change, while trade taxes and reputational penalties can bring reluctant governments and firms on board. The authors point to the 1987 Montreal Protocol, which protects the ozone layer, as a successful example of this kind of experimental governance. Californians similarly might point to their state’s stringent fuel economy standards and to its plan for banning the internal combustion engine."
39,Streets of Gold: America’s Untold  Story of Immigrant Success,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/streets-gold-americas-untold-story-immigrant-success,Streets of Gold: America’s Untold  Story of Immigrant Success,"In this scholarly yet engaging book, the authors synthesize more than a decade of their historical research on U.S. immigration, dispelling myths and discerning patterns. They combine personal stories drawn from memoirs, secondary accounts, and other sources with careful data analysis. Abramitzky and Boustan helped pioneer the use of machine learning to link records and trace individuals across decennial population censuses and to harvest data from genealogical websites such as Ancestry.com. Putting these sources and methods to work, they establish that today’s immigrants to the United States continue to succeed economically to at least the same extent as those of earlier eras. Children of immigrants do even better economically than children of the native born. Immigrants erroneously seen as slow to assimilate (for instance, the Irish in the nineteenth century and Central Americans today) in fact assimilate the fastest. More surprising, immigrants rarely compete for jobs and success with native-born workers. They are a source of entrepreneurial and scientific talent that benefits the country as a whole. This evidence-based analysis leads the authors to recommend less restrictive immigration policies."
40,The Journey of Humanity: The Origins of Wealth and Inequality,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/journey-humanity-origins-wealth-and-inequality,The Journey of Humanity: The Origins of Wealth and Inequality,"To call this book ambitious is an understatement. The author offers a unified account of the development of living standards over the course of human history. Galor attributes the stagnation of incomes for 99 percent of history to the Malthusian trap—to the tendency for populations to grow in response to technological progress that raises incomes, putting pressure on the land until living standards fall back to subsistence levels. But he also links the acceleration of technological progress to population growth, arguing that more people made for more inventors and more successful inventions. As technological progress accelerated, societies reached a tipping point. Parents realized that to succeed in a quickly changing world, their offspring had to be equipped with education and skills to enable them to adapt; this expensive investment in children in turn required fertility control. From this point, population growth no longer responded positively to technological progress, and living standards took off. The argument ranges over the roles of culture, institutions, and genetics in economic development and underdevelopment. One need not agree with the author that his framework is entirely novel to be provoked."
41,The Downfall of the American Order?,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/downfall-american-order,The Downfall of the American Order?,"This engaging collection of essays brings distinguished scholars of political economy together to explore the changing faces of economic liberalism within the U.S.-led postwar international order. Kirshner considers the role of Keynesian ideas in the postwar efforts to find a “third way” between unfettered markets and planned economies. Mark Blyth offers a revisionist account of the establishment of the initial U.S.-led order between World War II and the 1970s, stressing not the farsighted power of planners in Washington but accidents and improvisations driven by Cold War imperatives. Rawi Abdelal makes the provocative argument that the neoliberalism that came to the fore in the 1980s was the work of European thinkers, not American ones, and that it ushered in growth and prosperity in the global South even as it generated economic inequality and financial instability in the North. Katzenstein offers trenchant observations on the complexity and contingency of the evolution of liberalism in all its varieties across the last century. The value of this volume is not in a shared judgment about the future of the U.S.-led international order but in the richness of the debate about how orders, liberal and otherwise, are shaped and reshaped."
42,Where the Evidence Leads: A Realistic Strategy for Peace and Human Security,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/where-evidence-leads-realistic-strategy-peace-and-human-security,Where the Evidence Leads: A Realistic Strategy for Peace and Human Security,"In this ambitious and masterful study, Johansen advances a set of sweeping principles and strategies for peace-building and security in the twenty-first century. Driving the book is a sustained critique of realist-inspired U.S. foreign policy, which may have served U.S. interests during the Cold War but which is now completely incapable of grappling with today’s planetary threats and dangers. Johansen hopes for a paradigm shift in Washington’s global security strategy, one that recognizes that the United States must reckon with the declining utility of war, the rise of nonstate actors, the proliferation of transnational problems such as climate change, and the growth of world poverty and desolation. If this new vision is to take hold, activists and transnational social movements will need to lead the way. Johansen’s eloquent appeal for new thinking is inspired by cosmopolitanism and deep moral conviction, but his eye remains firmly fixed on how policymakers in the real world can shift their priorities to move the United States and the rest of the world closer to the realization of unifying human ideals."
43,Rules: A Short History of What We Live By,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/rules-short-history-what-we-live,Rules: A Short History of What We Live By,"In this intimidatingly erudite tour de force, Daston offers a sweeping global history of the rise and evolution of rules in societies and civilizations. Most of what Daston uncovers is hidden in plain sight. Rules emerged and proliferated everywhere to support and constrain human activity, ranging from the simple (rules for driving, tipping in a restaurant, and when to leave a dinner party) to the intricate and world-spanning (rules for managing the global economy, fighting wars, and pursuing scientific research). Daston’s history suggests that rules have proliferated in the last two millennia, creating a “cat’s cradle of complexity almost as complex as culture itself.” She argues that since Greco-Roman antiquity, rules have taken three forms: tools of measurement and calculation, models or paradigms, and laws. Using these categories, the book ranges omnivorously across monastic orders, cookbooks, mechanical calculations, military manuals, and legal treaties. Daston traces an arc of development from the ancient era to modern times that moves from a world of high variability and unpredictability to a more predictable and knowable world. But there is no inexorable logic of modernity at work in the evolution of rules; in the past and the present, rules can be used both to liberate and to oppress."
44,The Age of the Strongman: How the Cult of the Leader Threatens Democracy Around the World,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/age-strongman-how-cult-leader-threatens-democracy-around-world,The Age of the Strongman: How the Cult of the Leader Threatens Democracy Around the World,"Rachman provides one of the most vivid and incisive accounts yet of the new authoritarianism that has swept the world. In Brazil, China, Hungary, India, the Philippines, Poland, Russia, Turkey, and the United States, a diverse cohort of would-be authoritarian leaders have emerged, each seeking to establish personalistic forms of one-man rule by serving up political cocktails of fear, grievance, nationalism, and reactionary populism. What Rachman finds most interesting is that the strongman model of rule has grown in both democratic and autocratic systems. From former U.S. President Donald Trump to Russian President Vladimir Putin, strongman leaders cement their hold on power through a cult of personality, contempt for the rule of law, and populist attacks on the elite establishment and the liberal consensus of the 1990s. In country after country, strongman leaders appeal to people “left behind” in rural areas and small towns, invoking nostalgia for a lost glorious past. Rachman argues that the strongman ethos is deeply rooted in global economic and technological changes and in the failures of and disillusionment with liberal democracy. But strongmen have their own weaknesses: personalistic rule cannot last forever, and dictators are rarely able to deliver what they promise."
45,Liberalism and Its Discontents,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/liberalism-and-its-discontents,Liberalism and Its Discontents,"In this learned work, Fukuyama shows that liberalism’s great advantage over rival ideologies in the modern era has been its ability to create the political conditions that allow for the coexistence of an array of hallowed but often contradictory values: liberty, equality, individualism, and community. He argues that liberalism is now being challenged from both the right and the left, as older compromises over class and culture have broken down. Progressives decry liberalism as neoliberalism, as manifest in ruinous financial crises and growing inequality. Conservatives point to the elevation of personal autonomy and identity politics as a threat to traditional religious and cultural beliefs. According to Fukuyama, the extreme versions of these critiques will lead not to reform, compromise, and a rebalancing of principles but to a deeply divisive postliberal future. Right-wing forces may push their societies in the direction of authoritarianism, while those on the left will seek a more systemic redistribution of wealth and power, as well as the greater formal recognition of group, rather than individual, rights. Fukuyama sees the right-wing threats to liberalism as much more immediate and existential. But if liberalism is to survive, partisans across the political spectrum will need to find new grand compromises, rediscovering and forging national traditions of universal civic rights and shared political community."
46,The World Tech Made,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/world-tech-made,The World Tech Made,"“We are as gods and might as well get used to it.” So began Stewart Brand’s introduction to the first issue of The Whole Earth Catalog, an encyclopedic compendium of resources for back-to-the-land living that became a foundational document of Silicon Valley’s techno-utopian culture. The Catalog departed from typical countercultural fare in seeking to impart technological know-how to commune dwellers. It included the use of handheld calculators and treatises on information theory among its recommended essentials for self-sufficient living. Such skills and knowledge, Brand explained, were hoarded by big corporations, government agencies, schools, and churches. It was time to return power to the people and give them the tools to shape their individual destinies."
47,The Unwinnable War,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/unwinnable-war-america-blind-spots-afghanistan,The Unwinnable War,"In August 2021, Afghanistan was thrust back into the headlines. Taliban forces rapidly closed in on Kabul, and the United States began making its final military withdrawal. Suddenly, the world was confronted with images of desperate people squeezing their way into Kabul’s airport for a chance to flee. Almost overnight, nearly everything that the United States and its allies had accomplished in 20 years of fighting, spending, and building in Afghanistan disintegrated. For the one million or so Americans who had taken part in those failed endeavors, and for the millions of young Afghans who had grown up under a Western-backed democracy, flawed though it was, such losses were head spinning. With their livelihoods imperiled, and with many fearful for their lives, hundreds of thousands of Afghans sought to leave the country, posing a new challenge for withdrawing Western forces."
48,Good at Being Bad,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/good-at-being-bad-how-dictatorships-endure,Good at Being Bad,"In the early 1980s, the great scholar of democracy Robert Dahl observed that “in much of the world the conditions most favorable to the development and maintenance of democracy are nonexistent, or at best only weakly present.” Barely had Dahl penned these pessimistic words when it became clear that democracy was on the verge of its greatest historical efflorescence. During the late twentieth century, a democratic wave engulfed the globe, toppling dictator­ships in Africa, Asia, Latin America, southern and eastern Europe, and the Soviet Union. By the beginning of the present century, the world had more democracies than ever before."
49,Boom and Bust,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/boom-and-bust,Boom and Bust,"Brad DeLong’s highly anticipated economic history of the twentieth century, Slouching Towards Utopia, begins with the reminder that economic growth is overwhelmingly a twentieth-century phenomenon. According to the best estimate, between the birth of Jesus and the beginning of the eighteenth century, the living standard of an average person rose by barely one third—1.5 percent every 100 years. Even after 1750, when the economy began appreciably expanding thanks to the steam engine, improvements in the welfare of a typical person remained paltry, scarcely doubling over 120 years in the global North as the benefits of economic expansion were matched by population growth. It was only in the late nineteenth century that the economy began growing notably faster than the population, allowing living standards to meaningfully increase."
50,Africa’s Past Is Not Its Future,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/africa/africa-past-not-its-future-mo-ibrahim,Africa’s Past Is Not Its Future,"Africa is a vast and abundant continent. Roughly ten times the size of India and three times the size of China, it is home to nearly 18 percent of the world’s population and roughly 30 percent of its mineral resources. With an average per capita GDP of just over $2,000, however, it remains the poorest continent by far. Of the 46 countries the United Nations has rated as the least developed, 35 are African. More than three-quarters of the continent’s population lives in countries where life expectancy, income, and education are well below the global mean. Africa, as the Ghanaian diplomat Kofi Annan once said, “is a rich continent with many, many poor people.”"
51,After Neoliberalism,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/united-states/after-neoliberalism-all-economics-is-local-rana-foroohar,After Neoliberalism,"For most of the last 40 years, U.S. policymakers acted as if the world were flat. Steeped in the dominant strain of neoliberal economic thinking, they assumed that capital, goods, and people would go wherever they would be the most productive for everyone. If companies created jobs overseas, where it was cheapest to do so, domestic employment losses would be outweighed by consumer benefits. And if governments lowered trade barriers and deregulated capital markets, money would flow where it was needed most. Policymakers didn’t have to take geography into account, since the invisible hand was at work everywhere. Place, in other words, didn’t matter."
52,The Age of Inflation,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/world/age-of-inflation-kenneth-rogoff,The Age of Inflation,"Coming on the heels of the pandemic-induced economic slowdown, the inflation crisis of the past two years seemed to catch much of the world by surprise. After three decades in which prices grew slowly across the world’s advanced economies, suddenly the United Kingdom, the United States, and the eurozone were contending with near or above double-digit inflation. Prices across many emerging markets and developing economies have risen even faster, for example, with inflation exceeding 80 percent in Turkey and nearing 100 percent in Argentina."
53,The Rewards of Rivalry,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/united-states/rewards-rivalry-us-china-competition-can-spur-climate-progress,The Rewards of Rivalry,"In many ways, competition between the United States and China is just that—a rivalry between two powerful countries. But it is also much more than that. This is a contest not only between two rival states but also between two rival hierarchies. As the United States and China square off against each other, they are also vying for the allegiance of countries across the globe."
54,The Real China Hands,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/united-states/real-china-hands-what-us-can-learn-from-asian-allies,The Real China Hands,"For four years, as an increasingly belligerent China breathed down their necks, the United States’ allies in Asia quietly endured a torrent of abuse from President Donald Trump. Under President Joe Biden, they again have a winning hand in Washington. By the time he took office, Biden, a leading optimist about cooperation with China when he was vice president, had transformed into a hardened skeptic. He has promoted key alliance builders to the top Asia posts at the National Security Council, the State Department, and the Pentagon and ensured that his first in-person summit was with Yoshihide Suga, then Japan’s prime minister. His administration has elevated the Quad (Quadrilateral Security Dialogue), the group linking the United States with Australia, India, and Japan, to a regular summit and agreed to help Australia build nuclear-powered submarines under the AUKUS pact with that country and the United Kingdom. The White House’s Indo-Pacific strategy, issued in February 2022, mentioned allies or alliances more than 30 times in a 19-page document. China merited only two references."
55,Mexico’s Dying Democracy,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/mexico/mexico-dying-democracy-amlo-toll-authoritarian-populism-denise-dresser,Mexico’s Dying Democracy,"When Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador took office four years ago, he promised to deliver what he branded a “Fourth Transformation,” the next in a series of defining junctures in Mexican history: the War of Independence in the early 1800s, the liberal movement of President Benito Juárez later that century, and the Revolution of 1910. To “make Mexico great again,” he said he would fight deeply ingrained corruption and eradicate persistent poverty. But in the name of his agenda, López Obrador has removed checks and balances, weakened autonomous institutions, and seized discretionary control of the budget. Arguing that police forces cannot stop the country’s mounting insecurity, he has supplanted them with the Mexican military and endowed it with unprecedented economic and political power. Today, the armed forces carry out his bidding on multiple fronts and have become a pillar of support for the government. López Obrador, or AMLO as he is known, seems intent on restoring something akin to the dominant-party rule that characterized Mexican politics from 1929 to 2000, but with a militarized twist."
56,Why American Power Endures,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/united-states/why-american-power-endures-us-led-order-isnt-in-decline-g-john-ikenberry,Why American Power Endures,"For over a century, people around the world have lived through an American era: a period dominated by U.S. power, wealth, institutions, ideas, alliances, and partnerships. But many now believe this long epoch is drawing to a close. The U.S.-led world, they insist, is giving way to something new—a post-American, post-Western, postliberal order marked by great-power competition and the economic and geopolitical ascendance of China."
57,The Sources of Russian Misconduct,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/russian-federation/sources-russia-misconduct-boris-bondarev,The Sources of Russian Misconduct,"For three years, my workdays began the same way. At 7:30 a.m., I woke up, checked the news, and drove to work at the Russian mission to the United Nations Office in Geneva. The routine was easy and predictable, two of the hallmarks of life as a Russian diplomat."
58,Russia’s Dangerous Decline,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/ukraine/russia-dangerous-decline,Russia’s Dangerous Decline,"At a White House ceremony on August 9, days after the U.S. Senate agreed in a near-unanimous vote to ratify the expansion of NATO to include Finland and Sweden, U.S. President Joe Biden highlighted how Russia’s invasion of Ukraine had backfired on Russian President Vladimir Putin. “He’s getting exactly what he did not want,” Biden announced. “He wanted the Finlandization of NATO, but he’s getting the NATOization of Finland, along with Sweden.” Indeed, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has been a massive strategic blunder, leaving Russia militarily, economically, and geopolitically weaker."
59,The World According to Xi Jinping,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/china/world-according-xi-jinping-china-ideologue-kevin-rudd,The World According to Xi Jinping,"In the post–Cold War era, the Western world has suffered no shortage of grand theories of history and international relations. The settings and actors may change, but the global geopolitical drama goes on: variants of realism and liberalism compete to explain and predict state behavior, scholars debate whether the world is witnessing the end of history, a clash of civilizations, or something else entirely. And it is no surprise that the question that now attracts more analytical attention than any other is the rise of China under President Xi Jinping and the challenge it presents to American power. In the run-up to the 20th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), as Xi has maneuvered to consolidate his power and secure an unprecedented third term, Western analysts have sought to decode the worldview that drives him and his ambitions for China."

0,Would China Go Nuclear?,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2018-12-11/would-china-go-nuclear,Would China Go Nuclear?,"I read with interest Caitlin Talmadge’s article “Beijing’s Nuclear Option” (November/December 2018), in which she quotes me estimating in 2015 that the odds of a U.S.-Chinese nuclear exchange were “somewhere between nil and zero.” She then goes on to make a case against remaining complacent in the face of the risk of escalation, with no discussion of what is in fact a very high nuclear threshold in a U.S.-Chinese confrontation or conflict. I continue to believe that the chances of nuclear use are very small."
1,The Crisis of Peacekeeping,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/crisis-peacekeeping,The Crisis of Peacekeeping,"In nearly 50 conflict zones around the world, some one and a half billion people live under the threat of violence. In many of these places, the primary enforcers of order are not police officers or government soldiers but the blue-helmeted troops of the United Nations. With more than 78,000 soldiers and 25,000 civilians scattered across 14 countries, UN peacekeepers make up the second-largest military force deployed abroad, after the U.S. military."
2,Life After Liberation,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/review-essay/2018-12-11/life-after-liberation,Life After Liberation,"Welcome to the Wild East. First, there are Bulgarian Gypsies with dancing bears. Then there is a Polish village whose inhabitants dress up as Hobbits from The Lord of the Rings, along with Gandalf, played by a woman, and Gollum—in private life a farmer who receives European Union subsidies. There are hundreds of thousands of communist-era bunkers in Albania, some of them now being demolished by men in search of rebar. Meanwhile, a Serbian remembers being “treated” by the former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic in Belgrade, where the notorious war criminal was in hiding, disguised in a ponytail and beard and pretending to be a faith healer: “At one point he told me that cosmic energy came to him via the hair and beard.” And to cap it all off, a Georgian woman dreams of Joseph Stalin visiting her at night: “He gazes at me, puffs on his pipe, and twirls his moustache. He smiles, and then heads for the door. Then I weep and cry for him to stay.”"
3,The Eroding Balance of Terror,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/eroding-balance-terror,The Eroding Balance of Terror,"Thus far the chief purpose of our military establishment has been to win wars,” the American nuclear strategist Bernard Brodie wrote in 1946. “From now on its chief purpose must be to avert them.” Brodie’s injunction summed up the grim lesson of the first five decades of the twentieth century: after two horrific world wars and the development of nuclear weapons, it was clear that the next major conflict would produce no winners—only survivors. As U.S. President John F. Kennedy put it a decade and a half later, in the midst of the Cuban missile crisis, “Even the fruits of victory would be ashes in our mouth.” For decades, U.S. policymakers followed Brodie’s and Kennedy’s lead, putting deterrence—preventing rivals from attacking in the first place—at the center of U.S. defense strategy."
4,"More, Less, or Different?",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/review-essay/2018-12-11/more-less-or-different,"More, Less, or Different?","Since November 2016, the U.S. foreign policy community has embarked on an extended voyage of soul-searching, filling the pages of publications like this one with essays on the past, present, and future of the liberal international order and the related question of where U.S. grand strategy goes from here. The prevailing sentiment is not for just more of the same. Big questions are up for debate in ways they have not been for many years. What is the purpose of U.S. foreign policy? Are there fundamental changes in the world that demand a corresponding change in approach?"
5,The Age of Uneasy Peace,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/china/age-uneasy-peace,The Age of Uneasy Peace,"In early October 2018, U.S. Vice President Mike Pence delivered a searing speech at a Washington think tank, enumerating a long list of reproaches against China. From territorial disputes in the South China Sea to alleged Chinese meddling in U.S. elections, Pence accused Beijing of breaking international norms and acting against American interests. The tone was unusually blunt—blunt enough for some to interpret it as a harbinger of a new Cold War between China and the United States."
6,Islamist Terrorism in Europe,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2018-12-11/islamist-terrorism-europe,Islamist Terrorism in Europe,"This sober and detailed analysis of Islamist terrorism in Europe generalizes not just from the attacks that have succeeded but also from the over two-thirds of planned attacks that have been foiled. Nesser shows that although their basic goals are constant, Islamist terrorists adapt their tactics with the times. In recent years, heightened security has made complex bombings and aircraft hijackings all but impossible—so terrorists have gone minimalist. Attacks today tend to be one-man operations, carried out with vans and knives. Most perpetrators are refugees or European-born jihadists. They are almost always motivated by religion, and they communicate with outside groups through encrypted messaging tools, such as WhatsApp. This form of terrorism is, as Nesser says, “less lethal, but almost impossible to stop.” So although the annual European death toll from terrorism is far below what it was during the 1970s and 1980s, the number of attacks is higher than ever. Nesser concludes that military operations abroad do less to quash terrorism than sound policing at home. Police, he says, should focus on stopping “entrepreneurs”—skilled jihadist activists who assist perpetrators—through aggressive surveillance. He ends on a pessimistic note, but perhaps the striking decline in successful European terrorist attacks over the past year would lead him to reconsider his conclusion."
7,The Empire’s New Clothes: The Myth of the Commonwealth,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2018-12-11/empires-new-clothes-myth-commonwealth,The Empire’s New Clothes: The Myth of the Commonwealth,"Murphy, the director of the University of London’s Institute of Commonwealth Studies, argues that the Commonwealth of Nations does not exist. Formally, to be sure, the organization encompasses one-third of the world’s population in its 53 postimperial member states. Queen Elizabeth II is its titular head, Prince Charles is her presumed successor, and Prince Harry and his wife, Meghan, are freshly minted Commonwealth youth ambassadors. Euroskeptics profess a deep faith that Brexit offers a golden opportunity for the United Kingdom to reembrace the Commonwealth, thereby unleashing a bonanza of trade and investment. Yet all of this, Murphy argues, is little more than pomp and circumstance. Commonwealth members disagree about almost everything, even basic human rights. The organization coddles “a grim collection of charlatans, chancers and outright villains.” Decades ago, citizens of member countries could immigrate to the United Kingdom, but no more. The United Kingdom still grants Commonwealth members preferential tariffs, but only through common eu rules: the threat of exclusion from the European market means Commonwealth leaders have unanimously denounced Brexit. Murphy ends by encouraging the United Kingdom to shed its post-imperial delusions—even though that may put him out of a job."
8,Empires of the Weak: The Real Story of European Expansion and the Creation of the New World Order,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/empires-weak-real-story-european-expansion-and-creation-new-world-order,Empires of the Weak: The Real Story of European Expansion and the Creation of the New World Order,"The imperialism through which France, Spain, the United Kingdom, and other European countries came to dominate the globe was not simply a function of superior military technology, naval power, or administrative organization. Europeans were rarely in a position to dominate the world solely by means of their military might. Instead, they subtly co-opted foreign elites by trading with them, hiring them as mercenaries, supporting them in their struggles against local enemies, and, if all else failed, bribing them or blockading their ports. Sometimes the spread of infectious diseases did the work. This adds up to a more nuanced story than one might think, although Sharman does admit that this informal imperialism ran out of steam in the late nineteenth century, when Europe simply rolled over Africa. Anyone even slightly familiar with the historical literature will be baffled by the book’s repeated claims of originality for a thesis that echoes (daringly, without citation) the ideas of Karl Marx, Ronald Robinson and John Gallagher, and generations of eminent historians of empire. Yet in an era when great-power competition seems to be on the rise, this book reminds readers that few, if any, modern nations have ever been strong enough to dominate all those around them through brute force alone."
9,Berlin,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2018-12-11/berlin,Berlin,"Berlin under the Weimar Republic was a crucible that helped forge modern society and politics. Its violent partisan conflicts, extreme disparities between social classes, floods of rural and foreign migrants, and fluid cultural and gender identities set the tone for urban life ever after. Lutes, a legendary artist, devoted two decades to this magisterial graphic novel. Its multilayered story line follows a set of loosely connected characters in Berlin between 1928 and 1933. A young girl from the provinces arrives in Berlin and is swept up in a world of convinced Communists, militant Nazis, disillusioned Social Democrats, conservative businessmen, impoverished workers, dissipated elites, spirited youth exploring new life-styles, and Jews seeking to preserve ancient identities—as well as cruel police, tortured drug addicts, wounded veterans, black jazz musicians, and closeted gay people. Some of the events Lutes portrays are grim, others inspiring, and still others confusing and troubling. Throughout, one is constantly aware of an eerie resemblance to today’s world."
10,Plugging In the British: Completing the Circuit,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2018-12-11/plugging-british-completing-circuit,Plugging In the British: Completing the Circuit,"Brexit has proved surprisingly difficult to implement, not just in economic affairs, where analysts always expected problems, but in many other areas, too. The EU quietly coordinates European policy on development, human rights, sanctions, policing, human trafficking, external border control, military missions, diplomacy, the un, defense industries, cybersecurity, intelligence sharing, space exploration, scientific research, judicial cooperation, and much more. Many of these policies were created with strong British support. So Brexiteers confront the same basic dilemma that they face on economic issues: defending vital British interests requires that most cooperation with Europe remain unchanged, yet domestic politics dictates that the final result be spun as something totally new. Even limiting the exercise to mere political rebranding requires changes in the legal form or underlying substance of thousands of rules, regulations, and procedures. Since it would be unacceptable to the other 27 EU members for London to pick and choose when and how it cooperates with its neighbors, the result has been a series of deadlocked talks. This tidy little report summarizes the major issues. The authors show that sober negotiations could preserve most current cooperation under another name—but that the changes that must occur will generally disadvantage the United Kingdom."
11,The Ideas That Made America: A Brief History,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2018-12-11/ideas-made-america-brief-history,The Ideas That Made America: A Brief History,"Ratner-Rosenhagen teaches intellectual history at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, and if this concise book is any indication of what her courses are like, her students can count themselves fortunate. She offers a brisk walk through the American intellectual tradition, from New England Puritanism to modern pragmatism. Ratner-Rosenhagen’s determination to incorporate the full spectrum of American thought—for example, from the abolitionist Frederick Douglass to the pro-slavery theorist George Fitzhugh—clashes with her desire to impose order on her procession of thinkers, and some of her assessments, such as the high place she gives the critic and journalist Margaret Fuller in American intellectual history, would be more convincing if she provided readers with a more expansive account of the work in question. Nevertheless, her curiosity about ideas, her determination to understand a diverse set of authors and points of view on their own terms, and her conviction that the messiness of the American intellectual tradition is an essential feature of American life make this book a stimulating read."
12,"Grand Improvisation: America Confronts the British Superpower, 1945–1957",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/grand-improvisation-america-confronts-british-superpower-1945-1957,"Grand Improvisation: America Confronts the British Superpower, 1945–1957","Contemporaries experience the history of their times as full of chaos and improvisation; historians try to find patterns in the maelstrom. The decade after World War II was especially uncertain. Nobody in 1946 understood the depth of the United Kingdom’s exhaustion or the severity of the Soviet challenge. American public opinion strongly favored rapid demobilization and military withdrawal from Europe. Leebaert’s history of the U.S.-British relationship from V-E Day to the aftermath of the 1956 Suez crisis highlights this complexity and attacks the widespread view that the immediate postwar period saw a smooth handoff of world power from London to Washington. In his telling, far from ceding the world to the Americans, the British fought tenaciously to preserve their strategic independence. American strategists were ambivalent, confused, and lacked the coherent grand designs for a liberal international order that historians would later attribute to them. Leebaert’s revisionism is not always convincing, but he is right to challenge the narrative of a seamless transition—and right, too, that a sentimentalized vision of this history will make it harder for policymakers to deal with the enormous challenges facing the United States in the twenty-first century."
13,Lords of the Desert: The Battle Between the United States and Great Britain for Supremacy in the Modern Middle East,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2018-12-11/lords-desert-battle-between-united-states-and-great-britain,Lords of the Desert: The Battle Between the United States and Great Britain for Supremacy in the Modern Middle East,"The British Labour government that took power in the summer of 1945 soon concluded that keeping as much of the Middle East’s oil as possible under British rule—and thus within the sterling zone—offered the best, perhaps the only, hope of maintaining the United Kingdom’s place in the first rank of world powers. This conviction became the lodestar of postwar British policy. At first, the prospects looked good. Pro-British monarchs ruled in Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Libya, and the Gulf kingdoms. There were, however, two problems with the plan: Arab nationalists wanted no part of British rule, and the United States was willing and able to displace the United Kingdom as the dominant regional power. As Barr describes, the United States did indeed gradually marginalize the United Kingdom in the Middle East. This is a gripping story, and Barr, a gifted narrative historian, tells it well, casting light on both the history of the U.S. presence in the modern Middle East and the dilemmas U.S. policy continues to face there today."
14,Reconstruction: A Concise History,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2018-12-11/reconstruction-concise-history,Reconstruction: A Concise History,"The failure of Reconstruction remains a pivotal event in U.S. history, and the changing ways in which successive generations of historians have understood the period illustrate the dramatic shifts in American attitudes on race over the last 140 years. For almost a century after the Civil War, white southerners and their allies dominated the study of Reconstruction. Their narrative—of southern whites uniting to overthrow corrupt and incompetent governments that were maintained by federal bayonets—was received almost everywhere as gospel. Beginning in the civil rights era, however, historians shifted their focus to the nobility of Reconstruction’s central aim: ensuring equal rights for newly freed slaves. Guelzo offers a concise, clear, and temperate account of one of the most complex periods in U.S. history. Unlike earlier historians, he never loses sight of the cause of the newly free. But he points to the lack of political experience that left Reconstruction-era southern governments vulnerable to pressure from wealthy and wily white oligarchs. Guelzo also underscores the collapse of political will in the North for a long-term occupation, which is what a serious Reconstruction strategy would have required. In his telling, Reconstruction emerges as a terrible but probably inevitable tragedy."
15,Fear: Trump in the White House,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2018-12-11/fear-trump-white-house,Fear: Trump in the White House,"In this, the latest of Woodward’s 12 books of instant history based on insider access to the White House, the author spotlights the struggles of the often dysfunctional Trump administration. Some of the divisions he chronicles pit professional staffers against Trump family members. Others reflect the personality clashes typical of every high-pressure workplace, although they are more acute than usual in the Trump White House because the president’s inner circle includes so many outsize egos. The most significant battles, in Woodward’s telling, were those between a protectionist, “America first” president and his like-minded staffers on one side and the more globalist and pro-free-trade officials on the other. Trump sought to make policy choices, such as withdrawing from the World Trade Organization, that filled his staff with horror. Like Sir Humphrey Appleby in the British television show Yes Minister, the internationalists did what they could to delay him. His impulses thwarted, Trump grew frustrated and lashed out. There matters rested when Woodward finished his book; since then, it appears, Trump has started imposing his will on his officials. It will be interesting, to put it mildly, to see what comes next."

Bushnell was the U.S. ambassador to Kenya at the time and was caught up in the blast that killed 213 people and left some 4,000 wounded. She describes how she had pressed for a more secure embassy before the bombing, the experience of the day itself, and the painful aftermath. The book is an autobiography, an investigation into the origins of the attack, and a lament about bureaucratic failings at the U.S. State Department, along with a discussion of how these might be addressed with better leadership. It is an angry book. Bushnell was told that she was overloading the circuits by pressing for better security, and the sloppy departmental response to the blasts still stings. Yet she also makes a compelling case that good diplomats can make a difference."
17,"Vietnam: An Epic Tragedy, 1945–1975; Road to Disaster: A New History of America’s Descent Into Vietnam",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2018-12-11/vietnam-epic-tragedy-1945-1975-road-disaster-new-history-americas,"Vietnam: An Epic Tragedy, 1945–1975; Road to Disaster: A New History of America’s Descent Into Vietnam","These two books take on a familiar topic but manage to be original and thought provoking—and very different from each other. Hastings covers the war from the Communists’ uprising against the French in 1945 to their victory over the South in 1975. As a foreign correspondent, he was one of the last to leave Saigon. In this masterly and engrossing account, he uses the same techniques that have served him well in his histories of the two world wars, exploring the war from the bottom up as well as the top down. He is scathing about delusionary U.S. decision-making and the hopeless efforts to compensate for the South’s political weakness by military means. But he is also harsh in his depiction of the callous North Vietnamese and the Vietcong. The strengths of the book lie in Hastings’ ability to describe, with extensive use of diaries, memoirs, and interviews, the chaos of battle in a war of ambushes and without obvious frontlines."
18,Haig’s Enemy: Crown Prince Rupprecht and Germany’s War on the Western Front; The First Soldier: Hitler as Military Leader,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2018-12-10/haigs-enemy-crown-prince-rupprecht-and-germanys-war-western-front,Haig’s Enemy: Crown Prince Rupprecht and Germany’s War on the Western Front; The First Soldier: Hitler as Military Leader,"Military history tends to be seen through the eyes of the victors, but these two books show the two world wars from the perspective of the defeated Germans. Archival research on German military decision-making during World War I has been hampered by the destruction of the bulk of the records in World War II. Boff has managed to fill some of the gaps by supplementing standard sources with the detailed diaries of Crown Prince Rupprecht of Bavaria. Rupprecht, who ended the war as a field marshal in the German army, was a constant presence on the western front, from the failure to achieve the planned gains in the original German offensive of 1914 to General Erich Ludendorff’s final push in 1918. This led to the Allied offensive that ended with Germany’s capitulation. Recent historians have argued that the Allies adapted well to the demands of this attritional warfare. Boff picks up on this theme by demonstrating that, despite their assumed operational superiority, the Germans adapted poorly."
19,Who Will Run the World?,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/issue-packages/2018-12-11/who-will-run-world,What’s Inside,"Two decades ago, the U.S.-sponsored liberal international order seemed to be going from strength to strength. Now, both order and sponsor are in crisis, and the future is up for grabs. There are many elements of the story—military and economic blunders, stagnation for the middle and lower classes in the developed world, a populist backlash against globalization, dizzying technological change—but a shifting balance of power may be the most important of all. That’s why we’ve focused on how the troubled hegemon and the confident challenger are trying to write the story’s next chapter."

Singapore, Stockholm, and Tokyo; parts of South Korea; and a scattering of U.S. cities have accomplished this. Crawford, who has visited many of those places and interviewed many people involved, castigates U.S. telephone and cable companies and their lawyers for actively discouraging the rollout of fiber-optic cables to houses and offices (even as they themselves use them). She berates them for their high prices, which they can charge because they often operate as local monopolies, which they want to preserve. Crawford ends her indictment of the current state of affairs—and the political system that permits it—with a call for a new federal initiative to install fiber-optic cables throughout the United States, modeled on past infrastructure programs, such as rural electrification and the building of the interstate highway system."
21,The Willing World: Shaping and Sharing a Sustainable Global Prosperity,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2018-12-11/willing-world-shaping-and-sharing-sustainable-global-prosperity,The Willing World: Shaping and Sharing a Sustainable Global Prosperity,"Bacchus, a former U.S. congressman and former chair of the appeals court of the World Trade Organization, is a strong advocate for international law, which he views as necessary for sustained global economic growth. In this book, he champions free foreign trade and free foreign investment, as long as they are subject to international rules and the right institutions are set up to settle inevitable disputes. He argues that the rules should be formulated to ensure sustainability and suggests that they should accord with the un’s Sustainable Development Goals, which set global targets for social and economic development by 2030. He also makes a persuasive case that international policies to address environmental issues, including both the global problem of climate change and more local ones, can boost economic growth rather than hurt it."
22,Discreet Power: How the World Economic Forum Shapes Market Agendas,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2018-12-11/discreet-power-how-world-economic-forum-shapes-market-agendas,Discreet Power: How the World Economic Forum Shapes Market Agendas,"For more than half a century, the World Economic Forum has organized an annual gathering of politicians, business executives, experts, and policymakers in Davos, Switzerland. The wef has no formal authority, but it has become a major forum for elites to discuss policy ideas and priorities. In this informative study, Garsten and Sorbom explore both the inner workings and the communication strategies of the WEF. They are troubled by its lack of democratic accountability, but it is difficult to replicate democratic institutions such as elected parliaments in international bodies. As appealing as an international parliament might be, the world is not likely to see one anytime soon, especially not one that can discuss complex issues in a common language rather than simply make speeches designed for domestic constituents. In the end, the authors conclude that the WEF does perform a useful service, even if it is biased toward elite perceptions."

Baldwin lays out various different attributes of working life, according to the different talents and industries involved. He then characterizes what kinds of things intelligent robots and remote workers, helped by better software and communications technology, can and can’t do today and what they’ll be able to do within the next few decades. Finally, he matches the two up to see which tasks and jobs will fall to automation. Baldwin argues that in the last century, most people moved from relying on their hands in their work to relying on their heads. In the future, they will have to rely on their hearts, because machines won’t be able to replicate such human abilities as nonverbal communication, compassion, creativity, and face-to-face contact. Many jobs that rely on these attributes will be safe from robots for decades. Artificial intelligence excels at classifying what it sees, searching huge databases, and recognizing patterns, but it cannot copy other, more human qualities."
24,Money and Government: The Past and Future of Economics,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2018-12-11/money-and-government-past-and-future-economics,Money and Government: The Past and Future of Economics,"This masterly exposition of the history of economic thought—and the context in which it developed—goes back to the seventeenth century but concentrates on the last hundred years. It sketches the historical background to the emergence of classical economics, monetarism, Keynesianism, and neoclassical economics. Skidelsky wrote a biography of John Maynard Keynes, so it’s not surprising that his interpretations of Keynes’ thought are especially subtle. As Skidelsky writes, Keynes emphasized unknowable uncertainty about the future, a contrast to the deterministic way that his theory, which served as the origin of modern macroeconomics, is usually presented in textbooks and taught to students. Skidelsky also offers an illuminating treatment of the 2008 financial crisis, the ways in which economists were blindsided by it, the monetary and fiscal policies that governments adopted in response, and the fragile and sometimes faltering recovery."
25,Protean Power: Exploring the Uncertain and Unexpected in World Politics,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2018-12-11/protean-power-exploring-uncertain-and-unexpected-world-politics,Protean Power: Exploring the Uncertain and Unexpected in World Politics,"International relations scholars have repeatedly found themselves surprised by grand historical upheavals: the Russian Revolution, the end of the Cold War, the 2008 financial crisis, the Arab Spring, Brexit, the election of Donald Trump. In this ambitious book, Katzenstein and Seybert argue that scholars need to rethink their assumptions about knowledge and uncertainty in world politics and equip themselves with new ideas about power and innovation. Theorists tend to see a world in which uncertainty can be reduced to calculable risk. This view of knowledge is like throwing a die: we don’t know what a specific throw will yield, but we do know the probability of each outcome. Katzenstein and Seybert argue that the world is just too complex and contingent for this kind of social inquiry. If the world is seen this way, leaders need to adopt more open-ended and improvisational forms of decision-making—what the authors call “protean power”: “a creatively generated shift in accepted problem-solving that circulates across different sites of political life.”"

Chowdhury makes a convincing case for the reality, not the myth, of international order. He notes that most countries in the world are weak, with wobbly central governments that fail to provide basic economic and social services—and yet they muddle through, thanks to an international order that protects all sovereign territorial states against their rivals. The myth that Chowdhury exposes is the realist narrative in which countries compete for survival in a state of Hobbesian anarchy. As Chowdhury shows, this classic model fits the European experience but little else. He argues that the wars of modern Europe convinced citizens to support centralized power and pay high taxes, whereas states outside the West, because they developed later, did not go through this cycle of war making and state building. That means the modern international order hits young countries with a double whammy: by dampening conflict, it makes it harder for them to grow strong while also raising the expectations for what governments must do when it comes to education, health care, and other social services. Chowdhury is surely correct that state building is harder now than a century ago. The challenge is to find peaceful incentives for effective governance."
27,Chaos in the Liberal Order: The Trump Presidency and International Politics in the Twenty-first Century,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2018-12-11/chaos-liberal-order-trump-presidency-and-international-politics,Chaos in the Liberal Order: The Trump Presidency and International Politics in the Twenty-first Century,"This sprawling set of 32 short essays is one of the first scholarly efforts to reckon with the Trump administration’s assault on the international liberal order. It is as lively as it is incoherent and inconclusive. As Jervis argues in the introduction, the Trump years provide, if nothing else, a chance for political scientists and historians to test their theories. The essays show that scholars differ on the sources of the crisis—whether President Donald Trump is the cause or the effect—and the scope of it. Realists look to the long-term decline of U.S. power. Others focus on Trump and the institution of the presidency, examining how the national security state constrains its leader. Scholars of international institutions see Trump’s presidency as a test of the theory that institutions and long-standing strategic bargains will prove resilient. Michael Barnett suggests that Trump is so unusual that he escapes the confines of most international relations theory—realist, liberal, or otherwise. The book also features a good debate over the resiliency of the liberal order; like most of the volume’s other discussions, it hinges on each author’s assumptions about the sources of political order and whether domestic political coalitions can be rebuilt around internationalism."
28,Authoritarianism: What Everyone Needs to Know,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2018-12-11/authoritarianism-what-everyone-needs-know,Authoritarianism: What Everyone Needs to Know,"After decades of retreat, authoritarianism is on the rise. This poses a political challenge to liberal democracies. But it also poses an intellectual challenge to scholars. In this short study, Frantz provides an illuminating guide to today’s authoritarian wave. Authoritarianism, she shows, is a moving target. It can take the form of strongman rulers, as in sub-Saharan Africa; autocratic regimes led by a party or the military, as in Latin America; or hereditary dictators, as in North Korea. Frantz is at her most insightful in her description of the ways in which authoritarian regimes have taken on “pseudo-democratic” characteristics in order to survive. Today, over 80 percent of dictatorships hold elections, for example. How authoritarianism arrives has changed, too. Military or elite coups are out of fashion, replaced by more gradual usurpations of power carried out through rigged elections and biased political rules. Turkey and the Philippines fit this model, with elected populists slowly dismantling the institutions of democracy. Authoritarians have new tools: the co-optation of institutions, the use of patronage networks, and the control of information. It is harder to fight back against this subtle democratic subversion, because a single moment of truth never occurs."
29,Identity: The Demand for Dignity and the Politics of Resentment,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2018-12-11/identity-demand-dignity-and-politics-resentment,Identity: The Demand for Dignity and the Politics of Resentment,"In the decades since writing his famous essay “The End of History?,” Fukuyama has explored an often forgotten yet critical dimension of liberal democracy: the desire for dignity. In an ideal world, citizens would ground their identity in their shared humanity. But now, people are seeking recognition in narrow identity groups, based on nationality, religion, sect, race, ethnicity, and gender. Identity politics has always existed, but leaders on the left and the right have exploited the fears created by economic and social upheavals to build political coalitions around particular groups and their demands for recognition. For Fukuyama, this is the greatest threat to liberal democracy. He sees the politics of resentment being expressed by Vladimir Putin in Russia, Xi Jinping in China, and Viktor Orban in Hungary—and, in only slightly less overt ways, in established liberal democracies. As Fukuyama writes, a sense of nation is essential for liberal democracy, precisely because it speaks to the human desire for identity and respect. The challenge is to foster an inclusive and civic-minded nationalism that appeals to humanity’s most generous spirit. Great forces of history are arrayed against that endeavor, so leaders and people across the liberal democratic world must turn it into an active political project."
30,Deepfakes and the New Disinformation War,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/world/2018-12-11/deepfakes-and-new-disinformation-war,Deepfakes and the New Disinformation War,"A picture may be worth a thousand words, but there is nothing that persuades quite like an audio or video recording of an event. At a time when partisans can barely agree on facts, such persuasiveness might seem as if it could bring a welcome clarity. Audio and video recordings allow people to become firsthand witnesses of an event, sparing them the need to decide whether to trust someone else’s account of it. And thanks to smartphones, which make it easy to capture audio and video content, and social media platforms, which allow that content to be shared and consumed, people today can rely on their own eyes and ears to an unprecedented degree."
31,America’s Long Goodbye,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/long-term-disaster-trump-foreign-policy,America’s Long Goodbye,"In the end, 2018 was not the year of U.S. foreign policy apocalypse. Normally, this would not be a cause for celebration. But given the anxiety about President Donald Trump and what his administration might do—pull out of NATO, start a war with Iran or North Korea—it was something to be grateful for. In fact, Trump’s first two years in office have been marked by a surprising degree of stability. The president has proved himself to be what many critics have long accused him of being: belligerent, bullying, impatient, irresponsible, intellectually lazy, short-tempered, and self-obsessed. Remarkably, however, those shortcomings have not yet translated into obvious disaster."
32,Trump Versus the Government,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2018-12-11/trump-versus-government,Trump Versus the Government,"As he reaches the halfway mark of his first term, President Donald Trump is finding the vast U.S. government to be both an instrument of and a frequent barrier to the implementation of policies that he desires. Reflecting on his frustrations, he might be amused by an old anecdote about the struggles of one of his predecessors. As the diplomat Charles Frankel recalled in his memoir, a White House visitor once presented a proposal to President John F. Kennedy. “That’s a first-rate idea,” Kennedy said. “Now we must see whether we can get the government to accept it.”"
33,The Stealth Superpower,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/china-plan-rule-asia,The Stealth Superpower,"“China will not, repeat, not repeat the old practice of a strong country seeking hegemony,” Wang Yi, China’s foreign minister, said last September. It was a message that Chinese officials have been pushing ever since their country’s spectacular rise began. For decades, they have been at pains to downplay China’s power and reassure other countries—especially the United States—of its benign intentions. Jiang Zemin, China’s leader in the 1990s, called for mutual trust, mutual benefit, equality, and cooperation in the country’s foreign relations. Under Hu Jintao, who took the reins of power in 2002, “peaceful development” became the phrase of the moment. The current president, Xi Jinping, insisted in September 2017 that China “lacks the gene” that drives great powers to seek hegemony."

Their tropical uniforms blazed brightly in the black-and-white photograph. Many of the children, including my mother and my uncle, were Bengali.

35,Africa Through an Economic Lens,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2018-12-11/africa-through-economic-lens,Africa Through an Economic Lens,"Sy, a former career International Monetary Fund economist, lays out the optimistic vision of how economic growth could transform Africa. The book can feel a little haphazard—it is partly cobbled together from a blog Sy wrote at the Brookings Institution—but it offers interesting prescriptions for how Africa can overcome the constraints to faster growth, from improving infrastructure to addressing the massive structural unemployment that results from Africa’s continuing rapid population growth. Sy often returns to the problem of mobilizing enough foreign and domestic investment, as capital shortages remain the most significant constraint on the rapid growth he thinks Africa can achieve. He is so bullish about the returns on investment in Africa that he does not view the rising debt burdens of countries such as Ghana, Nigeria, and Zambia as posing serious problems."
36,Africa: War and Conflict in the Twentieth Century,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2018-12-11/africa-war-and-conflict-twentieth-century,Africa: War and Conflict in the Twentieth Century,"This concise history of warfare in Africa in the twentieth century covers a large number of conflicts, from the wars of colonial conquest waged by European armies in the earliest parts of the century, to the participation of African troops in World War I and World War II, to interstate wars since decolonization. Some of these conflicts are well known; others, such as the wars to quell various rebellions during the colonial era, get little academic or popular attention. Given Stapleton’s previous scholarly work on South African military history, it is not surprising that the long section on the Second Boer War, from 1899 to 1902, is rather more detailed than the book’s cursory treatment of several bloodier conflicts, most notably the First and Second Congo Wars, from 1996 to 2003. Although maps of the different campaigns would have made the book easier to follow, Stapleton nonetheless offers a useful introduction to an important topic."

From the late 1910s onward, Tanzania had more cinemas than any other country in Africa, except South Africa, as well as a less segregated film-going experience, which allowed whites, Africans, and South Asians to attend the same shows. Fair recounts efforts by South Asian businesspeople to import films from India in the early twentieth century, and later from the entire world, to show on Tanzanian screens. By the 1950s, eight movie theaters catered to 16,000 people a week in the capital, Dar es Salaam, and became the city’s center of social and cultural life. Indian films, with their singing and dancing, were long local favorites, although American westerns were popular, as well. In the 1970s, blaxploitation movies, such as Shaft and Hell Up in Harlem, arrived and began to shape the fashion tastes of the young. Fair’s impressive versatility means she is equally at ease discussing midcentury international film distribution networks as she is explaining the local appeal of obscure Indian movies."

The authors of this concise and masterly introduction to the topic go some way toward filling that gap. The book starts by showing how international tax law disadvantages African governments. It then discusses the attempts by African states to tax multinational corporations, especially in the oil and mining sectors. The book then turns to formal and informal domestic tax systems. It has a tendency to gloss over the variation among countries, but it does provide powerful evidence for several important generalizations. First, foreign companies, especially in the extractive industries, pay remarkably little in taxes. Second, the richest Africans also pay very little and have managed to park enormous sums abroad. Third, African fiscal systems have done much better at taxing average Africans than they get credit for. Finally, that means African tax systems are highly regressive, with poorer citizens paying much higher rates than richer ones."

It was tasked with examining the recent events but also given a daunting broader mandate: to examine all forms of egregious bad government in Kenya since 1963. That meant that it was always likely to come under enormous pressure from Kenya’s corrupt and entrenched political class. The commission delivered its report in 2013. Slye, a legal expert, was its sole non-African member. This fascinating book delves into the fissures that emerged among the commissioners, why the international members of the commission issued a dissent from some of the body’s findings, and the broader implications of the commission’s work for Kenya and other postconflict societies. Slye’s book makes for compelling reading, whether he is discussing the personal foibles of the commissioners, the backroom negotiations and compromises that mark such work, the legal issues involved, or the broader context of Kenyan politics."

Because of the huge famine caused by the campaign, historians have given the communes a bad name. But Eisenman argues that after the famine, and especially in the early 1970s, the reorganized communes fostered a green revolution that laid the basis for the rapid economic growth of the post-Mao era. He uses previously unexamined data on the production of grain, pork, and edible oils to show that the communes enabled the state to take most of the farmers’ profits away from them, thereby suppressing rural consumption, and reinvest it in an effective agricultural extension program that popularized the use of new seeds, fertilizers, and machinery. This in turn freed some of the rural work force up for light industry. Starting in 1978, however, the communes were dissolved because, Eisenman argues, Deng Xiaoping’s faction wanted to remove the cap on peasant consumption in order to generate support for economic reforms. Eisenman’s analysis implies that Western scholars who once held up Maoist practices as a model for developing countries were not entirely wrong, at least when it came to lifting traditional peasant farmers out of the trap of low productivity and low investment."
41,Where the Party Rules: The Rank and File of China’s Communist State,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2018-12-11/where-party-rules-rank-and-file-chinas-communist-state,Where the Party Rules: The Rank and File of China’s Communist State,"The disciplined, top-down Chinese Communist Party, some 90 million strong, extends throughout the Chinese government, society, and economy like a nervous system: its health determines how well the central authorities can control what goes on in every part of the country. Scholars tend to think of the CCP as omnipresent, but Koss uses extensive archival and statistical research to show that its power varies from place to place. When the (now abandoned) one-child policy was in effect, for example, the ban on sex-selective abortions was implemented more fully where the local party apparatus was strong than where it was weak. Koss also shows that strong local party organizations are correlated with lower levels of tax evasion. But powerful local cells may also resist central policy more effectively than weak ones, as happened during the Great Famine of 1958–61 and the Cultural Revolution in the late 1960s. Surprisingly, variations in local party strength can be traced all the way back to the Sino-Japanese War of 1937–45, when peasant resistance to the Japanese spurred strong party growth in the areas immediately threatened by Japanese troops, whereas those areas outside the war zone did not have the same catalyst. Koss adds an important dimension to scholars’ understanding of how the Chinese system works—and of its vulnerabilities."

The movement is made up of North Korean defectors joined by activists from not only South Korea but also Canada, Japan, the United States, and Europe. They pursue a range of goals, from humanitarian assistance to regime change, and use a variety of methods, from smuggling information to the North Korean population through broadcasts and thumb drives to lobbying the UN Human Rights Council. Seoul and Washington support the activists when they want to put pressure on Pyongyang—and regard them as an inconvenience when they want to negotiate. Despite the movement’s lack of coordination, it has had some successes. Human rights conditions in the North are now more widely known. In 2013, the un created a commission of inquiry on human rights in the country, which issued a devastating report on the abuses. Pyongyang has responded with diplomatic and propaganda pushback and some cosmetic legal changes. But as is often the case with human rights work, the real impact on conditions on the ground awaits a political breakthrough in the North."

Part of the answer is that legacy politicians in democracies are able to exploit their families’ name recognition and local networks in their campaigns. Smith tests this insight by looking at how legacy candidates fared in Japan before and after 1994, when the country reformed its system for electing delegates to the lower house of the Diet. Under the pre-1994 system, each district elected more than one representative to the lower house, which enabled candidates to win with less than a majority and thus advantaged those with strong networks based on family connections. Legacy candidates became less numerous after the switch in 1994 to single-member districts. Even so, political dynasties still have an advantage, because local politicians have resisted the efforts of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party’s central party apparatus to nominate candidates with broader national appeal. And legacy candidates who make it to the Diet still have a better chance of being promoted to cabinet posts."

The narrative is dramatic and detailed, with little explicit judgment or analysis. Vivid impressions emerge: of Gandhi’s restless energy and frequent bouts of ill health; of his willingness to treat his wife, children, helpers, and followers as instruments of his will; of his hold over all sectors of India’s fissiparous population; and of the restraint with which the British treated him despite their anger at his constant troublemaking. Guha reveals Gandhi’s inconsistencies and confusions, as well as his titanic self-regard. Many other talented contenders for leadership in India disapproved of his behavior and politics. But Gandhi had remarkable success in promoting his idiosyncratic views on economics, caste, diet, sexuality, and political action. Although he failed to heal the tragic rift between Hindus and Muslims, he did much to create the overarching sense of national identity that has so far held India together."

Shen and Xia reveal harsh conflicts between the leaders of China and North Korea during the Korean War over who would command the two countries’ troops, who would control Korean railways, and how far to chase the Americans as they retreated in the face of the initial Chinese attack. In 1956, Mao Zedong was so angry with Kim Il Sung that he told Moscow he might use the 400,000 Chinese troops still in North Korea to “help Kim Il-sung correct his mistakes,” a thinly veiled proposal to depose him. But Mao later came to regard Kim as a loyal son, to the point of promising him that if the United States attacked the North, Kim could use China’s northeastern provinces as a rear area under his own command. Relations between Beijing and Pyongyang were strongest in the first half of the 1970s, when Mao and Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai took advantage of their negotiations with the United States to press North Korea’s case with Washington. In those years, Chinese aid helped North Korea reach what turned out to be the height of its prestige as a development model among some Third World nations."

Yet that does not detract from their quality. In a particularly excellent contribution, Francis Ghilès and Eckart Woertz analyze Tunisia’s phosphate-rich region of Gafsa, which is vital to the country’s economy but neglected by the central government, so it consistently produces labor activism and jihadism. Other contributors examine the illegal charcoal trade between Somalia and the United Arab Emirates, the oil-rich dictatorships around the Caspian Sea, the dynamics of cross-border environmental protests, the new social contract within the Gulf states, illegal fishing and piracy off the coast of Somalia, and the impact of energy subsidies on economic growth. The collection offers no big takeaways; indeed, there is no concluding chapter. Each story is one of almost bewildering complexity and contingency."

Its value comes from its lucid exposition of the Islamic Republic’s two main ideological and policy axes: the jihadists, embodied by the country’s founder, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, and the ijtihadists, the more flexible and rational pragmatists, two of whom, Mohammad Khatami and Hassan Rouhani, have been elected president. The current supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, bridges both camps but favors the jihadists. Saikal gives a good explanation of Iran’s illiberal pluralism and the checks and balances that operate among its institutions. He also leads the reader through a careful analysis of Iran’s relations with regional and global powers. Throughout, he rightly stresses the country’s resilience in the face of conflict and sanctions. For any foreign country, he says, war with this middle power would be extremely costly. He does not anticipate regime change, only shifts in the balance of power back and forth between the jihadists and the ijtihadists."

It also offers a useful history of the Baath Party’s dominance in Syria since 1966 and the near-total capture of the military and intelligence infrastructure by the minority Alawite sect, which was led first by Hafez al-Assad and since 2000 has been led by his son Bashar. Van Dam chronicles the efforts since 2011 to find a negotiated solution to the civil war, which has claimed at least 450,000 lives and displaced some six million people. He dismisses the possibility of an insider coup against Assad by the Alawites themselves and deplores the excessive idealism and lack of realpolitik displayed by outside forces, especially Western governments’ refusal to include Assad in any negotiated transition. Van Dam sees no way out in the short term, but nor does he feel that Assad can sustain a military victory even if, with Iranian and Russian help, he achieves one."

In 1915, he began to implement his scheme. Kieser’s portrait of Talaat shows this architect of genocide as a charming monster, brilliant tactician, and fanatical ideologue. Kieser’s prose is sometimes tangled, and his narrative can be confusing, but his tale is gripping and well researched. Talaat traded a wartime alliance with Germany for German silence in the face of an estimated 800,000 Armenian deaths. His actions left Weimar Germany morally blemished, and they scuttled the possibility that the Ottoman Empire might turn in a more liberal direction. After fleeing to exile in Berlin, Talaat was assassinated in 1921 by an Armenian militant. Even in death, Talaat cast a long shadow. Kieser argues that his movement served as “a paradigm” for the Nazi Party. He also debunks the notion that the rise of Kemal Ataturk in the 1920s marked a rupture with the Young Turks; rather, it was a continuation. Likewise, today, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan invokes the Ottoman nationalist themes popularized by Talaat."

He describes the places and people at the center of the struggle, from jihadists to secular feminists. His lengthy account of the death of U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens, in 2012, shows that Stevens was aware of the dangers he faced in Benghazi and took the calculated risk to go there anyway. Wehrey also gives a good sense of Libya’s division into two dominant factions, one based in Benghazi and aligned with Khalifa Haftar, the head of the Libyan National Army, and the other based in Misurata and Tripoli and with a major Islamist element. Wehrey sees Haftar as a real danger, a would-be military dictator in the mold of Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, with the backing of Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. On top of the domestic conflict, Wehrey shows that the Islamic State (or ISIS) has managed to establish a foothold in Libya between the two factions. Although he explains this mess effectively, Wehrey offers no way out of it."

The stark divisions between eastern and western Europe, he argues, are the result of decisions taken by each of the participants that “made very good sense at the time” and “were the product of a conscious choice between important alternatives.” Often leaders were oblivious to “unforeseen and unintended” consequences. Sometimes, they simply followed “the path of least resistance.” Hill uses abundant examples to trace more thoroughly than any other historian what has happened inside Russia and in its relations with NATO, the EU, and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe over the last 25 years. If Russia and Europe are to recover from their failures and build a system that includes Moscow, he concludes, these institutions will have to be either refurbished or replaced."

One of the more virulent and enduring is the phantasm of Judeo-Bolshevism—the notion that communism was, and remains, a Jewish plot. Hanebrink follows the myth’s twisted course from its European origins in the immediate aftermath of the Bolshevik Revolution, through the jaundiced politics of the interwar period, to its devastating culmination in Nazi Germany. Yet World War II did not kill it, and he picks up the story with its reappearance in postwar Eastern European politics, where it was exploited by those on both sides of the ideological divide. He argues that it survives today in the resurgent right-wing nationalism cropping up in many Western countries. From the start, the fantasy held that an alien element—the Jews—aimed to subvert the cultural values and national identities of Western societies. As Hanebrink points out, this theme is echoed in modern anti-Muslim conspiracy theories. The writers, politicians, and shills whose poisonous ideas he exhumes have many contemporary admirers."

Oleg Gordievsky was a true child of the KGB; his father and his brother were both dedicated lifelong officers. Gordievsky joined the international arm of the agency in the early 1960s, but he began to have doubts about the system he was serving. In 1973, while posted in Denmark, he was recruited by British intelligence. He would eventually rise to head the KGB operation in London. Over the years, he provided critical information to the West, bringing down Soviet spy operations in several European countries and in one instance alerting London and Washington to Moscow’s dangerous misreading of a NATO war game that could have led to nuclear disaster. The whole story, including Gordievsky’s return to Moscow, where, unbeknownst to him, he had been unmasked to the KGB by Aldrich Ames, their man in the cia, followed by his harrowing, made-for-Hollywood escape from the Soviet Union, unfolds with a pace and drama that recall the novels of John le Carré."

In the Soviet Union, something similar occurred in the less developed regions of the country, not least because Moscow wanted to prove that it could engineer economic development better than its capitalist competitors. In this original contribution, Kalinovsky outlines the calculations of the national and local figures who led the effort and then looks at the case of Tajikistan to explore how it worked in practice. He assesses specific elements of Soviet plans, such as the massive Nurek Dam, and their effects on the lives of those involved and the broader population. By the 1980s, in both the West and the East, early illusions about how easily the Western or the Soviet model of economic modernity could be cut and pasted onto traditional cultures had faded. As Kalinovsky shows, in the Soviet case, policymakers came to the awkward realization that instituting markets and at least partly preserving local traditions promised better results than state planning. But as the country came apart under Premier Mikhail Gorbachev, this belated awareness quickly succumbed to recriminations over the entire enterprise."

Winston Churchill, Franklin Roosevelt, and Joseph Stalin exchanged 682 messages between Nazi Germany’s attack on the Soviet Union, in June 1941, and Roosevelt’s death, in April 1945. Three-quarters of them are published here. Beyond the messages themselves, what makes this volume so valuable are the editors’ brisk and penetrating historical introductions and the context they provide for each message: the author’s mood and calculations, the political advice each leader was receiving, and sometimes the hidden diplomacy complementing the message. Scarcely any aspect of World War II has been more thoroughly written about than the relationships among these three leaders, but documenting their wartime communication in such detail gives new depth to this history. Stalin’s more cordial attitude toward Roosevelt than Churchill, for example, is unmistakable, as is the subtle shift in the dynamic among the three in Stalin’s favor beginning in 1943."

The concept covers all forms of assault short of war itself: cyberattacks, targeted propaganda, “little green men” (Russian “volunteers” appearing in Ukraine without insignia), aid to fringe opposition parties, and military threats. In this disciplined study, Fridman does not deny that Russia does all these things, but he is more interested in scraping away the misunderstandings surrounding the concept itself. He explains where the notion of hybrid war comes from, how Americans and Russians understand it differently, and, above all, why and how it has been deployed and politicized in the war in Ukraine. The idea of combining military force with other resources to sap an opponent’s will to fight is as old as war itself. But the modern concept of war fought by multiple means, on and off the battlefield, originated with the U.S. military over the course of several wars. The current, more expansive Russian version reflects what its Russian authors believe were the West’s own methods of waging the Cold War, which they now see being used against Russia once again."
57,After Insurgency: Revolution and Electoral Politics in El Salvador,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2018-12-11/after-insurgency-revolution-and-electoral-politics-el-salvador,After Insurgency: Revolution and Electoral Politics in El Salvador,"In 1992, a negotiated peace concluded El Salvador’s prolonged, bloody civil war and paved the way for an electoral democracy. The leftist insurgents emerged as a political party and eventually took the presidency. Sprenkels, who aided the guerrilla forces during the war, used his grass-roots contacts to conduct revealing interviews with wartime combatants. The book gives a nuanced, humane assessment of the lives of former revolutionaries in peacetime. Sprenkels avoids the simple tropes of postrevolutionary political disillusionment and moral decay. Rather, he identifies five peacetime narratives, each of which shows up among the former revolutionaries: permanent revolutionary pride amid social tensions; persistent civil war animosities and loyalties; the tendency to see politics as a conspiracy, often of the powerful against the poor; reliance on a system of patronage, with its logic of reciprocal exchange; and an emphasis on democratic citizenship. Particularly interesting is his discussion of the conversion of clandestine trust networks between former insurgent commanders and the rank and file into patronage systems. Sprenkels asks, “To what extent should we interpret post-insurgent clientelism as distinctly new?” Or were the former rebels simply absorbed into age-old methods of machine politics?"
58,"We Fed an Island: The True Story of Rebuilding Puerto Rico, One Meal at a Time",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2018-12-11/we-fed-island-true-story-rebuilding-puerto-rico-one-meal-time,"We Fed an Island: The True Story of Rebuilding Puerto Rico, One Meal at a Time","This book tells the inspiring story of the rapid response by Andrés, a celebrity chef and restaurateur, to the humanitarian crisis in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria. Although it isn’t a full-blown business school case study, it illustrates Andrés’ preferred model of social enterprise. He argues that those attempting to feed large populations should use professional supply-chain management, source ingredients locally, and hire expert chefs to prepare nutritious, high-calorie meals (in Puerto Rico, meat-and-vegetable stew, chicken-and-rice paella, and ham-and-cheese sandwiches). Andrés employed 20,000 volunteers across 24 kitchens, relying on seven local food trucks for distribution. Yet the book is more than the story of Andrés’ heroic efforts to feed Puerto Rico. It also offers a forceful indictment of the actions of the Trump administration and the Federal Emergency Management Agency, as well as those of various nongovernmental organizations. Andrés accuses U.S. President Donald Trump and his public relations team of carrying out blatantly misleading celebrations of the government’s grossly inadequate relief efforts and of cronyism in awarding FEMA contracts."

In Lindskoog’s view, prolonged detention—rather than release into the community on parole—violates international norms of human rights and U.S. constitutional guarantees of due process. Lindskoog examines the precedents for the system of mass incarceration of immigrants in U.S. policies toward Haitian immigrants since the 1970s and in the use of Guantánamo Bay for extraterritorial detention. Both Democratic and Republican administrations have resorted to detention to enforce immigration laws and deter additional waves of undocumented immigrants. Lindskoog provides a valuable road map of the tangled law and politics of U.S. immigration policies. He fails, however, to detail more humane alternatives to cope with the burgeoning flows of immigrants."
60,How a World Order Ends,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/world/how-world-order-ends,How a World Order Ends,"A stable world order is a rare thing. When one does arise, it tends to come after a great convulsion that creates both the conditions and the desire for something new. It requires a stable distribution of power and broad acceptance of the rules that govern the conduct of international relations. It also needs skillful statecraft, since an order is made, not born. And no matter how ripe the starting conditions or strong the initial desire, maintaining it demands creative diplomacy, functioning institutions, and effective action to adjust it when circumstances change and buttress it when challenges come."
61,The Fourth Founding,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2018-12-11/fourth-founding,The Fourth Founding,"The United States began as a radical experiment with grandiose ambitions. Its founders believed in Locke’s idea that free individuals could escape the perils of anarchy by joining together and cooperating for mutual benefit—and they created a country to show it wasn’t just talk. The signers of the Declaration of Independence bound themselves in a common political project, establishing a limited government to secure their rights and advance their interests. That act, noted Secretary of State John Quincy Adams in 1821, “was the first solemn declaration by a nation of the only legitimate foundation of civil government. It was the corner stone of a new fabric, destined to cover the surface of the globe.”"
62,The Free-Trade Paradox,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/united-states/free-trade-paradox,The Free-Trade Paradox,"“We must always take heed that we buy no more of strangers than we sell them, for so we should impoverish ourselves and enrich them.” Those words, written in 1549 and attributed to the English diplomat Sir Thomas Smith, are one of the earliest known expressions of what came to be called “mercantilism.” Update the language, and they could easily have been tweeted by U.S. President Donald Trump, the most prominent mercantilist of today. Trump believes—or at least says—that the United States “loses” when it runs trade deficits with other countries. Many Americans seem to agree."

Authoritarian governments are gaining power, and right-wing demagogues are gaining strength. Movements toward openness and pluralism have stalled. Inequality is growing, transforming rule by the people into rule by wealthy elites. And here in the United States, many Americans seem to accept—even embrace—the politics of division and resentment."
64,The Unhackable Election,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/united-states/unhackable-election,The Unhackable Election,"Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2014 marked a sharp break with the past: the post–Cold War interlude, a time when peace and democracy spread across the globe, was over, and a new, more aggressive era, had begun. Since then, Western governments have had to relearn the forgotten art of deterring attacks and protecting their countries’ borders. They have failed to see, however, that the attacks can also be aimed at their democratic institutions. Liberal democracy may remain the world’s preferred model of governance, but it is under debilitating pressure from threats both internal and external."

But the tough talk is misleading: there is little reason to think that Trump actually wants the United States to get more involved in the region."

67,How Congress Can Take Back Foreign Policy,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2018-11-07/how-congress-can-take-back-foreign-policy,How Congress Can Take Back Foreign Policy,"On January 3, 2019, U.S. President Donald Trump will face a new reality: a chamber of Congress controlled by the opposition party. Confronting a hostile Democratic House of Representatives will be a rude awakening for a president who chafes at any limits on his authority. For the first two years of his presidency, Trump experienced little resistance from the Republican-controlled Congress as he sought to disrupt the established international order. Republicans largely stood by as Trump withdrew from vital international agreements, embraced autocrats while giving allies the cold shoulder, used Twitter to threaten friends and foes alike, and discarded democracy and human rights as core values of U.S. foreign policy."

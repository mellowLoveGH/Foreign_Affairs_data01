0,A Hard Education,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/issue-packages/hard-education,What’s Inside,"After 13 years of war, the loss of many thousands of lives, and the expenditure of trillions of dollars, what has the United States learned? The answer depends on not only who is asking but when. The story of the Iraq war would have different endings, and morals, if told in 2003, 2006, 2011, or 2014, and it will continue to evolve. As for Afghanistan, the narrative there has also shifted over time, and the ending also remains in doubt. Neither disaster has been unmitigated. But few would argue that Washington’s approach to either has been a success worth emulating. So the most important question today is what can be learned from the failures."
1,The Mission for Manila,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/interviews/2014-10-20/mission-manila,The Mission for Manila,"In the last four years, Benigno Aquino III -- generally known by his nickname Noynoy -- has turned the Philippines from one of Asia’s underperformers into one of its economic stars. Aquino is a scion of the Philippines’ most beloved political dynasty; his father, the opposition leader Benigno Aquino, Jr., was assassinated by President Ferdinand Marcos in 1983, and his mother, Corazon Aquino, won the country’s first democratic election after the dictator’s fall. Thanks to an aggressive anticorruption campaign and sound, conservative macroeconomic policies, Aquino has racked up a long list of accomplishments since his 2010 election. In 2012 and 2013, the economy grew by 6.8 percent and 7.2 percent, respectively; inflation dropped; the stock market soared; and for the first time in its history, the country scored an investment-grade rating from the three main credit-rating agencies. This year, however, Aquino started to stumble, with corruption scandals and legal and political battles eroding his once-stratospheric approval rating. In late September, Aquino met with Foreign Affairs managing editor Jonathan Tepperman in New York to discuss the challenges he and his country face."
2,Opening Indonesia,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/interviews/2014-10-20/opening-indonesia,Opening Indonesia,"On July 9, nearly 135 million Indonesians went to some 480,000 polling stations and picked a new president -- just the third to be directly elected in the country’s history. (Indonesia overthrew its longtime dictator, Suharto, in 1998, but his initial successors were chosen by the legislature.) Their choice: Joko Widodo, known universally as Jokowi. A former small-town mayor from central Java, Jokowi first burst onto the national scene when he was elected governor of Jakarta in 2012. A populist and technocrat, Jokowi is neither rich nor wellborn; he dresses simply, is a self-professed metalhead with a special fondness for Metallica, and worked in the family furniture business before entering politics. His wild popularity and rapid ascent -- from provincial unknown to the leader of the world’s third-largest democracy -- have drawn comparisons to another president who spent part of his middle-class childhood in Indonesia: Barack Obama. But high expectations can be a curse as well as a blessing, and Jokowi faces huge challenges: endemic corruption, a once-promising economy that has gone into a tailspin, and a lingering threat of Islamic extremism. In mid-September, he met with Foreign Affairs managing editor Jonathan Tepperman at his Jakarta residence for his first interview with an English-language publication since his election."

9,The Golden Hour,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2014-10-17/golden-hour,The Golden Hour,"Judd Ryker, the daring hero of Moss’ novel, is a U.S. diplomat based in Mali who, over the course of 100 hours, must undo a coup, free a kidnapped Peace Corps volunteer, and stop an attack on the U.S. embassy. As the head of a crisis-response unit, Ryker faces down terrorists and -- almost as dangerous -- vicious bureaucratic infighting at the U.S. Department of State. In an author’s note, Moss, an economist who served briefly as a deputy assistant secretary of state in the Bureau of African Affairs, explains that his novel was partly inspired by the coup that took place in Mauritania in 2008, during his time in government. Although the novel suggests that Moss feels some animus toward the U.S. Foreign Service, professional diplomats will enjoy comparing his fictional portrayal with the reality they know. The novel provides little insight into how U.S. foreign policy has been made in recent years, nor does it illuminate the institutional issues that bedevil U.S. foreign policy. The Golden Hour mostly aims to entertain -- and in that, it succeeds."
10,Property and Political Order in Africa: Land Rights and the Structure of Politics,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2014-10-17/property-and-political-order-africa-land-rights-and-structure,Property and Political Order in Africa: Land Rights and the Structure of Politics,"Although little reliable information exists on the issue, experts widely believe that conflict over land is increasing in Africa, where property rights are often not firmly established and most arable land has not been recorded in authoritative registries. In her ambitious new book, Boone argues that struggles over land are now the defining characteristic of African politics and have an impact on all other political institutions and every interaction between citizens and states. In a dozen well-documented case studies from across the continent, she demonstrates how the powerful manipulate property rights for political purposes -- a phenomenon, Boone notes, that has been present since the colonial era. Why, then, do conflicts over land seem to be on the rise? Boone acknowledges the pressures created by explosive population growth and environmental deterioration but concludes that the main culprit is the democratization of the region during the last quarter of a century. The emergence of multiparty electoral competition, she claims, has created stronger incentives to manipulate land resources. One need not be convinced by that central thesis to be deeply impressed by this insightful book."

The country has been remarkably free of the ethnic strife that engulfed all its neighbors after independence. However, a variety of socialist experiments led to economic collapse in the 1970s, and the country continues to suffer from slower economic growth than those same neighbors. These two books analyze the seeming contradiction."
12,Whispering Truth to Power: Everyday Resistance to Reconciliation in Postgenocide Rwanda,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2014-10-17/whispering-truth-power-everyday-resistance-reconciliation,Whispering Truth to Power: Everyday Resistance to Reconciliation in Postgenocide Rwanda,"The Kagame regime in Rwanda continues to enjoy a solid reputation in the West, earning plaudits for its role in ending the 1994 genocide, promoting economic growth since then, and advocating national reconciliation. Thomson’s provocative study offers a useful corrective to that overly charitable conventional wisdom. Through extensive interviews with poor peasants in the southern Rwandan countryside, Thomson shows how Paul Kagame’s version of national reconciliation is designed not merely to forge a united Rwanda but also to control its citizens, shape the country’s history in a self-serving manner, and ensure Kagame’s hold on power. Thomson reveals that officials who carry out the government’s national-reconciliation policies often abuse their power to advance their own interests and, as a result, often enjoy little legitimacy. The book’s most novel sections describe the subtle and discrete but still subversive acts of passive resistance that poor Rwandans take to undermine government policies that disadvantage them. Thomson suggests the emergence of a kind of Rwandan class consciousness, as her respondents express a deep sense of alienation from elites whose policies they doubt will promote the broader welfare."
13,China’s Second Continent: How a Million Migrants Are Building a New Empire in Africa,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2014-10-17/chinas-second-continent-how-million-migrants-are-building-new,China’s Second Continent: How a Million Migrants Are Building a New Empire in Africa,"Over one million Chinese citizens have moved to Africa in the last two decades, where they have established a wide array of businesses, from small farms to large construction companies. In this perceptive account, backed by numerous and often insightful interviews with people in a dozen African countries, French makes clear that the Chinese presence in Africa is not solely the result of Chinese government policies. A surprising number of his subjects reveal that they left China because they found life in Africa more attractive and do not intend to return home. Although many of them rely on networks of fellow Chinese immigrants for capital and know-how, they often complain to the author about their countrymen, particularly those who hail from different parts of China. Still, French concedes that this substantial wave of emigration cannot be completely disassociated from China’s strategic and commercial ambitions in the region. Although French declines to render a simplistic positive or negative verdict on the effect of the Chinese presence on the region, he does argue that it expresses China’s quasi-imperial approach to promoting its global influence and power."
14,My Fight for a New Taiwan: One Woman’s Journey From Prison to Power,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2014-10-20/my-fight-new-taiwan-one-womans-journey-prison-power,My Fight for a New Taiwan: One Woman’s Journey From Prison to Power,"Today, the optimism and excitement stirred up by the wave of democratic transitions that swept the world in the 1980s and 1990s are hard to recall, much less rekindle. Many of the so-called Third Wave democracies have struggled to sustain the gains they made during those years, and more recent attempts to transform authoritarian states have ended in disappointment. That makes the new memoir by the democracy activist and feminist leader Lu (also known as Annette Lu), who was Taiwan’s vice president from 2000 to 2008, a welcome reminder of what is possible when political leaders -- government officials and antigovernment activists alike -- set aside their own interests and follow the will of the people they claim to serve. Lu’s story, which includes a stint in prison for political activity, emphasizes the compromises and sacrifices Taiwan’s democratic transition required from both sides. As an activist, Lu came to understand that attaining justice and democracy would mean collaborating with people who held goals quite different from hers, including nationalists and social conservatives. She portrays Taiwan’s democratization as the product of elites inside and outside the government responding to broad-based demands for freedom and accountability. Although the book includes some of the self-serving rhetoric one might expect to find in a political memoir, Lu’s engaging voice and extraordinary candor make it a surprising and inspiring read."
15,China 1945: Mao’s Revolution and America’s Fateful Choice,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2014-10-20/china-1945-maos-revolution-and-americas-fateful-choice,China 1945: Mao’s Revolution and America’s Fateful Choice,"In 1945, with World War II finally over, the United States was keen to find a compromise between the Chinese Nationalist leader Chiang Kai-shek and the head of the Chinese Communist Party, Mao Zedong, that would avoid more bloodshed in Asia. But even a U.S. negotiator as influential and effective as George Marshall could not reconcile the two sides. The ensuing civil war ended with Mao’s victory in 1949 and ignited a decades-long Cold War debate in Washington over who “lost” China. Bernstein argues convincingly that Mao’s party was always oriented toward anti-imperialist revolution and the Soviet Union and would never have been a partner of the United States. His narrative is elegant and compelling, drawing mainly on U.S. sources but also using some Chinese materials. The book brings to life characters such as the waspish U.S. Army general Joseph Stilwell and the eccentric U.S. ambassador Patrick Hurley. Bernstein also discusses with empathy how accusations of communist fellow-traveling ruined the careers of many U.S. Foreign Service officers and likely delayed the prospect of reengagement with China. This thoughtful book moves decisively beyond sterile old debates to demonstrate that in the end, China’s fate in 1945 was for the Chinese people, and not Americans, to decide."
16,The Bullet and the Ballot Box: The Story of Nepal’s Maoist Revolution,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2014-10-20/bullet-and-ballot-box-story-nepals-maoist-revolution,The Bullet and the Ballot Box: The Story of Nepal’s Maoist Revolution,"The Nepalese Maoist movement emerged at an unlikely time: the mid-1990s, when communism was in global retreat. But by 2006, the movement had gained control over most of Nepal’s countryside and had become the largest party in the country’s parliament. This thoroughly researched book reveals how this happened. The leaders were mostly educated youths from marginalized upper-caste families. As machinations rivaling those on the television show House of Cards roiled the palace and the parliament, the Maoists used hit-and-run tactics in poverty-stricken minority districts to provoke the king to unleash the army -- a move approved of by Washington. The regime’s harsh response generated additional support for the rebels. The Maoists made mistakes, but these were trumped by the king’s overreaching, which triggered an alliance between the rebels and the factions that finally drove the royal family from power in 2008. But in the aftermath of those events, the revolution has stalled. The government remains divided, the Maoists and the military have declined to cooperate with inquiries into the atrocities both sides committed, and a hard-line Maoist splinter group has accused the movement’s more mainstream leadership of opportunism for joining the parliamentary game."
17,“Good Coup” Gone Bad: Thailand’s Political Developments Since Thaksin’s Downfall,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2014-10-20/good-coup-gone-bad-thailands-political-developments-thaksins,“Good Coup” Gone Bad: Thailand’s Political Developments Since Thaksin’s Downfall,"According to the contributors to this volume, the Thai monarchy is not a rock of stability, as royalist orthodoxy would have it, but rather the root of Thailand’s troubles. These include frequent coups (including one that occurred earlier this year), a slow-growing rural economy, violent political polarization, a prolonged insurgency in the south, and a manufactured border crisis with Cambodia. The book focuses on the “yellow,” or royalist, camp, which consists of a network of elite interests backed by key military factions. Yellow politicians use an emotional “hyper-royalism” grounded in ancient Hindu and Buddhist beliefs, along with a draconian lese majesty law, to resist the challenge to their interests from the “red” movement, supported by politically aware peasants, the urban middle class, and urban workers. The authors give less attention to the corruption and human rights violations committed by politicians in this populist camp."
18,Patronage and Power: Local State Networks and Party-State Resilience in Rural China,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2014-10-20/patronage-and-power-local-state-networks-and-party-state,Patronage and Power: Local State Networks and Party-State Resilience in Rural China,"Hillman has deciphered “the unwritten rules of Chinese officialdom” over the course of ten years of fieldwork in southwestern China. Patronage lubricates the rigid gears of government so that bureaucrats and their friends can get things done. Upper levels of government shower grants, subsidies, and incentive payments on favored officials in townships and villages; local officials skim, bribe, and use favoritism to cultivate popular support. The results include land grabbing, pollution, and failed infrastructure projects, but also economic dynamism and the mostly peaceful resolution of local conflicts, since the losers in power struggles can always hope for a future spot at the trough. The area Hillman studied was poorer and more ethnically diverse than most parts of China, but his insights apply to local governments throughout the country and to higher levels of politics, as well. The practices he describes are so entrenched that even President Xi Jinping’s muscular anticorruption campaign might not uproot them. It is debatable whether they contribute to the resilience of the regime, as Hillman argues, or whether they serve to hollow out the state’s authority."
19,My Tibetan Childhood: When Ice Shattered Stone,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2014-10-20/my-tibetan-childhood-when-ice-shattered-stone,My Tibetan Childhood: When Ice Shattered Stone,"This unconventional memoir is a literary as well as historical treasure. Its spare style reflects the stoicism of an isolated nomadic community surviving on the Tibetan Plateau in the early 1950s. At age five, the narrator makes a 1,500-mile pilgrimage to Lhasa with his father and brother. Run-ins with wolves, bears, and bandits alternate with the benevolence of kindly strangers in dreamlike sequences that skirt the boundary between reality and myth. But things turn terribly real when the author, at age ten, flees with his clanmates before advancing Chinese troops, only to find himself in a prison consisting of holes in the ground, suffering through a famine. The story ends with the author and his brother in a Chinese-run school; he would later go on to serve as a local official in the Communist-led government. A lucid introduction by Robert Barnett (a colleague of mine at Columbia) shows how the author uses the “convention of childish innocence” to explore forbidden issues in Tibetan history, including the cruelty of the Chinese invasion but also that of the preinvasion Tibetan order."
20,By All Means Necessary: How China’s Resource Quest Is Changing the World,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2014-10-20/all-means-necessary-how-chinas-resource-quest-changing-world,By All Means Necessary: How China’s Resource Quest Is Changing the World,"Economy and Levi’s findings thread a path between alarmist and complacent views of China’s impact on the global economy. Chinese demand drives up world prices of oil and copper, but not those of natural gas and bauxite, owing to differences in the market structures surrounding each commodity. Some Chinese companies buy foreign mines and farmland to carry out state strategy, but others consist of private entrepreneurs pursuing commercial interests. Chinese firms might bring pollution and corrupt business practices when they invest abroad, but their behavior depends on the regulatory frameworks of their host countries. China will try to protect its overseas assets and sea-lanes, but with a lighter military hand than the United States uses. Ironically, China pays a bigger reputational cost than other big countries for its firms’ bad practices abroad, so Beijing pushes its enterprises harder to adhere to high standards than do Western governments, although with mixed results. The authors present these nuanced views with exemplary clarity and leave the impression that Washington’s policies toward Beijing do not require fundamental change."
21,The Taliban Revival: Violence and Extremism on the Pakistan-Afghanistan Frontier,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2014-10-20/taliban-revival-violence-and-extremism-pakistan-afghanistan,The Taliban Revival: Violence and Extremism on the Pakistan-Afghanistan Frontier,"Abbas is a Pakistani academic based in the United States who previously worked as a police officer in Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province and Federally Administered Tribal Areas. His books seeks to answer a basic question: Why did the Afghan Taliban rebound after U.S.-led forces defeated them in 2001–2? His answers spare none of the region’s main players: there is plenty of blame to go around. Abbas’ clear and convincing analysis also shows how the Afghan Taliban differ from Taliban groups based in Pakistan and how all those groups fit into the not-so-Great Game played by India, Pakistan, Iran, and Saudi Arabia. Still, although the book is thoughtful and well written, it offers little new information. Abbas concludes with a number of recommendations for how Afghanistan can avoid sliding back into chaos: strengthen the criminal justice system, find ways to generate more revenue for the central government, engage extremists in dialogue, decentralize authority, and promote religious harmony."
22,The Good Spy: The Life and Death of Robert Ames,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2014-10-20/good-spy-life-and-death-robert-ames,The Good Spy: The Life and Death of Robert Ames,"Robert Ames was an influential CIA operative in the Middle East who was killed in the blast that leveled the U.S. embassy in Beirut in April 1983, which Washington has blamed on Hezbollah and Iran. Bird argues that for more than a decade, Ames was the sole U.S. conduit to Yasir Arafat and the Palestine Liberation Organization. Ames’ main connection to Arafat was Ali Hassan Salameh, a flamboyant Palestinian who was close to the PLO leader -- and whom the Mossad, the Israeli intelligence agency, assassinated in 1979. The friction such actions led to between the cia and the Mossad emerge as a constant theme in the book. Bird also tells the lesser-known tale of how U.S. intelligence came close to abandoning the Hashemite monarchy of Jordan in 1970 after King Hussein drove the PLO from his country and into Lebanon, with terrible consequences. Bird narrates the bombing that killed Ames in gut-wrenching detail. Ames left behind six children and a widow and did not live to see Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin shake hands on the White House lawn -- nor to witness the slow-motion collapse of the dream of peace between Israel and the Palestinians, in which Ames deeply believed."
23,Turkey and the Arab Spring: Leadership in the Middle East,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2014-10-20/turkey-and-arab-spring-leadership-middle-east,Turkey and the Arab Spring: Leadership in the Middle East,"Despite his years as a Middle East analyst for the CIA, the National Intelligence Council, and the RAND Corporation, Fuller is a fierce critic of U.S. policy in the region. He spreads the blame for the Middle East’s woes among Western powers and local actors -- especially Saudi Arabia, whose regime he believes will not survive much longer. Fuller’s portrait of the present state of the region is at odds with most conventional accounts. In his view, the great contemporary battle is neither the conflict between Shiites and Sunnis nor the one between Iran and Saudi Arabia, but rather a tug of war over Sunni identity that pits Turkey and its moderate Islamist Justice and Development Party (AKP) against Saudi Arabia and the extremist Salafi vassals it funds. Fuller backs the AKP (as well as the Muslim Brotherhood more generally) and seems confident that the AKP embodies a truly democratic brand of political Islam. This sweeping survey is marred by a number of oddities (such as an apologia for the idea of a reinvented caliphate) and inconsistencies (for example, Fuller minimizes the role of sectarianism in regional politics while also insisting on the centrality of the struggle to define Sunni identity)."
24,Water on Sand: Environmental Histories of the Middle East and North Africa,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2014-10-20/water-sand-environmental-histories-middle-east-and-north-africa,Water on Sand: Environmental Histories of the Middle East and North Africa,"Environmental history is a fascinating field, but this volume lacks a binding thread. Despite its fractured focus, much of the material the collection presents is interesting, and its range is impressive, from considerations of the environment’s effect on the longevity of empires to estimates of the size of the typical daily catch enjoyed by fishermen in medieval Istanbul. In his chapter, J. R. McNeill explores the differing power bases relied on by agrarian and pastoral empires. Richard Bulliet shows how during the Middle Ages, population growth spurred the development of wind and water power for milling in Europe, while in the Middle East, cheap communal grazing favored the use of animals. Sam White speculates on the degree to which the Little Ice Age weakened the Ottoman Empire. Other contributions explore the incidence of plague in Egypt, the role water and oil played in building the power base of the Saudi monarchy, France’s establishment of national parks in its colonies, environmental policymaking in Lebanon, and land reclamation in Egypt. Before reading on such topics, however, it is wise to keep in mind a caveat McNeill issues: “Much of the foregoing is speculation that cannot be tested or verified.”"
25,A Time to Attack: The Looming Iranian Nuclear Threat,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2014-10-20/time-attack-looming-iranian-nuclear-threat,A Time to Attack: The Looming Iranian Nuclear Threat,"Kroenig advances a serious, but not entirely convincing, argument in favor of a U.S. strike on Iran’s nuclear facilities. The case rests on one premise in particular: the United States has the military capability to destroy all known Iranian nuclear facilities without committing any ground troops to the task. If that premise is incorrect, the rest of Kroenig’s brief crumbles. Kroenig proposes that if Iran dismisses inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency and begins to enrich uranium to a level of 90 percent purity, Washington should introduce a UN Security Council resolution in favor of a military strike -- but should prepare and expect to act alone. He contends that a successful U.S. strike would halt Iran’s nuclear program for at least five years. Kroenig makes his case without tub-thumping or demonization, but his position is weakened by the fact that he sees a nuclear-armed Iran as a uniquely dangerous goad to proliferation in the Middle East without seeming to realize that Israel, which has had nuclear weapons for decades, also fits that bill."

Klehr and Haynes have taken a massive original Russian text by Firsov, a Russian archivist, and boiled it down into a well-synthesized volume. So well do the authors compress, integrate, and discuss the material that the text has the flow of a full-blown history. Although the international communist movement’s abject servility to Joseph Stalin has been well documented, it is still stunning to read about the contortions that communists all over the world undertook to placate the Soviet leader: first resisting the rise of fascism, then applauding Stalin’s 1939 deal with Adolf Hitler, then explaining away Stalin’s purges, and ultimately swallowing even the expedient abolition of the Comintern itself during World War II. The documents reveal an interesting form of consistency: the language and ideas conveyed in these secret communications closely parallel those of the public speeches and propaganda broadsides of the Soviet regime."

But few, if any, explore the relationship between the two subjects. This one does so by looking at how nationalist excesses undo the rule of law -- and how the rule of law, when properly defended, can tame nationalism. Rangelov takes “ethnic citizenship,” the state’s privileging of one ethnic group over others, as his point of departure. He examines how a government’s attempts to engineer ethnic citizenship can undermine the rule of law, using the case of Slovenia in the early 1990s as evidence. Then, he shows how confronting wartime crimes and struggling with transitional justice after a conflict can help a country come to terms with the dark side of nationalism; Croatia after 1999 serves as an example. Finally, Rangelov explores the evolution of international criminal justice, whose focus has shifted from “crimes against peace” to “crimes against humanity.” Here, he zeroes in on the case of Serbia during and after the Balkan wars of the 1990s, where the attempt to enforce this new international norm has produced both justice and strident local opposition."
28,Pick Your Battles,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2014-10-20/pick-your-battles,Pick Your Battles,"For more than a decade now, U.S. soldiers have been laboring under a sad paradox: even though the United States enjoys unprecedented global military dominance that should cow enemies mightily, it has found itself in constant combat for longer than ever before in its history, and without much to show for it. Of the U.S. military actions in Kosovo, Afghanistan, Iraq, and Libya, only the first can be counted a success."
29,Withdrawal Symptoms,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/withdrawal-symptoms,Withdrawal Symptoms,"In a speech at Fort Bragg on December 14, 2011, President Barack Obama declared that the U.S. military would soon depart Iraq, ending one of the longest wars in American history. The United States, Obama said, would leave behind “a sovereign, stable, and self-reliant Iraq, with a representative government that was elected by its people.” Four days later, the last U.S. military unit crossed from Iraq into Kuwait, and American armed forces transferred all their responsibilities to either the central government of Iraq, U.S. Central Command, or the U.S. embassy in Baghdad, completing the most complex handoff from military to civilian authorities in U.S. history."
30,The Unraveling,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2014-10-20/unraveling,The Unraveling,"In his classic The Anarchical Society, the scholar Hedley Bull argued that there was a perennial tension in the world between forces of order and forces of disorder, with the details of the balance between them defining each era’s particular character. Sources of order include actors committed to existing international rules and arrangements and to a process for modifying them; sources of disorder include actors who reject those rules and arrangements in principle and feel free to ignore or undermine them. The balance can also be affected by global trends, to varying degrees beyond the control of governments, that create the context for actors’ choices. These days, the balance between order and disorder is shifting toward the latter. Some of the reasons are structural, but some are the result of bad choices made by important players -- and at least some of those can and should be corrected."

32,The End of the Military-Industrial Complex,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/end-military-industrial-complex,The End of the Military-Industrial Complex,"In late 2013, Google announced that it had acquired Boston Dynamics, an engineering and robotics company best known for creating BigDog, a four-legged robot that can accompany soldiers into rough terrain. Much of the resulting hype focused on the Internet giant and when it might start making various types of robots. What was good news for Google, however, represented a major loss for the U.S. Department of Defense. Although Google agreed to honor Boston Dynamics’ existing defense commitments, including its contracts with the U.S. Army, the U.S. Navy, and the U.S. Marine Corps, the company indicated that it might not pursue any additional work for the military. In practice, this means that the Department of Defense could lose its edge in the emerging field of autonomous robotics, which once fell almost exclusively under its domain."
33,Misrule of the Few,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/greece/misrule-few,Misrule of the Few,"Just a few years ago, Greece came perilously close to defaulting on its debts and exiting the eurozone. Today, thanks to the largest sovereign bailout in history, the country’s economy is showing new signs of life. In exchange for promises that Athens would enact aggressive austerity measures, the so-called troika -- the European Central Bank, the European Commission, and the International Monetary Fund -- provided tens of billions of dollars in emergency loans. From the perspective of many global investors and European officials, those policies have paid off. Excluding a one-off expenditure to recapitalize its banks, Greece’s budget shortfall totaled roughly two percent last year, down from nearly 16 percent in 2009. Last year, the country ran a current account surplus for the first time in over three decades. And this past April, Greece returned to the international debt markets it had been locked out of for four years, issuing $4 billion in five-year government bonds at a relatively low yield -- only 4.95 percent. (Demand exceeded $26 billion.) In August, Moody’s Investors Service upgraded the country’s credit rating by two notches."

It is a patriotic call to arms, drawing inspiration from the glories of China’s imperial past and the ideals of its socialist present to promote political unity at home and influence abroad. After just two years in office, Xi has advanced himself as a transformative leader, adopting an agenda that proposes to reform, if not revolutionize, political and economic relations not only within China but also with the rest of the world."
35,The Strategic Logic of Trade,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/americas/2014-11-13/strategic-logic-trade,The Strategic Logic of Trade,"For much of the twentieth century, leaders and policymakers around the world viewed the strategic importance of trade, and of international economic policy more generally, largely through the lens of military strength. They believed that the role of a strong economy was to act as an enabler, supporting a strong military, which they saw as the best way to project power and influence. But in recent decades, leaders have come to see the economic clout that trade produces as more than merely a purse for military prowess: they now understand prosperity to be a principal means by which countries measure and exercise power."
36,Promises to Keep,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/africa/promises-keep,Promises to Keep,"The United Nations has always had lots of targets, goals, and declarations. You probably didn’t know, for example, that 2014 is the International Year of Family Farming and the International Year of Crystallography -- or that you are currently living through the Decade of Action for Road Safety. Such initiatives often reflect good intentions but rarely prove consequential. Between 1950 and 2000, at least 12 UN resolutions called for some form of universal education. In 1961, the so-called Addis Ababa Plan pledged that primary schooling in Africa would be “universal, compulsory and free” within two decades. Twenty years later, nearly half of all African children were still out of school. Countless other efforts promised equally lofty achievements, from gender equality to world peace, that never materialized."

40,Bitcoin and Stability,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/bitcoin-and-stability,Bitcoin and Stability,"Benn Steil (“Taper Trouble,” July/August 2014) makes an all-too-common error in dismissing the role of Bitcoin in world monetary affairs: equating the currency with one service provider. The collapse of Mt. Gox, a large Bitcoin exchange based in Japan, did roil the Bitcoin world. Mt. Gox tried to blame its downfall on the Bitcoin protocol, but it was actually the exchange’s inattention to the protocol that caused its problems. If a large U.S. bank collapsed as a result of poor accounting and bad cash management, few would see cause to argue against the U.S. dollar; likewise, assessments of Bitcoin’s role in monetary affairs should be based not on Mt. Gox but on the protocol itself."

Leading nearly 200 journalists through the exhibition, Francesco Rutelli, Italy’s then cultural minister, proclaimed, “The odyssey of these objects, which started with their brutal removal from the bowels of the earth, didn’t end on the shelf of some American museum. With nostalgia, they have returned. These beautiful pieces have reconquered their souls.” Rutelli was not just anthropomorphizing ancient artifacts by giving them souls. By insisting that they were the property of Italy and important to its national identity, he was also giving them citizenship."

Her task, however, goes beyond merely justifying the label as a fair characterization of the murder of thousands of Bosnian Muslims during that conflict. She probes deeply into the nature of the killings, focusing as much on the intent to commit genocide as on the various methods of carrying it out. She argues that destroying a people first requires dehumanizing them; in this case, the Serbs relied in part on historical myths and popular biases against the Bosniaks. But transforming ordinary people into murderers, Becirevic contends, also requires calculating leadership and the intensive use of propaganda. Ultimately, her attention turns to those present at the time of the killings -- and others, much farther away -- who averted their eyes at the time or later denied the truth of the episode. Such denial, she warns, contains the seeds of future tragedy."

Khodorkovsky’s story -- his corrupt path to wealth, which surpassed that of all other Russians; his 2003 arrest; the rigged trials that brought him down; his imprisonment; and his release last year -- has been examined many times from many angles. Sakwa, however, draws all the tale’s strands together in unmatched detail. He also explores Khodorkovsky’s philosophical development during the time he spent in prison, where the former tycoon reflected on and wrote about the concept of freedom and the relationship between state power and social justice; a full third of the book examines Khodorkovsky as a social critic and political theorist. Sakwa also uses the story of Khodorkovsky’s spectacular rise and fall as a lever, helping him pry open the inner workings of the Russian political system."

A month earlier, the two leaders had concluded a pact promising not to interfere in each other’s aggressive military campaigns and devised a secret plan to divvy up the lands between their countries. Moorhouse captures the essence of the wretched deal better than anyone has before. As they ripped Europe apart, Berlin and Moscow danced an awkward ballet, straining to preserve their compact while mutual mistrust mounted and their armies deported large segments of the local populations in captured territories. Moorhouse concludes by tracing with new detail the stages by which Hitler ultimately decided to invade the Soviet Union and, on the other side, Stalin’s bewildered efforts to both deny and prepare for the double-cross."

The baron of the title is Roman von Ungern-Sternberg. He was born in 1885 in Graz, in the Austro-Hungarian Empire, to an aristocratic Baltic German father, and was raised in what is now Estonia. He received military training in St. Petersburg and went on to make a career as an officer in the tsar’s army, stationed mostly on Russia’s border with Mongolia. Ungern-Sternberg’s life spanned great events: the intense Russification of the tsar’s sprawling empire in the late nineteenth century, the rising revolutionary tide of 1905, World War I, the 1917 Russian Revolution, and the subsequent civil war. After the Bolsheviks took power, Ungern-Sternberg attempted to establish an independent state in Mongolia -- a monarchy that he himself would rule. In 1921, that dream was crushed by the Red Army, which captured and executed the baron. Sunderland does a remarkable job of blending Ungern-Sternberg’s life story with an exquisite portrait of the far-flung reaches of the Russian empire, producing an utterly absorbing tale of one man encountering historic change in almost incomprehensibly complex surroundings."

In the late 1990s, the Zetas emerged from elite military units determined to get a piece of the action in the burgeoning drug-trafficking business. Grayson attributes the Zetas’ startling success to various techniques, including creating a brand based on extreme violence, which intimidates rivals and victims but also facilitates recruitment and personnel retention; diversifying the group’s business activities beyond drug trafficking to include extortion, petroleum theft, and the illicit sale of organs; entering into pragmatic, ad hoc alliances with other gangs and corrupt law enforcement units; employing attractive women known as panteras (panthers) to seduce or kill opponents; and, most alarming, penetrating the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the Border Patrol. To better counter the Zetas, Grayson advocates the increased use of intelligence-collecting drones; tougher anti-money-laundering measures; more training for Mexicans by non-U.S. security forces, such as Spain’s Guardia Civil; and grass-roots community-based programs to prevent at-risk youths from falling under the sway of traffickers."
49,Rivalry and Alliance Politics in Cold War Latin America,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2014-10-20/rivalry-and-alliance-politics-cold-war-latin-america,Rivalry and Alliance Politics in Cold War Latin America,"As Darnton notes, parochial bureaucratic interests -- particularly within security forces that rely on perceptions of enduring external threats to justify their influence and incomes -- can act as major obstacles to reconciliation between rival states. What, then, explains the rapprochements between traditional pairs of rivals such as Argentina and Brazil, Argentina and Chile, or Honduras and Nicaragua? Darnton identifies two conditions that have made such détentes possible: the emergence of alternative threats such as domestic insurgencies and tight budget constraints that compel security forces to forgo preparations for external wars in favor of counterinsurgency at home. Darnton does not overstate his case and recognizes that there are other paths to peace. Darnton warns U.S. policymakers that too much foreign assistance to security forces might inadvertently delay reconciliation between two rivals that are both U.S. allies by removing budget constraints that would otherwise encourage pragmatism. Political scientists will appreciate Darnton’s well-aimed jibes at the major schools of international relations theory, and Latin America specialists will welcome his deft applications of cutting-edge theories to a region long underrepresented in political science scholarship."

In its formative years, the austere Cuban Revolution repressed homosexuality. Today, figures as influential as President Raúl Castro’s daughter Mariela push for equal rights for LGBT Cubans. Cuba’s LGBT community seeks to disassociate itself from those who service sexual tourism, but Stout meets gay Cubans in loving relationships with foreigners that nonetheless seem to blur the line between transactional and authentic intimacy. More generally, Cubans are embracing new opportunities for private business even as they regret the sacrifice of socialist solidarity. In this newly fluid environment, Stout explores multilayered subcultures and shifting gender roles as they interact with ethnicity, class, and the emergence of consumer lifestyles: a desire for designer clothes, rather than the deprivations of abject poverty, drives some of the sex workers she profiles."
51,Back Channel to Cuba; Economic Normalization With Cuba,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2014-10-20/back-channel-cuba-economic-normalization-cuba,Back Channel to Cuba; Economic Normalization With Cuba,"LeoGrande and Kornbluh’s exhaustive and masterful diplomatic history will stand as the most authoritative account of U.S.-Cuban diplomatic relations during the five decades of Cuban President Fidel Castro’s rule -- at least until scholars gain better access to Cuban archives and officials. Skillfully interpreting reams of declassified memorandums, unpublished memoirs, and in-depth interviews with key U.S. players, LeoGrande and Kornbluh uncover the intriguing secret dialogues that 11 American presidential administrations conducted with Castro’s shrewd emissaries and sometimes with Castro himself. The authors focus on the central question of why so many attempts by so many seasoned diplomats repeatedly collapsed, sometimes after promising beginnings. LeoGrande and Kornbluh highlight a number of factors. On the Cuban side, they note Cuba’s insistence that the United States lift its economic embargo at the outset of any talks (which would eliminate a key source of U.S. leverage); Cuba’s refusal during the Cold War to compromise on its policy of international solidarity with leftist allies and the Soviet Union; and, perhaps, Castro’s reliance on an acrimonious relationship with the United States to cement his domestic rule. On the U.S. side, the book reveals the American tendency to fumble the sequencing of quid pro quo offers; the way that, within every presidential administration, tenacious Cuba policy hawks sabotaged doves; the disruptive effects of U.S. domestic politics; and, perhaps most important, Washington’s utter refusal to recognize Cuban autonomy. Facing so many potential veto points, back-channel diplomacy was bound to fail."
52,The Greenest Nation? A New History of German Environmentalism,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2014-10-20/greenest-nation-new-history-german-environmentalism,The Greenest Nation? A New History of German Environmentalism,"Today, Germany is the “greenest” of the world’s major economies, far ahead of the United States when it comes to environmental policy. Uekötter, who belongs to a new generation of environmental historians, explores why Germany -- a crowded nation of industrial exporters -- has produced one of the world’s most advanced approaches to environmental protection. The conventional view holds that Germans have been rich for long enough to develop (and afford) “postmaterialist” values and had, for a time, a strong and chic Green Party that surfed a global wave of environmentalism. Some of Uekötter’s evidence points in that direction. But his account demonstrates that even as the German Green Party faded, Germany continued to implement and maintain important environmental policies through fiscal and regulatory means, suggesting that the party and its historical moment has had a lasting impact on mainstream German politics."

Most of the attention has been focused on its causes and on participants’ memories of life in the trenches. Yet that kind of remembrance overlooks the question that is perhaps most puzzling to contemporary sensibilities: If, as most analysts believe, this horrific war was unintended, then why did it last so long? What explains the four years of remarkably persistent commitment to the war effort by all parties -- but particularly by Germany, which was surrounded by enemies and where between 80 and 90 percent of adult males under 50 served in the military? Watson’s original and often riveting book traces the subtle interplay of propaganda, hardship, and martial enthusiasm that strengthened the resolve of publics in Central Europe. It goes on to trace the ruthless economic exploitation of eastern Europe by Austria and Germany and the suffering caused by the equally brutal economic blockade imposed by the war’s eventual winners on its eventual losers, both of which help explain why public support for the war waned. Yet the destructive legacy of this experience also illuminates the socially, politically, and economically polarized politics of the interwar period, which led to the rise of extremism and the outbreak of World War II."

It reflects the virtues of The Economist, where both authors work: the analysis is well informed, concise, sober, and backed by pertinent data. It also shares the vices of magazine writing, notably an episodic approach to presentation and an overemphasis on the current conventional wisdom. Peet and La Guardia argue that although establishing the euro was a mistake based on over-optimistic beliefs about future economic convergence and institutional development, muddling through remains the only viable alternative. Yet when it comes to how, exactly, to do that, they seem as perplexed as today’s European leaders."
56,The American Vice Presidency: From Irrelevance to Power,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2014-10-20/american-vice-presidency-irrelevance-power,The American Vice Presidency: From Irrelevance to Power,"The transformation of the vice-presidency in the last generation represents the most striking contemporary innovation in U.S. governance. The vice president of the United States has become a kind of assistant president, often enjoying greater influence than any member of the executive branch save the president. Readers hoping that this book (by one of the country’s most distinguished journalists and political commentators) will explain this transformation will be disappointed. Instead, Witcover has produced a series of capsule biographies of each person who has held the office, from John Adams to Joe Biden. The short biographies lack the depth of reflection and intensity of analysis that might have turned the book into something more than a superficial chronicle. One hopes that another writer will step forward to show how the rise of the modern vice-presidency -- which began, as Witcover rightly notes, with Walter Mondale -- illustrates the changing nature of executive power in the contemporary United States."
57,Founders’ Son: A Life of Abraham Lincoln,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2014-10-20/founders-son-life-abraham-lincoln,Founders’ Son: A Life of Abraham Lincoln,"When Abraham Lincoln was born, in 1809, Thomas Jefferson was still president and the revolutionary generation of 1776 was still firmly in command of the country. As Lincoln reached maturity, the founding generation slowly died off, and American political culture had to adjust to its absence. As Lincoln built his career and developed his political philosophy, the nature of the founders’ legacy remained a contentious issue. In this elegantly written book, Brookhiser reveals Lincoln’s role in that debate and offers new insights into Lincoln’s inner life and political thinking. Founders’ Son reminds readers that the Civil War was a struggle over the meaning of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution; Southern secessionists based their positions on a particular interpretation of what the founders meant to say in those documents. It fell to Lincoln, more than to anyone else, to combat those ideas. Brookhiser’s argument that Lincoln’s reading of the Declaration of Independence serves as the foundation of contemporary American political ideology is hardly original, but the biographical and cultural context in which Brookhiser sets the observation makes it feel fresh."

Conventional treatments of the American Revolution, for example, usually give short shrift to the economics and politics of Great Britain. Bunker’s tightly argued and deeply researched book shows how a broader perspective can shed new light on even the most familiar events. Bunker puts the conflict between the colonists and the crown into perspective, demonstrating how it was just one part of a broader crisis in the evolving global economy. The British Empire was developing too rapidly for London’s ramshackle institutions to manage or control. At the same time, British politicians largely failed to understand the dynamics of the rapidly modernizing global economy centered in London. The American revolutionaries thought they faced an efficient and tyrannical regime; in reality, overworked and underresourced British colonial administrators were so poorly informed and so badly organized that they were unable to understand, much less control, the rapid developments taking place on the other side of the Atlantic."
59,The New Class Conflict,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2014-10-20/new-class-conflict,The New Class Conflict,"This original and provocative book should stimulate fresh thinking -- and produce vigorous dissent. In essence, Kotkin argues that an alliance between superwealthy elites in Silicon Valley and on Wall Street and what he calls the “clerisy” of upper-middle-class professionals is driving the American middle class proper to the brink. The middle class, Kotkin argues, depends on things such as cheap energy, heavy industry, land-use rules that favor single-family housing, regional-planning policies that reduce the cost of homeownership, and more effective border control to protect lower-skilled workers from wage competition. Those policies are anathema to climate change activists, conservationists, and “new urbanists” (who see a revival of dense urban cores as good social and environmental policy). Kotkin foresees bitter political conflict between populists and environmentalists, and if The New Class Conflict is even partly right, interesting times lie ahead. Populism has always been one of the driving forces in U.S. politics, but as Kotkin reminds us, neither the liberal left nor the Tea Party right fully captures populist aspirations."

So he was thrilled when local authorities decided to allow the band to march in that year’s Christmas parade through town. But pride turned to chagrin when the band discovered that it would come last in the parade, separated from the white high school’s band and positioned directly behind a contingent of horses -- ridden by whites, of course. “A two and a half mile march through the muck and the other stuff left by the horses,” is how Clyburn describes what followed. Jim Crow died hard in Sumter, yet Clyburn became the first black man elected to represent South Carolina in the House of Representatives since Reconstruction and went on to serve as majority whip, one of the highest congressional positions ever held by an African American. To read his remarkable, engaging memoir is to be reminded of the stunning accomplishments of the generation of African Americans who broke Jim Crow and brought the United States (and especially Clyburn’s beloved South) into a new and brighter era. The civil rights movement did not emerge from a vacuum; it was formed by idealistic and hard-working entrepreneurs, preachers, and community leaders living in a segregated and unequal society who refused to lose hope. Clyburn’s memoir is more than the account of one man’s life: it is a portrait of the South in a time of historic change."

E. Lawrence famously described guerrilla warfare as akin to “eating soup with a knife.” Nagl, a retired lieutenant colonel in the U.S. Army, chose that expression as the title for an earlier book on how armies conduct counterinsurgency; the title of this memoir alludes to it as well. In 2004, as an operations officer in a tank battalion in Iraq, Nagl witnessed U.S. forces commit critical errors. Later, he became familiar in defense and media circles as a scholar-soldier -- a leading light among the “COINdinistas,” the group of academics and officers associated with U.S. General David Petraeus, who pushed hard for and then implemented a new approach to counterinsurgency, or COIN, in Iraq. This engaging book exhibits droll humor and a sharp grasp of the limits and possibilities of the U.S. Army as a learning organization."

It is the autobiography of a delinquent young Danish man, Storm, who gave up on a boxing career and turned to Islam to give his life some meaning. His views became progressively more militant, and he was drawn into jihadist groups, both close to home (in the United Kingdom) and farther afield (in Yemen). His reminiscences convey the cultish and criminal aspects of life on the jihadist fringe. Over time, theological doubts, as well as a growing distaste for indiscriminate violence, led Storm to a rather abrupt disillusion with jihadism. He knew he was on the radar of Danish intelligence and ultimately offered his services as a double agent, a role he performed effectively. His tale illuminates the methods that intelligence agencies (including MI6 and the CIA) use to keep track of terrorists and how terrorists seek to evade them. Storm fell out with British intelligence, which would not get involved in assassinations, and later parted ways with the CIA, which he claims declined to give him the reward he felt was due for his role in the assassination of the militant imam Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen who was targeted by a 2011 U.S. drone strike in Yemen."

Shore is skeptical of models that assume that actors will behave rationally. Instead, he looks to cognitive psychology and explores the idea of empathy as an aid to decision-making in a crisis. He uses a number of examples to show how leaders able to get into the minds of their opponents (think of Mahatma Gandhi facing the British) do better than those who cannot (think of Stalin missing signs of Hitler’s aggressive intentions). Shore’s less familiar examples of canny mind readers include Gustav Stresemann, the German chancellor during the Weimar era, who managed to acquire weapons from the Soviets in violation of the Treaty of Versailles without falling out with France and the United Kingdom. Shore’s case studies are rich and well written, but with so many factors at play in any given crisis, including luck and timing, it is hard to demonstrate that one human quality can improve the chances of a good result -- or even that what passes for empathy will always yield true insight."
65,Beautiful Game Theory: How Soccer Can Help Economics,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2014-10-20/beautiful-game-theory-how-soccer-can-help-economics,Beautiful Game Theory: How Soccer Can Help Economics,"Soccer -- or football, in most of the world -- is universally popular, especially in years when the World Cup takes place. The sport is also notable for another reason: it has produced a gold mine of data. Detailed records of professional-league games go back many years and cover many countries. Palacios-Huerta draws on that copious archive of information to illuminate and formally test a number of propositions in economics, including the “minimax” strategy devised by game theorists and the efficient-market hypothesis proposed by finance theorists; both concepts pass empirical muster, according to Palacios-Huerta’s analysis. The book also examines the impact on soccer matches of economic incentives, social pressure, racial discrimination, and the fear of hooliganism, which sometimes emerges among the crowds at soccer games. Parts of the book are written mainly for economists, and numbers abound. But lay readers can skim or even skip those parts; the rest of the book is enjoyably accessible to nonspecialists, especially sports enthusiasts, who will learn a great deal about soccer, economics, and human behavior more generally."
66,Production in the Innovation Economy; The Second Machine Age,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2014-10-20/production-innovation-economy-second-machine-age,Production in the Innovation Economy; The Second Machine Age,"Both these books feature ideas about the future of innovation from researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Locke and Wellhausen’s volume, based on research for MIT’s Production in the Innovation Economy Commission, offers a sober, cautiously optimistic assessment and foresees the coming of some promising, perhaps even transformational, innovations in manufacturing technology in the coming decades. The contributors stress the fact that in order to have a significant positive effect on the U.S. economy, research and development on manufacturing must be paired with a healthy manufacturing sector. The book also notes that although there is no great mismatch between the skills possessed by the U.S. labor force and the skills required by the U.S. economy, the American educational system could still do a better job of preparing students for the kinds of jobs they are likely to seek."
67,Why We Need Nuclear Power: The Environmental Case,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2014-10-20/why-we-need-nuclear-power-environmental-case,Why We Need Nuclear Power: The Environmental Case,"Fox might seem an unlikely advocate for nuclear power: he is a biologist who studies the effects of radiation on living things. But he also takes the threat of climate change seriously and believes that the world must reduce its dependence on coal, in part by building many more nuclear power plants. Nuclear energy, he argues, can provide plentiful electric power at a reasonable cost in a way that most renewable sources of energy cannot. The book’s discussions of complex scientific issues, including a useful explanation of the influence of radiation on human health, should be accessible to anyone who recalls high school physics. Fox’s forceful case for more nuclear power sensibly addresses the dangers, health issues, fuel supply, waste disposal, and potential costs involved; this book deserves to find an audience not only in North America but also in Europe and Japan."
68,Consumption in China: How China’s New Consumer Ideology Is Shaping the Nation,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2014-10-20/consumption-china-how-chinas-new-consumer-ideology-shaping-nation,Consumption in China: How China’s New Consumer Ideology Is Shaping the Nation,"Economists often remark on China’s high savings rate. But if incomes are growing rapidly, as they are in China, high savings do not imply low consumption. With an anthropologist’s eye and training, Yu examines how the consumption habits of young urban Chinese have changed during the past two decades and how consumption both reflects and helps define individuality in China. A century ago, the economist Thorstein Veblen coined the term “conspicuous consumption” to characterize the materialism of newly well-to-do Americans. Yu prefers the term “conspicuous accomplishment” for China’s young nouveaux riches, who typically work hard and want to establish their social status not only through what they wear but also through what they do. Wealthy young Chinese tend to purchase luxury goods abroad, where they can find reliably authentic wares at lower prices. Such high-end acquisitions typically take place at a much younger age in China than in the West, since many wealthy young Chinese are unmarried and have no siblings (thanks to China’s one-child policy); many still live with their frugal parents and thus have little else on which to spend their money."
69,In 100 Years: Leading Economists Predict the Future,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2014-10-20/100-years-leading-economists-predict-future,In 100 Years: Leading Economists Predict the Future,"In 1930, John Maynard Keynes gave a famous lecture in which he took an uncharacteristic stab at forecasting the distant future, 100 years away. He predicted that by 2030, “progressive countries,” such as the United Kingdom and the United States, would have standards of living four to eight times as high as they did then. Palacios-Huerta saw fit to repeat this thought experiment and invited ten prominent economists to participate, each one independently imagining economic life circa 2114. The results make for stimulating reading. Some common predictions emerge: technology will continue to improve, poverty and population growth will both diminish, most relatively poor countries will continue to catch up with the rich world, the risks from climate change will grow more severe, and unforeseen epidemics may spread. Many of the contributors emphasize the vital role of good governance in producing positive economic outcomes -- an unsurprising but important point given the serious decision-making problems that currently plague Washington and European capitals. Some contributors also stress the crucial role that political rights and individual freedoms play in spurring innovation and contend that as such rights continue to expand around the world -- at an uneven pace and with some reversals, to be sure -- innovation is likely to accelerate."
70,The Empire of Civilization: The Evolution of an Imperial Idea,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2014-10-20/empire-civilization-evolution-imperial-idea,The Empire of Civilization: The Evolution of an Imperial Idea,"The idea of civilization is often seen as old-fashioned, invoked by Europeans in the nineteenth century to explain Western dominance and justify “civilizing” acts of empire. But in this 2009 book, recently reissued in paperback, Bowden argues that the idea of civilization still lurks in the interventionist worldviews of many Western thinkers and leaders. This fascinating book traces the concept to the Enlightenment, when it evolved along with Western visions of progress and modernity as many Europeans looked at the rest of the world and saw the task of civilizing “backward” peoples as “the white man’s burden.” The wars and depressions of the first half of the twentieth century discredited that sense of Western superiority, but it returned with a vengeance after the U.S. triumph in the Cold War, and especially after the terrorist attacks of 9/11. In his most provocative claim, Bowden argues that today’s “new imperialism” -- military interventions, nation building, and financial intrusions led by the International Monetary Fund -- draws on deeply embedded assumptions about Western standards of civilization. But he never quite answers two basic questions: Is there, in fact, something called modernity? And if so, is the world heading toward it?"
71,The International Rule of Law Movement: A Crisis of Legitimacy and the Way Forward,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2014-09-30/international-rule-law-movement-crisis-legitimacy-and-way-forward,The International Rule of Law Movement: A Crisis of Legitimacy and the Way Forward,"During the last two decades, promoting the rule of law has become a global industry. Well-financed activists, governments, and international organizations have championed the cause, touting improved rule of law as a way to reduce poverty, secure human rights, and prevent conflict. All the contributors to this volume affirm the importance of promoting the rule of law in troubled and transitional societies, using tools such as foreign aid and technical assistance. Some argue that international experts need to spend more time grappling with issues of justice in aid-receiving countries and adapting their plans to local cultural and political circumstances. Others caution that there are severe limits to what can be achieved by outsiders. In his contribution, Marshall offers a hard-hitting assessment of the UN’s rule-of-law programs, which he deems unrealistically ambitious. The book’s overall message seems quite sensible: if promoting the rule of law has become an industry, that industry needs to tailor its product to local markets, listen to its consumers, remain flexible, learn from its mistakes, and assume it will be in the business for the long term."
72,Networks of Domination: The Social Foundations of Peripheral Conquest in International Politics,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2014-10-20/networks-domination-social-foundations-peripheral-conquest,Networks of Domination: The Social Foundations of Peripheral Conquest in International Politics,"In this illuminating study, MacDonald argues that the success of imperial conquest during the colonial era hinged less on brute power than on the ability of European states to build and exploit social ties with elites among the colonized. The book looks most closely at the British experience. In India, the close ties between the British and elite Indians allowed the British East India Company to raise an army, establish rule, and at least partially legitimate its presence. The United Kingdom was less successful in Nigeria and South Africa, where a lack of such ties made it harder for the British to overcome opposition to colonial rule. At the end of his book, MacDonald cannily argues that a similar dynamic hampered the U.S. occupation of Iraq. The book is a sober reminder that great military power and dreams of empire cannot guarantee control of even a small foreign country -- much less world domination."
73,Liberalism: The Life of an Idea,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2014-10-20/liberalism-life-idea,Liberalism: The Life of an Idea,"What is liberalism? The debate never ends, but Fawcett identifies a core set of liberal ideas: respect for the individual, civic equality, suspicion of power, faith in progress, and the search for an ethical order amid the great conflicts generated by a modernizing world. Fawcett traces the liberal tradition from its origins in nineteenth-century Europe, to its historic union with democracy early in the twentieth century, to its near-fatal collapse after World War I and the Great Depression, and culminating in its triumph and spread in the decades after World War II. Fawcett shows how early liberals welcomed the coming of Western advancement and believed that social change could be steered in a progressive direction through science, the accumulation of knowledge, trade, international cooperation, and healthy political institutions. As Fawcett’s compelling history reveals, the twentieth century turned out to be much more unstable and dangerous than the early liberals anticipated and has forced liberals ever since to temper their expectations for human betterment with a world-weary search for small steps that can keep the liberal international system on an upward trajectory."

It was not U.S. weakness but rather the “looming potential” of American capitalist democracy and the world order it would create that spurred radicalism in Germany, Italy, Japan, and the Soviet Union. What made the American-led new order so threatening to those illiberal powers was its combination of moral authority with military strength and economic dominance. The United States was not just another rising great power: it represented a global political project and a way of life. Tooze draws a parallel between the post–World War I period and the “unipolar moment” that followed the Soviet collapse near the end of the twentieth century. In both cases, U.S. leaders embraced an exceptionalist view of their country’s role in the world and sought to overturn a pluralistic world order based on the balance of power."
75,Homeward Bound?,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/syria/2014-10-01/homeward-bound,Homeward Bound?,"On May 24, 2014, a man opened fire inside the Jewish Museum in Brussels, quickly killing three people and fatally wounding a fourth before disappearing into the city’s streets. The alleged perpetrator, a French citizen named Mehdi Nemmouche, who has since been arrested and charged with murder, had spent the previous year fighting with jihadist opposition groups in Syria. His attack appeared to mark the first time that the Syrian civil war had spilled over into the European Union. Many security officials in Europe and the United States fear that this strike foreshadowed a spate of terrorist attacks that the chaos in Syria—and now Iraq—could trigger."

0,Women’s International Thought: A New History,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-10-19/womens-international-thought-new-history,Women’s International Thought: A New History,"In most histories of the academic field of international relations, very few women make an appearance. The “greats” in the scholarly canon are overwhelmingly Anglo-American men. In this ground-breaking book, a distinguished group of scholars engages in what the historian Glenda Sluga calls “recovery history,” reconstructing the forgotten and marginalized ideas of 18 female thinkers, including several African American women, who played formative roles in defining and launching the field beginning in the late nineteenth century. The goal of the book is not to simply add women to the traditional story of international relations scholarship but to expand and complicate the theories and debates within the field, bringing questions such as gender, race, and empire into the mainstream. The editors note that the first use of the term “international thought” can be traced to Florence Melian Stawell’s 1929 book, The Growth of International Thought, a work that has received hardly any scholarly attention. One chapter of the volume considers the contributions of Eslanda Robeson, a Black activist and intellectual whose internationalist thought focused on the struggles of women for participation in world politics. There are also chapters on the revolutionary Rosa Luxemburg and the philosopher Simone Weil, who concentrated on problems of class and colonialism. Another chapter provides an interesting portrait of Vera Micheles Dean, who as director of research for the Foreign Policy Association in the mid- twentieth century formulated a brand of liberal internationalism that emphasized cosmopolitanism and democratic solidarity. Together, the essays lay the foundation for interdisciplinary debates and new histories of the field."
1,Civil Resistance: What Everyone Needs to Know,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-10-19/civil-resistance-what-everyone-needs-know,Civil Resistance: What Everyone Needs to Know,"This is a work of advocacy as well as analysis. Civil resistance is a form of collective action in which unarmed people coordinate a variety of measures, such as work stoppages, sit-ins, hunger strikes, and boycotts. Chenoweth believes that when it comes to inspiring social change, such means are both more ethical and more effective than violence. When nonviolent activists topple a regime, for example, what follows is usually more stable and inclusive than the aftermath of a violent insurrection. She uses an impressive range of examples to address some of the more obvious objections to civil resistance as a method: that nonviolence is equivalent to passivity, that such movements can be easily suppressed with violence, that they often contain violent elements, and that they work only against democratic governments. Chenoweth sees civil resistance as a form of pressure building up from below against illegitimate and unjust practices and regimes. She identifies a close link between the tactics of civil resistance and progressive political change, implying that those who use these methods are invariably in the right. But as she acknowledges, sectarian and regressive movements can also employ civil resistance, and they frequently do."

To correct the misperceptions this has produced, she uses a wealth of examples from the annals of spycraft, from Washington’s failure to anticipate China’s entry into the Korean War to its successful search for Osama bin Laden. The digital revolution is changing the practice of intelligence as information becomes more plentiful and accessible but also more manipulable. This raises for Zegart a number of interesting questions, such as whether artificial intelligence can correct some of the cognitive biases that lead to analytic failures and how analysts can verify the authenticity of information when the Internet makes fakery so easy. She also discusses the importance of nonstate actors, including technology giants such as Google and even private individuals tracking illicit nuclear activities."

They are General Valery Gerasimov, chief of Russia’s general staff; the late Iranian major general Qasem Soleimani, who was blown up on U.S. President Donald Trump’s order in early 2020; and General Zhang Youxia, vice chair of China’s Central Military Commission. Using Russian, Farsi, and Mandarin materials, Jones shows how they all turned to irregular forms of warfare, including information campaigns on social media, as well as espionage and special operations, to weaken the United States. All three assumed a constant struggle with the West. Whereas Soleimani had a certain swagger, Gerasimov and Zhang appear as somewhat two-dimensional characters: competent, professional, and loyal to their countries’ presidents. Jones does not quite make clear whether or how these men created policy, as opposed to just articulating and implementing it. Still, he shows how menacing and disruptive their efforts can be and proposes ways to fight back. He is less convincing in arguing that these efforts are more important than building up conventional forces, at least for China and Russia."
4,"I, Warbot: The Dawn of Artificially Intelligent Conflict",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-10-19/i-warbot-dawn-artificially-intelligent-conflict,"I, Warbot: The Dawn of Artificially Intelligent Conflict","Payne has produced an engaging and accessible guide to the development of artificial intelligence (AI) as applied to war. He shows how an initial push stalled in the 1970s; what made the difference later was the remarkable increase in computing power, the amount of data being generated on the Internet, and the way engineers came to appreciate how machines can learn. Warbots are AI-enabled platforms that can make their own decisions: in principle, they can identify targets, as well as maneuver and fire, independently. From Payne’s analysis, three main conclusions emerge. First, profound ethical issues arise once machines can decide which humans to kill, but the technology is now too varied and too far advanced to be banned. Second, AI favors the offense, owing mainly to the ability of AI-enabled weapons to swarm. Third, and perhaps most important, if AI receives a lot of data and a narrow goal, it will be tactically brilliant in ways that human commanders could never match—but AI will never be a true strategist."
5,Bitskrieg: The New Challenge of Cyberwarfare,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-10-19/bitskrieg-new-challenge-cyberwarfare,Bitskrieg: The New Challenge of Cyberwarfare,"Arquilla was one of the first analysts to appreciate how digital technologies were transforming the nature of conflict, and he remains one of the most perceptive. His latest book pulls together the strands of his three decades of studying this issue. A constant theme is frustration at the failure of policymakers to adjust their thinking, despite his own efforts to advise and inform them. It took too long for them to appreciate the vulnerability of computer networks to crooks and hostile political actors. Companies and governments placed too much emphasis on firewalls and antivirus software when encryption and cloud computing offered better defenses. In addition, because military planners were reluctant to abandon the legacy systems of industrial age warfare, such as tanks, they failed to notice the potential of tactics involving numerous small units, in constant communication with one another, overwhelming targets in swarms—a form of warfare that Arquilla dubs “bitskrieg.” One distinctive feature of his approach is his belief in arms control agreements to ensure that civilians and critical infrastructure are spared harmful attacks. Sadly, despite some occasional high-level interest, there have been no serious negotiations on that issue among the major powers."
6,The Rise and Fall of OPEC in the Twentieth Century,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-10-19/rise-and-fall-opec-twentieth-century,The Rise and Fall of OPEC in the Twentieth Century,"Garavini’s rich history starts with the emergence of petroleum-producing countries in the 1920s and covers the establishment of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries in the 1960s, the oil shocks of the 1970s, and OPEC’s declining ability to control prices in the 1980s and 1990s. Garavini, a diplomatic historian, focuses on the interaction of so-called petrostates with the U.S. government, with their oil companies, and with one another. He details OPEC’s internal machinations using the minutes of the organization’s conferences, a primary source not available to previous investigators. Although Garavini’s account ends at the turn of the twenty-first century, many of the themes he sounds are strikingly contemporary: tension between Iran and Saudi Arabia, dysfunction in Venezuela, and the need for oil-producing and oil-consuming countries to think about the coming transition to a global economy that no longer relies on fossil fuels."
7,Emerging Powers and the World Trading System: The Past and Future of International Economic Law,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-10-19/emerging-powers-and-world-trading-system-past-and-future,Emerging Powers and the World Trading System: The Past and Future of International Economic Law,"The post–World War II global trading system was largely designed by the United States and was heavily criticized by developing countries, including Brazil, India, and (later) China, for placing unfair restraints on their economic development policies. Yet now, paradoxically, the United States has become a leading critic of the World Trade Organization, and emerging powers have become its chief defenders. As Shaffer explains, once emerging markets became major exporters, they developed an interest in maintaining and even strengthening the rules-based system. For its part, the United States, possessing a limited social safety net, resorted to import restrictions to protect workers and turned away from the WTO when it ruled against Washington. Importantly, emerging markets developed the legal capacity—the cadres of attorneys and negotiators with trade law expertise—needed to use global trade rules and procedures to their advantage. Shaffer argues for reinvigorating the WTO as a primary interface between the United States and China but also for revising WTO rules to provide more space for Beijing to pursue state capitalism and for Washington to intervene to protect workers from import shocks."
8,How We Give Now: A Philanthropic Guide for the Rest of Us,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-10-19/how-we-give-now-philanthropic-guide-rest-us,How We Give Now: A Philanthropic Guide for the Rest of Us,"In this thought-provoking meditation on philanthropy in the United States, Bernholz argues that such giving is an admirable American tradition but also a response to citizens’ deep and abiding skepticism about the role of government and the consequent inadequacy of public programs. The author highlights new questions for philanthropy in the digital age: For example, should individuals donate their genetic data in the name of medical research, despite privacy concerns, and should they favor nonprofits over commercial gene-sequencing companies? Economists will search in vain for data on who provides charitable donations and for what kinds of activities. But they will not search in vain for novel ideas; the book does not lack for them."
9,Making Social Spending Work,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-10-19/making-social-spending-work,Making Social Spending Work,"Lindert has produced a worthy successor to his landmark book Growing Public, which used historical evidence to describe the rise of the welfare state. Whereas that earlier book focused on the North Atlantic economies, this one paints on a global canvas. Lindert again debunks the view that government spending on social services tends to slow economic growth. He shows that social programs help equalize incomes, even in countries such as the United States, where their scope is relatively limited. But he also points to worrisome trends: too many countries invest too little in high-return social programs, such as education for the young, and spend too much on pensions for the politically influential elderly. The author concludes by exploring whether immigration tensions will further fray social safety nets and whether increases in life expectancy will threaten the solvency of public pensions or crowd out other valuable forms of social spending—and, if so, how social programs might be redesigned to meet these risks."

With her background in government, consulting, and academia, Coyle offers a better-informed critique. Economists, she shows, understand the limitations of their models; a growing amount of their research is devoted to analyzing big data as opposed to abstract theory; and they increasingly interact with those in other disciplines. Too often, however, economists forget that they are part of the system they are analyzing and that their work can affect its operation—as, for example, academic work on finance has affected the organization of financial markets, and not always for the better. Economists also ignore the tendency for their findings to be oversimplified when applied to policy, sometimes with counterproductive consequences. They sometimes fail to ask whether their familiar statistical and conceptual categories still apply in today’s digital world. And they have a diversity problem: the profession lacks not just intellectual range but also the ethnic, racial, and gender balance that would enrich the field."
11,A World After Liberalism: Philosophers of the Radical Right,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-10-19/world-after-liberalism-philosophers-radical-right,A World After Liberalism: Philosophers of the Radical Right,"Across the Western world, right-wing activists and movements have grown louder in recent years. As Rose argues in this fascinating book, today’s various nationalists, populists, religious traditionalists, and racial supremacists form the vanguard of a “conservative revolution” with deep roots in the twentieth century, and they are now charting a path to a postliberal future. To illuminate the origins of this century’s postliberal wave, Rose profiles major intellectual figures of the radical right prominent in the last century. The German historian Oswald Spengler developed an account of world history as a series of cultural struggles rooted in unbridgeable divides of blood, soil, language, and tradition. Alain de Benoist was a prophet of the French far right in his heyday, developing a theory of “folk democracy” in which all peoples had the right to protect their customs, cultures, and ethnic identities from the effects of liberalism. Francis Parker Yockey was the preeminent American theorist of authoritarianism, envisioning an alliance between a postliberal America and a post-Soviet Russia. To these thinkers, liberal democracy and its hallowed principles represented antiquarian relics of an Enlightenment age that threatened Western culture and identity. They may seem obscure to many readers, but they are well known and well regarded by the adherents of political movements that pose a serious threat to liberalism around the world today."
12,Making the World Safe for Dictatorship,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-10-19/making-world-safe-dictatorship,Making the World Safe for Dictatorship,"All states engage in public diplomacy to burnish their images abroad. But today’s authoritarian states, operating in a global system that has elevated norms of democracy and human rights, have extra incentives to engage in image promotion. As Dukalskis shows in this intriguing book, authoritarian states protect and enhance their legitimacy and standing with a range of practices, from standard advertising campaigns to high-risk extraterritorial operations to apprehend and silence critics. Regimes such as Kazakhstan’s routinely employ Western public relations firms in campaigns to promote the country’s achievements. Russia engages in more systematic efforts to censor, obscure, and refute unfavorable information, using its infamous Internet “troll farms” to distract and discredit critics. China has sought to persuade foreign elites to view the state favorably through junkets for journalists and policymakers, and its state-owned media outlets offer positive accounts of the Chinese regime. North Korea, Russia, and Saudi Arabia have all reportedly assassinated dissidents living abroad. Dukalskis argues that the best way to counter authoritarian propaganda is to promote transparency, protect information flows, and stand up for democratic values."

The kings of ancient Mesopotamia wrapped their laws in grand statements of social justice and the dictates of the gods. Chinese emperors claimed that the laws on which their authority rested were manifestations of the order of the cosmos. The world religions promulgated laws that were guides for living and a pathway to the afterlife, entangling church and state and setting the stage for struggles in medieval Europe to build secular systems of law. The age of Western empire brought with it ambitious efforts by European states to organize and legitimate their imperial conquests in a system of international law. Pirie shows that laws protect against the abuse of power but also serve as instruments of social control. Laws can be used as both swords and shields in the struggle for power and order. Pirie argues that if the history of law has a common theme, it is that laws are not simply rules: they have a more overarching function in providing societies with shared identities and moral visions."
14,The War of Words: A Glossary of Globalization,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-10-19/war-words-glossary-globalization,The War of Words: A Glossary of Globalization,"In this masterful exercise in “intellectual decluttering,” James cuts through the tangled terminological and conceptual jungle of modern globalist discourse. All the major ideas make an appearance: capitalism, socialism, democracy, populism, nationalism, technocracy, and so on. The book takes the form of a glossary: each of those concepts gets its own chapter, organized around fascinating discussions of the origins and meanings of the words used to describe them. Many of the terms have gone through a sort of conceptual life cycle: emerging and gaining currency in a particular historical moment, often during a global crisis or a rapid transformation in the world economy; being deployed in discursive battles between advocates and critics; and over time slowly losing their precise meaning as more and more connotations and ideological usages undermine the original idea. The book can also be read as a history of the modern global system, in which the terms stand in as markers for upheavals, innovations, and transformations in markets and politics. Particularly revealing chapters on the terms “neoliberalism” and “globalization” show the complex ways in which scholarly ideas have been weaponized for political struggle. James argues that successfully navigating today’s technological revolutions and upheavals in global capitalism will require the invention of new concepts."

The study of this phenomenon is a growing field, but so far, it focuses mostly on Western countries—the United States, in particular, provides a striking example of what is happening. The way it is playing out in the post-Soviet world, however, remains largely unexplored."
16,A Full-Value Ruble: The Promise of Prosperity in the Postwar Soviet Union,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-10-19/full-value-ruble-promise-prosperity-postwar-soviet-union,A Full-Value Ruble: The Promise of Prosperity in the Postwar Soviet Union,"In her study of Soviet economic policies from the late 1940s to the mid-1960s, Ironside contests the view that money had limited value in the Soviet system. She demonstrates that Soviet postwar governments were very concerned with increasing the ruble’s purchasing power as a means to economic growth and eventual abundance. This goal, however, remained unfulfilled. By examining political leaders’ beliefs, economic experts’ debates, and citizens’ complaints to the authorities, Ironside shows how a variety of economic policies introduced in the decades after World War II repeatedly led to the accumulation of unspendable money in the hands of the people. The Soviet leader Joseph Stalin slashed consumer prices, but amid an acute food shortage, there was little for people to buy. His successor, Nikita Khrushchev, opted instead to raise pensions and the wages of low-paid workers and to eliminate certain taxes, but that led to wage overspending—and without a rise in productivity, the demand for goods still exceeded the supply. The resulting surplus of cash further undermined the ruble. The government tried various means, such as compulsory mass—subscription bonds, lotteries, and savings deposits, to absorb the excess cash, but these instruments steadily increased the government’s debt to its own citizens—which remained unpaid through the end of the Soviet Union in 1991."
17,Nuclear Folly: A History of the Cuban Missile Crisis,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-10-19/nuclear-folly-history-cuban-missile-crisis,Nuclear Folly: A History of the Cuban Missile Crisis,"Plokhy discovered a few previously unknown documents relating to the Cuban missile crisis, and although his research does not essentially change the story, his outstanding talent for weaving a narrative from myriad sources makes his new book hard to put down. Readers witness tense debates in the White House as President John F. Kennedy’s aides reject his idea of a compromise with the Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev; listen in as Robert Kennedy reports to his brother on the result of his super-secret mission to the Soviet ambassador, Anatoly Dobrynin; and peek into the room next door, where the president’s young lover is sleeping. Plohky also shares Soviet soldiers’ recollections of unbearable heat, poisonous plants, and worm-infested food during their time in Cuba and relates the anxiety of the Soviet envoy Anastas Mikoyan as he failed to placate the Cuban leader Fidel Castro, who was furious at what he saw as Khruschev’s betrayal. Plokhy focuses on the many mistakes made by both major and minor participants during the crisis. In his answer to the perennial question of who blinked first, he emphasizes that both sides were operating in “a dark room of deception and mutual suspicion,” so “when one side blinked, it took the other side more than a day to realize what had happened.”"
18,Russian Energy Chains: The Remaking of Technopolitics From Siberia to Ukraine to the European Union,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-10-19/russian-energy-chains-remaking-technopolitics-siberia-ukraine,Russian Energy Chains: The Remaking of Technopolitics From Siberia to Ukraine to the European Union,"Balmaceda criticizes the conventional understanding of Russian energy power that reduces it to a mere state-held weapon used by Moscow against the former Soviet states. Her own analysis is focused on value chains—the separate paths taken by Russian natural gas, oil, and coal from their production in Siberia, through Ukraine, and to consumers in the European Union. In the countries through which they pass, these value chains deeply permeate politics and business. For some important players, their country’s energy dependence on Russia may turn out to be an opportunity rather than a constraint. Ukraine’s major energy oligarchs are a striking example. Dmytro Firtash, Ihor Kolomoisky, and Rinat Akhmetov were able to build tremendous fortunes by extracting rents in the natural gas, oil, and coal sectors, respectively, and turn their wealth into political power. Meanwhile, Ukraine’s industrial capacity continued to decline, and its role as a transit country weakened. All three oligarchs remain powerful today, even as Russia has moved to drastically reduce Ukraine’s transit role by launching the Nord Stream project, which will bypass Ukraine and bring Russian gas directly to Germany through a pipeline under the Baltic Sea."

Although mid-twentieth-century Latin America offered a safe haven from European barbarisms, the conservative Roman Catholic societies of the region were hardly free from anti-Semitism. Still, Lomnitz’s well-networked, intelligent, and hard-working family survived and even prospered. Yet they remained haunted by the unspeakable traumas of the Holocaust, even as parents sought to shield their children from truths too awful to recite. Based on his meticulous research, Lomnitz speculates that his great-grandfather, a successful businessman in Mannheim, Germany, was assassinated in his office by young Nazis—envious neighbors of his—as early as 1922. In more hopeful passages, he recounts how his relatives brushed shoulders with such luminaries as the Peruvian Marxist José Carlos Mariátegui and the Chilean folk composer Violeta Parra. Hanging over this poignant history is a disturbing question: Might today’s resurgence of identity politics and conspiracy theories, similarly rooted in historical revanchism and social envy, lead to yet another round of violent nightmares?"
20,Two Spies in Caracas: A Novel,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/two-spies-caracas-novel,Two Spies in Caracas: A Novel,"Naím, who left his native Venezuela many years ago, turns to historical fiction to pen this sharp, effective indictment of Hugo Chávez and the late tyrant’s brand of authoritarian populism. Readers of political thrillers may intuit early on the resolution of the deadly duel between two opposing spies—a gorgeous female CIA operative and an irresistibly charming male officer in Cuba’s Intelligence Directorate. Operating in worlds populated by corruption and deception, they are among the few characters with any moral fiber; the fast-paced plot turns on the alliance between a money-laundering American evangelist preacher and a Venezuelan criminal who masterminds his illicit syndicates from prison with impunity. This nasty world is not so unlike those Naím has uncovered in his award-winning nonfiction, in which legitimate leaders and private business executives, interlaced with violent Mafias, engage in intricate power struggles and some civil society leaders can be as hypocritical as the politicians they decry. In his acknowledgments, Naím reasserts his faith that his “wonderful country” will recover. But from the deep abyss depicted in his novel, it is difficult to perceive the green shoots of a reborn Venezuela."
21,The Transparency of Time: A Novel,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-10-19/transparency-time-novel,The Transparency of Time: A Novel,"In this erudite crime thriller, Padura, Cuba’s leading man of letters, pilots his melancholic, irreverent detective, Mario Conde, toward his 60th birthday. The plot, revolving around a stolen wooden statue of the Black Virgin, of medieval origin, is a vehicle for the author’s trenchant commentaries on contemporary Cuba and his existential ruminations on the human condition. Situated in 2014, before U.S. President Donald Trump’s intensified economic sanctions and COVID-19’s disruption of tourism, the book describes a Cuba already suffering from poverty and postrevolutionary inequalities; readers visit the sumptuous private restaurants and homes of the elites (new and old), as well as peripheral shantytowns populated by darker-skinned migrants (popularly labeled “Palestinians”) from the eastern provinces. In a parallel narrative located during the murderous, chaotic medieval Crusades, Padura ponders whether ideologies and religions merely disguise the human drive for power and wealth; he also asks whether revolutionaries elevate or immiserate their populations—questions echoed by Cuba’s contemporary fate. Surrounded by his country’s material and moral decay, the mature Conde finds solace in an enduring love relationship and in his steadfast circle of lifelong drinking buddies."
22,The Wealth of Refugees: How Displaced People Can Build Economies,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-10-19/wealth-refugees-how-displaced-people-can-build-economies,The Wealth of Refugees: How Displaced People Can Build Economies,"Today, there are more than 25 million people who have left their countries of origin because of some combination of economic, environmental, and political crises. Such refugees often feature in Western media as a burden on the rich countries of the developed world. In fact, the overwhelming majority remain in the region of their homeland, as Betts makes clear in this informative account of contemporary refugee policy. The three East African countries that provide the main case studies for the book—Ethiopia, Kenya, and Uganda—alone account for some three million refugees today. Betts’s central argument is that even in low-income hosting countries, the right mix of policies can ensure that refugees not merely survive in misery but can instead thrive and generate wealth for themselves, their communities, and the host country. In particular, his analysis suggests that providing refugees with civil and economic rights, allowing them to work, and integrating them more completely in the receiving communities can lead to much better outcomes."

That is how the company came to invest in a rubber plantation in Liberia. Over time, and with help from accommodating governments in the United States and Liberia, the company came to dominate the country’s economy and policymaking to a remarkable extent. Mitman peppers this history with a wealth of fascinating details and interesting characters. Most readers will be surprised to learn, for instance, that one of the early boosters of the venture was the American civil rights leader W. E. B. Du Bois, who would soon regret having believed that Fire-stone could hasten the emergence of an independent African bourgeoisie. Instead, as Mitman demonstrates, Firestone and its supporters in the U.S. government brought to relations with Liberia the attitudes and practices of Jim Crow—even long after World War II. A long succession of Liberian heads of state were willing to play along not least because, with the help of Firestone, they invested in very profitable rubber plantations of their own."

But the fighting never stopped. Stearns’s book seeks to explain why, despite major UN peacekeeping missions and substantial foreign aid, the last two decades have been marked by regular outbreaks of violence in the eastern and northeastern regions of the country. Stearns details the emergence of warlords with ambiguous motivations, the repeated interventions by Rwanda and Uganda, and the role of the incompetent and rapacious national army. An old Congo hand who appears to have interviewed all the key players, Stearns does not offer a linear history of the conflict, instead moving back and forth across the two decades to develop his arguments. But he makes a convincing case that the violence has been sustained by a “military bourgeoisie” that benefits from instability by plundering natural resources and foreign aid. The government has made things worse by shelling out “fighting bonuses” to military personnel that dwarf their peacetime salaries. The violence has created a small but influential ruling class that has little motivation to end the bloodshed."

Aside from two short chapters on the organization’s formative years and its turn to violence, Omeni’s highly original study focuses instead on trying to explain the group’s success over the last few decades as a fighting force. He analyzes its ability to benefit from the rugged environment in which it operates, in northeastern Nigeria, on the borders with Cameroon, Chad, and Niger. He then turns to its military tactics. Many analyses of the group emphasize its use of seemingly indiscriminate violence against civilians, including kidnappings and suicide bombings. Omeni argues, however, that Boko Haram has sometimes operated as a more traditional insurgency and has exhibited both organizational resilience and a good deal of strategic savvy in its choice of targets and its ability to surprise the Nigerian army with changing tactics. The book also includes a useful discussion of the group’s relationship with the Islamic State (also known as ISIS), which ultimately led Boko Haram to fragment into two rival factions in 2016. Unfortunately, the book does not discuss the implications of the recent death of Abubakar Shekau, who had led the organization since 2009."
26,Blood and Diamonds: Germany’s Imperial Ambitions in Africa,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-10-19/blood-and-diamonds-germanys-imperial-ambitions-africa,Blood and Diamonds: Germany’s Imperial Ambitions in Africa,"Press has written an excellent history of Germany’s colony German South West Africa, a place that eventually gained independence as the country of Namibia in 1990. The book looks at the story through the prism of diamonds, the colony’s main source of revenue and exports. This is a smart choice, as it allows Press to range widely, from the day-to-day activities in the diamond fields, to business intrigue in Berlin, to the shady politics of the international diamond trade in Antwerp, Johannesburg, and London. German South West Africa was founded in the 1880s to further the imperial ambitions of German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck, and Press’s account shows that the colony well deserved its reputation for brutal violence. His careful economic history makes clear the importance of diamonds to the survival of the colony and to Germany’s economic reach at the time, as South West African diamonds came to dominate the huge retail market for gems in the United States. As in almost every colony, this natural resource wealth mostly benefited the imperial rulers back home, especially a small number of German banks and businessmen. The colony’s infrastructure remained rudimentary, most of the small German settler population lived in poverty, and the indigenous African labor force toiled to mine alluvial diamonds under horrendous conditions."

Inboden’s revealing behind-the-scenes case studies show how China’s human rights diplomacy has become increasingly sophisticated. When the UN Convention Against Torture was drafted, in the early 1980s, China was relatively passive. But during negotiations over the convention’s optional protocol, in the 1990s, it worked (along with the United States and others) to weaken the ability of an independent anti-torture subcommittee to inspect places of detention in signatory states. In the following decade, when the UN’s new Human Rights Council was writing its rules of operation, China worked with others to block proposals that would have made the council more effective, such as a human rights good-behavior requirement for states to join the council. The book’s third case study tracks China’s use of the compliance-monitoring committee of the International Labor Organization as a venue to trade favors with like-minded regimes that want to avoid scrutiny. With well-staffed missions in Geneva and New York, China is a player wherever human rights norms are shaped and applied."
28,The Political Economy of the Abe Government and Abenomics Reforms,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-10-19/political-economy-abe-government-and-abenomics-reforms,The Political Economy of the Abe Government and Abenomics Reforms,"The 25 expert contributors to this book analyze how Shinzo Abe managed not only to stay in office for eight years, from 2012 to 2020—the longest term of any Japanese prime minister—but to carry out a series of major institutional reforms and stimulate the economy. Having learned the lessons of his failed first term as prime minister (2006–7), Abe actively managed public opinion, used strategically timed elections to discipline factions in his ruling party, and increased staffing in the Cabinet Secretariat and the prime minister’s office to control the bureaucracy. His economic policies, known as “Abenomics,” accelerated existing programs to promote innovation, upgrade working conditions, boost female workforce participation, and reduce the power of the national association of agricultural cooperatives over farmers’ business decisions, among other gains. But several chapters puzzle over why monetary easing and fiscal stimulus under Abe drove smaller-than-desired increases in inflation and economic growth. Many chapters are technical, but the book’s core leader-centered analysis gains credibility from the fact that Abe’s successor, Yoshihide Suga, had the same tools as Abe but was less successful. Abe would doubtless pick up his agenda again if he were to return to office for a third term."
29,The Road to Dien Bien Phu: A History of the First War for Vietnam,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-10-19/road-dien-bien-phu-history-first-war-vietnam,The Road to Dien Bien Phu: A History of the First War for Vietnam,"Goscha’s zestfully granular history of the Vietminh war against the French, which lasted from 1946 to 1954, challenges the myth that Ho Chi Minh’s forces bested the professional French army simply because they were fighting for national liberation. He focuses on a less understood and more practical factor: Ho’s creation of a party-controlled governing apparatus with the capacity to recruit, finance, arm, coordinate, and deploy armed forces. Even from its early days as what Goscha calls an “archipelago state,” Ho’s regime administered a network of territories, drafted soldiers, kept records, conducted police work, issued currency, taxed commerce, and carried on international trade. With Chinese support, Ho then expanded his organizational machine into a Leninist-style “wartime state,” able to field the well-equipped conventional army that besieged and overran the French garrison at Dien Bien Phu. The Vietminh was a modern Asian example of the late sociologist Charles Tilly’s insight, drawn from the history of early modern Europe, that “war made the state, and the state made war”—in this case, however, with the help of organizational techniques, weapons, and training from a powerful neighbor."

The negotiations dragged on for two years because the United States insisted on the “voluntary repatriation” of Chinese prisoners of war. This ostensibly humanitarian concept was unacceptable to the Chinese side (although Beijing eventually yielded), violated the newly signed Geneva Convention on the treatment of POWS, and, as the war continued, cost tragically large losses of life among soldiers and POWS on both sides and among North Korean civilians. Chang shows that the true reason for the U.S. policy was the desire for a propaganda victory over China. Most of the 14,000 Chinese POWS who ultimately decided to go to Taiwan did so as a result of an American “reindoctrination/exploitation” program in the camps that was violently reinforced by a core group of anticommunist prisoners and Chinese Nationalist agents. Chang’s exceptionally vivid prisoner’s-eye account, based on camp archives and interviews with ex-POWS, leads him to condemn the key U.S. policymakers, including President Harry Truman and Secretary of State Dean Acheson, for their “arrogance, ignorance, and negligence.”"
31,Kashmir at the Crossroads: Inside a Twenty-First-Century Conflict,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-10-19/kashmir-crossroads-inside-twenty-first-century-conflict,Kashmir at the Crossroads: Inside a Twenty-First-Century Conflict,"Over three-quarters of a century, the contested territory of Kashmir has been the locus of four wars between India and Pakistan, frequent firing and shelling incidents across the so-called Line of Control, Pakistani-sponsored terrorist incursions into the Indian-occupied sector called Jammu and Kashmir, conflict between the Muslim majority and the Hindu minority, a protracted insurgency in Jammu and Kashmir and an abusive Indian counterinsurgency, and, to the east, clashes between Chinese and Indian forces over the Chinese-occupied sector called Aksai Chin. More recently, Pakistani security agencies have disrupted peace talks by dispatching terrorist proxies to attack Indian interests, and Jammu and Kashmir has been swept by renewed waves of resistance; and in 2019, the Hindu nationalist government of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi imposed direct central government control over the sector in what is bound to be a futile attempt to crush all opposition. Meanwhile, China increased its military pressure in Aksai Chin. Bose traces these events in intimate detail. His analysis suggests that peace is more remote than ever."
32,Two Books on Chinese Economic Influence,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-10-19/two-books-chinese-economic-influence,Two Books on Chinese Economic Influence,"These deeply informed books challenge the view that China’s growing economic influence around the world will inevitably lead to Chinese political and military domination. Markey demonstrates that in Iran, Kazakhstan, and Pakistan, China seeks energy resources, more secure transport routes, and deference to its repression of the Uyghurs. But Beijing shows little interest in intervening in other countries’ domestic problems or in solving its partner states’ conflicts with their neighbors. To be sure, the Chinese presence reduces U.S. influence and buttresses authoritarian regimes with diplomatic support and new surveillance technology. But the partner governments themselves—and neighboring regional powers, such as India, Russia, and Saudi Arabia—are keen to set limits on Chinese influence. So China’s rising presence in continental Eurasia is unlikely to lead to anything resembling hegemony."
33,Women Rising: In and Beyond the Arab Spring,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-10-19/women-rising-and-beyond-arab-spring,Women Rising: In and Beyond the Arab Spring,"Women in the Middle East and North Africa are typically portrayed as victims—of patriarchy and poverty, war and violence, Orientalism and imperialism. This book suggests, very convincingly, that they are victimized just as much by the antiquated platitudes, stereotypes, and distortions with which they are portrayed. In a collection of 40 short pieces by scholars and activists, the editors showcase a stunning variety of domains in which women are operating on their own behalf and in the service of others. Graffiti artists, journalists, filmmakers, teachers, bloggers, government ministers, community organizers, and political activists are debating constitutional reform in Tunisia, advocating feminism in Islam in Syria, supporting independence in southern Yemen, developing gender studies in Morocco, calling for restorative justice in Libya, demanding an end to sexual harassment in Egypt, advancing gay rights in Lebanon. Although the seeds of this activism were planted as early as the 1920s, Stephan and Charrad argue compellingly that the Arab uprisings of 2010–11 emboldened a generation of women who are now more active, more visible, and more influential in the politics and social life of the region than ever before. Despite all appearances, the editors suggest, there has been a subtle democratization of politics, as bottom-up pressure is forcing greater accountability on often reluctant regimes. The Arab Spring left important traces, visible today in the growing prominence and authority of women."

There is little surprising in his version of this still sorry story: the shah was an indecisive autocrat; his American enablers were often distracted and ill informed; most of the monarchy’s officials were politically naive, and many were simply corrupt sycophants. Takeyh has a soft spot for the old aristocracy, arguing that, however elitist it may have been, it had a far more sensitive finger on the pulse of the countryside than the clueless technocrats who implemented the shah’s U.S.-sponsored programs of land reform and educational development. Whether the landed nobility would have been able to understand and respond to frustrations among peasants and students—complaints that the revolutionary Islamists exploited effectively—remains an open question. What is striking, however, is the number of senior figures in the regime who, rather than stand their ground, simply decamped to Europe or the United States as Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini’s revolution gathered steam, abandoning not just the shah but also the country they had enabled him to rule."
35,Turkish Kaleidoscope: Fractured Lives in a Time of Violence,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-10-19/turkish-kaleidoscope-fractured-lives-time-violence,Turkish Kaleidoscope: Fractured Lives in a Time of Violence,"A graphic novel based on the civil unrest that seized Turkey in the 1970s and led to the military coup of 1980, this book endeavors to capture the excitement, confusion, and, it appears, ultimate futility of the political activism of that era. White, an American anthropologist who was a student in Turkey at the time, and Gunduz, a Turkish artist and illustrator, collaborated to follow the political careers of four fictional student activists—two rightists and two leftists—as they clash over issues and causes they seem to understand poorly. As their battles spiral into factionalism and violence, they sacrifice family harmony, long-standing friendships, and promising professional careers. White correctly argues that the format of the graphic novel avoids the flattened abstractions of conventional academic analysis, but the book begs for an epilogue that would draw more universal conclusions and go beyond the wistful reminiscences decades later of now middle-aged protagonists. After all, the groups to which these young people pledged allegiance, whatever their putative ideologies, are all portrayed as being led by intolerant autocrats. In a different format, White and Gunduz might have shared their own speculation about what may or may not have changed in Turkey in the intervening decades."

A Lebanese Egyptian, she’d spent most of her life in Lebanon, moving to Egypt only in 2004. When the revolution broke out, she was teaching at the American University in Cairo and was the mother of young children and an artist with a budding international career. (At the time, I was serving as president of the university.) Already well regarded for her work on Arabic calligraphy, she had started a project called “A Thousand Times NO,” in which she explored the various ways the word “no” has been written in Arabic over the centuries. As the upheaval unfolded, she was inspired, as were many previously politically inactive Egyptians. She took to the streets, contributing to a remarkable flowering of public art as a graffiti artist, stenciling variations of works from “A Thousand Times NO” across Cairo. It was a period of extraordinary artistic creativity, and Shehab’s memoir recounts the emotional intensity and artistic inspiration of the period—and, better yet, illuminates it on page after page with her vivid photographs of both her own work and that of other graffiti artists working in Cairo at the time. The book’s title comes from a line of the Chilean poet Pablo Neruda’s that was scrawled across the walls of Cairo: “You can crush the flowers, but you can’t stop the spring.” The memoir is evocative and moving; the illustrations an important piece of the historical record."
37,Archive Wars: The Politics of History in Saudi Arabia,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-10-19/archive-wars-politics-history-saudi-arabia,Archive Wars: The Politics of History in Saudi Arabia,"This book is an intelligent, subtle, and learned treatment of the efforts by the Saudi Arabian monarchy to construct and disseminate a historical narrative that will legitimize its rule. Bsheer precisely and elegantly describes the regime’s attempts, across the reigns of several kings, to both collect and suppress documentation about the country’s past. But the book is about more than archives. Ever since the Saudi royal family faced damaging criticism for its cooperation with non-Muslim powers in the 1990–91 Gulf War, the monarchy has systematically pivoted away from reliance on the Wahhabi religious establishment, which had been its staunchest ally, and has constructed a secular nationalist narrative placing itself at the center of the story. Doing so, Bsheer reveals, has involved a variety of revisionist steps, from trying to obliterate evidence of the lively and varied political debates of the late Ottoman era to seizing property and destroying old neighborhoods in order to transform Mecca and Medina from pilgrimage sites into tourist destinations. Much of the work of this “historic preservation”—consolidating national archives, creating national museums, developing the historic birthplace of the Saud family, north of Riyadh, as a heritage site—was overseen by the current king, Salman, during his decades as the governor of Riyadh, and it has been embraced and accelerated under the current crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman."
38,Liars in High Places,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/review-essay/2021-10-19/liars-high-places,Liars in High Places,"Americans lie on their résumés, in their dating profiles, in campaign ads, in their memoirs, and, perhaps most of all, on social media. Thanks to the First Amendment, they can mostly do so with impunity—or, at any rate, without fearing that the government will punish them for it. In most contexts, the First Amendment prohibits the government from restricting speech because of its message. It makes it difficult for public figures to win defamation suits. It precludes the government from criminalizing falsehoods that don’t cause serious harm. As a result, Americans enjoy broad freedom to say things that aren’t true."

40,The Inevitable Rivalry,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2021-10-19/inevitable-rivalry-cold-war,The Inevitable Rivalry,"It was a momentous choice. Three decades ago, the Cold War ended, and the United States had won. It was now the sole great power on the planet. Scanning the horizon for threats, U.S. policymakers seemed to have little cause for concern—and especially not about China, a weak and impoverished country that had been aligned with the United States against the Soviet Union for over a decade. But there were some ominous signs: China had nearly five times as many people as the United States, and its leaders had embraced economic reform. Population size and wealth are the main building blocks of military power, so there was a serious possibility that China might become dramatically stronger in the decades to come. Since a mightier China would surely challenge the U.S. position in Asia and possibly beyond, the logical choice for the United States was clear: slow China’s rise."
41,Civilizations: A Novel,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-10-19/civilizations-novel,Civilizations: A Novel,"Binet playfully imagines a counterfactual history in which the Aztecs and the Incas conquer western Europe. His entertaining style blends biting satire of late medieval European follies with postmodern irony. Seen through the eyes of the pragmatic Incan emperor Atahuallpa, sixteenth-century Christendom is plagued by perpetual dynastic and religious wars, ridiculous superstitions, and shocking social injustice. Just as the Spanish conquistadors did in reality, Binet’s fictional Incas form alliances with conquered, restive populations. But unlike the Europeans, the Incas impose a progressive social order. Meanwhile, the brilliant Cuban princess Higuénamota intimidates European courts with her brown-skinned nakedness; Michelangelo is commissioned to make a sculpture of her. In passing, Binet lampoons Christopher Columbus, Martin Luther, and Thomas More and has great fun transporting the Spanish novelist Miguel de Cervantes and the artist El Greco to an idyllic island in the Caribbean. As a redemptive fantasy rescuing history from the horrific tragedy of the European destruction of the precolonial Americas, Civilizations is a most satisfying read."
42,Amazônia,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-10-19/amazonia,Amazônia,"Salgado, a famed Paris-based Brazilian documentary photographer, takes his camera deep into the Amazon rainforest. To tackle this vast territory, larger than the European Union and inhabited, Salgado estimates, by some 370,00 indigenous people (compared with an estimated five million prior to European conquest in the sixteenth century) belonging to nearly 200 tribes, Salgado, accompanied by anthropologists and linguists, spent weeks on end with each of a dozen remote communities. The hospitable tribes, scattered in tiny communities, subsist in bucolic harmony with an abundant, generous natural world yet are dwarfed by the natural immensity of the rainforest. The voluminous book’s brief texts add informative context, but Salgado mainly allows the captivating black-and-white photos to speak for themselves. The rainforest’s startling beauty and majesty are overwhelming; amazing aerial photography captures breathtaking cloud formations that offer an ever-changing visual spectacle. But the greatest contribution of Amazônia is its intimate, sensitive portraits of everyday life among the indigenous tribes: their warm family ties, their hunting and fishing skills, their dazzling facial and body paintings, and their ritual dances. Salgado neither patronizes nor sensationalizes. He honors his subjects by capturing both their communal and their individual selves: avoiding a flaw found in some documentary work depicting indigenous people, he accompanies every photograph of a person with the subject’s full name."

But it certainly is entertaining. In an old-school manner, Jones weaves together brief biographical sketches of colorful people, from Attila the Hun to Martin Luther, with engaging yarns about the critical events in which they took part. He nods to historiographic fashion just long enough to inquire about the impact of climate change and to ask why European countries rose to global preeminence in this period. But in the end, his question-begging answer is simply that they had grown stronger and richer, and he tells that tale without much criticism of its more brutal aspects. Still, the resulting account of the Middle Ages is as engaging a read as any."
44,The Greeks: A Global History,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-10-19/greeks-global-history,The Greeks: A Global History,"When people think of Greece, they generally think of the present-day nation-state, which they imagine as roughly conterminous with a narrowly bounded ancient society that had Athens and a few neighboring cities at its center. In this magisterial yet readable introduction to Greek history—one of the best of its kind, whether for academic or popular audiences—Beaton reveals the far more complicated reality. Greece has always been a broadly settled civilization: Greeks have long lived in parts of present-day Bulgaria, Cyprus, Italy, Russia, Turkey, and countries of the Middle East. In 1830, modern Greece gained its independence not via a popular ethnic revolution: most of its inhabitants spoke Albanian, and three times as many Greeks lived outside the country’s borders as did inside. Instead, Greek independence resulted from the work of warlords, outside powers, and generic Orthodox Christian opposition to Ottoman rule. The new state had to impose a sanitized version of the Greek language and a sense of national identity within its territory. Many of contemporary Greece’s problems with its neighbors are rooted in past wars waged by the Greeks to assert that identity; others spring from its status as a small country subject to many indignities, only one of which is its financial tutelage under the European Union."

Norway’s Liberal Democracy Since 1814,"Norwegians enjoy a well-functioning liberal democracy, a productive free-market economy, stable social relations, and—even more so than other Scandinavian countries—a generous and popular social welfare state. In global rankings of equality, gender balance, happiness, life expectancy, and the rule of law, Norway invariably appears near the top. In this book, two historians seek to explain why the country is so successful. They enthusiastically recount the country’s history, yet they fail to answer the question. Much of Norway’s edge seems to reflect dumb luck: the country benefits from abundant energy resources, peaceful neighbors, and a strong sense of national identity. Elsewhere, however, these things have led to conflict and collapse. The magic ingredient, the authors argue, is trust: Norwegians trust one another and trust their government, which can thus effectively promote the common good. Yet are they trusting simply because their system has always worked, or does their system work because they are more trusting? If the latter, why? In the end, it is unclear what foreigners can learn from Norway’s success."
46,European Language Matters: English in Its European Context,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-10-19/european-language-matters-english-its-european-context,European Language Matters: English in Its European Context,"Because of the global reach of first the United Kingdom and later the United States, the world language today is imperfect English, spoken by well over a billion people. The majority learn it as a second language—and according to some (generally British) native speakers, other (generally American) native speakers do not speak it properly. Meanwhile, English has become the de facto European language, although among the EU member states, only two embrace it as one of their official languages: Ireland and Malta. One could not wish for a more qualified guide to the resulting chaos than Trudgill, a linguist who writes a popular column for The New European. He revels in English’s massive and diverse vocabulary, with its finely shaded differentiations among near synonyms, a result of historical interactions with other languages and dialects. He delights in each tidbit of knowledge: the word “metaphor,” for example, has a figurative meaning in English but is found on delivery trucks in Athens that “transfer things from place to place.” Trudgill rues the way that many English words lose their power and precision when employed indiscriminately, as with the superlative “awesome.” For anyone, native speaker or not, this book offers a pleasurable and humorous voyage of discovery."
47,The Ambassadors: Thinking About Diplomacy From Machiavelli to Modern Times,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-10-19/ambassadors-thinking-about-diplomacy-machiavelli-modern-times,The Ambassadors: Thinking About Diplomacy From Machiavelli to Modern Times,"For many years, Cooper, a British diplomat, was the European Union’s unofficial foreign policy guru, and from 2002 to 2010, he served as the union’s director general for external and politico-military affairs. EU insiders see him as a tough and thoughtful analyst. This sweeping reflection on 500 years of transatlantic statecraft focuses on a small number of individuals who, in his view, combined sophisticated thinking with effective diplomatic action: Machiavelli, Talleyrand, Konrad Adenauer, Jean Monnet, Dean Acheson, George Kennan, and Henry Kissinger. Cooper draws three main conclusions. The first is that diplomatic success requires extreme inconsistency and immorality. To get important things done, diplomats must often mislead or mistreat the public and, often, their political masters; many will surely find it troubling that he hails Talleyrand and Kissinger as models. At the same time, Cooper portrays most foreign-policy making as little more than a desperate, often futile effort to navigate in the face of deep uncertainty, “black swan” events, and unintended consequences. And he traces a centuries-long spread of liberal values, democratic institutions, multilateral cooperation, and the use of diplomacy instead of military force—preconditions for the peaceful and prosperous world one finds within the EU. These three conclusions remain in considerable, and perhaps irreconcilable, tension with one another."

This critical decade set the tone for geopolitics in the post–Cold War period, above all though the expansion of NATO. Sarotte weaves together the most engaging and carefully documented account of this period in East-West diplomacy currently available. She deepens the conventional wisdom among most historians, namely that in the late 1980s and early 1990s, many Western leaders gave informal assurances that NATO would not expand—not just to the territory of the former East Germany but also across central and eastern Europe. Since Moscow failed to secure any formal guarantee, however, Western leaders later went ahead anyway, downplaying or denying any contradiction. She argues more speculatively that this perceived betrayal was a major factor in the subsequent collapse of democracy in Russia and the further deterioration of relations between the West and Russia under President Vladimir Putin. But most of the book’s evidence actually leans in the opposite direction and suggests that U.S. Presidents George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton and their top diplomats slowed NATO expansion to try to stabilize the government of Russian President Boris Yeltsin in the short term and held off as long as he still looked viable. It was only when Yeltsin’s fall became imminent, and a hardening of East-West relations started to seem inevitable, that the United States moved to expand the alliance."

Ginsberg noticed that there was one obvious, potentially powerful set of actors who had largely been ignored: presidents’ closest friends. These are the men and women who can relieve the loneliness a president lives with, help him think through what to do about a major problem, and say things to him that no one else can. The resulting book is an entertaining, sometimes thought-provoking read. It opens with the well-known, highly political 50-year friendship between Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, during which they exchanged around 1,250 letters. There is Abraham Lincoln’s friendship with Joshua Speed, who may have saved Lincoln’s life from severe depression and probably did save his career. At another extreme are those friends whose main role was to listen: Daisy Suckley to Franklin Roosevelt and Bebe Rebozo to Richard Nixon. The latter two ate, drank, and relaxed together, “rarely if ever talked politics, . . . and often spent large chunks of time in silence”—but Rebozo proved there was nothing he wouldn’t do for Nixon. John F. Kennedy had already shared a close friendship with the British diplomat David Ormsby-Gore for 25 years when he momentously called on Ormsby-Gore to help figure out what to do at the peak of the Cuban missile crisis."

51,Power and Liberty: Constitutionalism in the American Revolution,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/power-and-liberty-constitutionalism-american-revolution,Power and Liberty: Constitutionalism in the American Revolution,"Many historians view Wood as the greatest living scholar of the American Revolution. This book distills the core insights of a long career into a single small volume that grabs the reader’s interest from the first page and never lets go. He explores the debates that shaped the United States’ future governance, the invention of the radical concept of popular sovereignty, and the forming of the country’s founding documents. Lacking a common ancestry, Wood writes, “Americans have had to create their sense of nationhood out of the[se] documents.” The book covers power, liberty, concepts of representation and rights, slavery, and the emergence of a judicial branch with arguably more power to shape lives than any other judiciary in the world. It is no discussion of abstract principles. Wood shows how the Revolution “released pent-up social forces in the North that turned northern society into a middle-class world,” thereby pushing the nation toward modernity. Tiny Rhode Island’s success in using paper money led to such an explosion in its use that by the time the federal government began to regulate the money supply, there were, incredibly, “more than ten thousand different kinds of notes circulating in the United States.” The relevance of the founding documents to today’s disputes is evident throughout."
52,The New Cold War,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2021-10-19/new-cold-war,The New Cold War,"Is the world entering a new cold war? Our answer is yes and no. Yes if we mean a protracted international rivalry, for cold wars in this sense are as old as history itself. Some became hot, some didn’t: no law guarantees either outcome. No if we mean the Cold War, which we capitalize because it originated and popularized the term. That struggle took place at a particular time (from 1945–47 to 1989–91), among particular adversaries (the United States, the Soviet Union, and their respective allies), and over particular issues (post–World War II power balances, ideological clashes, arms races). None of those issues looms as large now, and where parallels do exist—growing bipolarity, intensifying polemics, sharpening distinctions between autocracies and democracies—the context is quite different."
53,Order Before Peace,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/middle-east/2021-10-13/henry-kissinger-middle-east-peace,Order Before Peace,"The ignominious end to the U.S. war in Afghanistan dramatically underscored the complexity and volatility of the broader Middle East. Americans may try to console themselves that at last they can turn their backs on this troubled region since the United States is now energy self-sufficient and thus much less dependent on Middle Eastern oil. Washington has learned the hard way not to attempt to remake the region in the United States’ image. And if American leaders are tempted to make war there again, they are likely to find little public support."
54,An Ugly Truth: Inside Facebook’s Battle for Domination,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-10-19/ugly-truth-inside-facebooks-battle-domination,An Ugly Truth: Inside Facebook’s Battle for Domination,"With an impeccably sourced, highly readable volume based on interviews with hundreds of current and former Facebook employees, investors, and advisers, as well as more than 100 lawmakers, regulators, academics, and consumer advocates, and on access to previously undisclosed documents from inside the company, two New York Times reporters have produced an important addition to the voluminous literature on Facebook that should be read widely by policymakers and the public alike. The title comes from a 2016 memo to Facebook employees in which an executive in the CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s inner circle explains: “The ugly truth is that we believe in connecting people so deeply that anything that allows us to connect more people more often is de facto good.” If someone uses the platform for evil, the memo says, that’s unfortunate, but “still, we connect people.” What this has meant in practice is that Facebook has prioritized revenue growth above all else. The company’s conversion of users into unwitting sales agents by tracking their shopping activity off the site, Russia’s interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election partly through use of the site, Facebook’s development of algorithms that privilege fake news and result in news feeds that lead users down rabbit holes of misinformation—these scandals and more follow an infuriating pattern. First come efforts to suppress the bad news internally. When that fails, Facebook offers a weak public apology, which is followed by an ineffectual response from Congress or the Federal Trade Commission and then a rise in the stock price. Even a record $5 billion fine went unnoticed by the market. Facebook’s sheer size, its huge cash reserves, its aggressive legal, public relations, and lobbying teams, and regulators’ lack of understanding of what happens “behind the platform” have so far prevented effective action to rein in the company’s damaging impacts on personal privacy and the integrity of democratic societies. The authors aren’t hopeful this will come soon, but this book could help."
55,America’s Crypto Conundrum,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/americas-crypto-currency-conundrum,America’s Crypto Conundrum,"This is the year that digital currencies went mainstream. In the span of just three months last spring, China tested its first-ever digital currency in some of its largest cities, hackers breached a major U.S. oil pipeline and successfully demanded a ransom of more than $4 million in Bitcoin, cryptocurrencies surged to a record combined market capitalization of over $2 trillion, and Jerome Powell, the chair of the U.S. Federal Reserve, warned that cryptocurrencies are “highly volatile” and “may carry potential risks to . . . users and to the broader financial system.”"
56,The Technopolar Moment,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/world/2021-10-19/ian-bremmer-big-tech-global-order,The Technopolar Moment,"After rioters stormed the U.S. Capitol on January 6, some of the United States’ most powerful institutions sprang into action to punish the leaders of the failed insurrection. But they weren’t the ones you might expect. Facebook and Twitter suspended the accounts of President Donald Trump for posts praising the rioters. Amazon, Apple, and Google effectively banished Parler, an alternative to Twitter that Trump’s supporters had used to encourage and coordinate the attack, by blocking its access to Web-hosting services and app stores. Major financial service apps, such as PayPal and Stripe, stopped processing payments for the Trump campaign and for accounts that had funded travel expenses to Washington, D.C., for Trump’s supporters."
57,The Imperial Presidency’s Enablers,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/review-essay/2021-10-19/imperial-presidencys-enablers,The Imperial Presidency’s Enablers,"In 1866, the U.S. Supreme Court handed down its landmark decision in Ex parte Milligan, which barred the federal government from trying civilians in ad hoc military tribunals when civilian courts were available. Writing for the majority, Justice David Davis spent several pages explaining the dangers of an unchecked executive. The United States, he said, “has no right to expect that it will always have wise and humane rulers, sincerely attached to the principles of the Constitution.” Instead, “wicked men, ambitious of power, with hatred of liberty and contempt of law, may fill the place once occupied by Washington and Lincoln.” That is why the United States has a written constitution, he concluded, and independent judges to enforce it—even, as in the case of Milligan, against President Abraham Lincoln himself."
58,The International Order Isn’t Ready for the Climate Crisis,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/world/2021-10-19/climate-crisis-international-order-isnt-ready,The International Order Isn’t Ready for the Climate Crisis,"The planet is in the throes of an environmental emergency. Humanity’s continued addiction to fossil fuels and its voracious appetite for natural resources have led to runaway climate change, degraded vital ecosystems, and ushered in the slow death of the world’s oceans. Earth’s biosphere is breaking down. Our depredation of the planet has jeopardized our own survival."
59,The Divided World,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/issue-packages/2021-10-19/divided-world,America’s Cold Wars,"In September, in his first address to the UN General Assembly as president, Joe Biden pledged that the United States was not “seeking a new cold war or a world divided into rigid blocs.” That pledge was echoed, in different words, by Biden’s Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, and reinforced by warnings from a slew of other leaders about the grim consequences of a world split into warring camps. Yet rather than offering reassurance, this chorus served mostly to highlight just how dismal the geopolitical reality has become, with suspicion and acrimony threatening to sink trust and cooperation even in the face of shared existential challenges."
60,Power to the People?,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/world/2021-10-19/power-people,Power to the People?,"We appreciated Pippa Norris’s generous review of our book Backsliding (“Voters Against Democracy,” May/June 2021). Unfortunately, however, it misses not only important aspects of our argument but also key dimensions of the very concept of backsliding."
61,The Myth of Russian Decline,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/ukraine/2021-10-19/myth-russian-decline,The Myth of Russian Decline,"The Biden administration came into office with a clear and unambiguous foreign policy priority: countering a rising China. The administration’s public statements, its early national security planning documents, and its initial diplomatic forays have all suggested that pushing back against Beijing’s growing global influence will be Washington’s national security focus, alongside transnational threats such as climate change and the COVID-19 pandemic. The question of how to deal with Russia, by contrast, has taken a back seat, returning to the fore only when Russian troops amassed on Ukraine’s border in April. That crisis served as a reminder of the danger of looking past Moscow—yet by July, President Joe Biden was back to declaring that Russia was “sitting on top of an economy that has nuclear weapons and oil wells and nothing else.”"
62,Market Prophets,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/review-essay/2021-10-19/market-prophets,Market Prophets,"After taking office in the depths of the Great Depression, U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt quickly upended the relationship between the government and the economy. With the New Deal, Washington took the unprecedented step of creating new industries and millions of jobs. This spending rescued countless Americans from poverty and ultimately fueled the remarkable postwar economic boom. By the 1980s, however, a new bipartisan consensus had taken hold, one that saw small government and low taxes as the key to economic prosperity. In 1941, Roosevelt declared that every American deserved “freedom from want” and that it was the government’s responsibility to lead the way. But by 1996, President Bill Clinton was promising that “the era of big government is over.” What changed?"
63,The Last Days of Intervention,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/afghanistan/2021-10-08/last-days-intervention,The Last Days of Intervention,"The extravagant lurches of the U.S. intervention in Afghanistan—from a $1 trillion surge to total withdrawal, culminating in the reestablishment of a Taliban government 20 years after the 9/11 attacks—must rank among the most surreal and disturbing episodes in modern foreign policy. At the heart of the tragedy was an obsession with universal plans and extensive resources, which stymied the modest but meaningful progress that could have been achieved with far fewer troops and at a lower cost. Yet this failure to chart a middle path between ruinous overinvestment and complete neglect says less about what was possible in Afghanistan than it does about the fantasies of those who intervened there."
64,The Coming Democratic Revival,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/world/2021-10-19/madeleine-albright-coming-democratic-revival,The Coming Democratic Revival,"For two centuries, American leaders have quarreled about how high to place support for democracy on the list of U.S. foreign policy priorities. The Biden administration’s recent tragedy-marred withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan reinforced the view of skeptics from across the domestic political spectrum that actively promoting democracy overseas is naive and less likely to advance the country’s core interests than to embroil it in no-win quagmires. They point as well to a steady decline in global freedom over the past 15 years as evidence that emphasizing democratic values is out of touch with prevailing trends and therefore a losing strategy, one that actually detracts from the country’s international standing. With the United States confronted by partisan divisions at home and fierce adversaries abroad, these critics assert that U.S. leaders can no longer afford to indulge in Lincolnesque fantasies about democracy as the last best hope on earth. They must instead shift their focus inward and accept the world as it is."
65,Containment Beyond the Cold War,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/russia-fsu/2021-10-19/containment-beyond-cold-war,Containment Beyond the Cold War,"On December 15, 1991, U.S. Secretary of State James Baker arrived in Moscow amid political chaos to meet with Russian leader Boris Yeltsin, who was at the time busy wresting power from his nemesis, Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev. Yeltsin had recently made a shocking announcement that he and the leaders of Belarus and Ukraine were dismantling the Soviet Union. Their motive was to render Gorbachev impotent by transforming him from the head of a massive country into the president of nothing."
66,Taiwan and the Fight for Democracy,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/taiwan/2021-10-05/taiwan-and-fight-democracy,Taiwan and the Fight for Democracy,"The story of Taiwan is one of resilience—of a country upholding democratic, progressive values while facing a constant challenge to its existence. Our success is a testament to what a determined practitioner of democracy, characterized by good governance and transparency, can achieve."
67,The Age of America First,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2021-09-29/biden-trump-age-america-first,The Age of America First,"Donald Trump was supposed to be an aberration—a U.S. president whose foreign policy marked a sharp but temporary break from an internationalism that had defined seven decades of U.S. interactions with the world. He saw little value in alliances and spurned multilateral institutions. He eagerly withdrew from existing international agreements, such as the Paris climate accord and the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, and backed away from new ones, such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). He coddled autocrats and trained his ire on the United States’ democratic partners."
68,The Kremlin’s Strange Victory,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2021-09-27/kremlins-strange-victory,The Kremlin’s Strange Victory,"Donald Trump wanted his July 2018 meeting in Helsinki with his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, to evoke memories of the momentous encounters that took place in the 1980s between U.S. President Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. Those arms control summits had yielded the kind of iconic imagery that Trump loved: strong, serious men meeting in distant places to hash out the great issues of the day. What better way, in Trump’s view, to showcase his prowess at the art of the deal?"

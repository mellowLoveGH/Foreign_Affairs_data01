These two very different books inform readers about the political implications of water—and of its absence. Jacobs’ book focuses on the international cooperation that has developed around the management of two major river systems in Africa, the Nile River basin and the Orange River basin. She finds that an array of international conventions and conferences have allowed a set of norms to be progressively internalized by most of the states involved, despite a great deal of variation in the ability and willingness that those states bring to the task of managing shared water resources. Jacobs is thus reasonably optimistic about the role of such resources in encouraging international stability on the continent. She grants perhaps too much space to academic theories that will not interest the general reader, but her empirical materials are rich, and the book provides a good introduction to the international dimension of these issues."

A natural aptitude for mathematics, fostered by Benin’s surprisingly good rural primary schools, obviously helped Wantchékon. Young Léonard also appears to have benefited from a large number of relatives, friends, and mentors who believed in his talents and were willing to help him. His memoir’s most evocative sections deal with his career as a left-wing pro-democracy activist at the University of Benin in the late 1970s, which made him a celebrity in student circles and a target of the military regime of President Mathieu Kérékou. Wantchékon captures well the disillusionment of a generation of his compatriots as the promise of independence was overwhelmed by economic crisis and political repression. After being arrested, tortured, and imprisoned in northern Benin, Wantchékon managed to escape to Nigeria, then immigrated as a political refugee to Canada, where he discovered economics and began his ascent in North American academia. Disarmingly candid and generous to friend and foe alike, this book will leave readers with a smile. Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."
2,Interventions: A Life in War and Peace,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2013-02-18/interventions-life-war-and-peace,Interventions: A Life in War and Peace,"Annan devotes much of his memoir to the problems of international peacekeeping, which were central to his career, first as assistant secretary-general of the United Nations for peacekeeping operations, from 1993 to 1994, and later as UN secretary-general, from 1997 to 2006. In recounting some of the major conflicts of the recent past, his book provides a sensible, often humane defense of the critical importance of multilateral diplomacy. Recounting the UN’s checkered role in troubled places, such as Somalia in the early 1990s, Rwanda in 1994, and Darfur in the early years of this century, he laments that a lack of resources and power prevents the UN from securing peace. Annan views the Western powers, and the United States in particular, as the primary culprits for this state of affairs. He repeatedly implies that greater resources would have allowed the UN to achieve its objectives, although he does not specify exactly what the organization would have done differently. A wide variety of powerful figures who do not share his vision come in for frank criticism, from John Bolton, the U.S. ambassador to the un during the George W. Bush administration, to Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir. Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

Ellis’ research suggests that the South African Communist Party enjoyed a higher degree of influence on the ANC's decision-making than has been acknowledged by the ANC's leadership. The link between the two organizations was inconvenient to ANC leaders, who denied it, not only because it risked undermining support in the West for the struggle against apartheid but also because they feared that the mostly white leadership of the Communist Party would weaken the ANC's nationalist and anticolonial credentials among black Africans. The book also describes intense factional disputes within the exiled leadership, the tendency toward secrecy and fragmentation that the pressures of the struggle imposed and distance reinforced, and the corruption and repressive practices that inevitably resulted. Ellis recognizes that the ANC forged itself into an effective organization over time but insists that many of the flaws that have emerged since it came to power are the results of characteristics that were deeply ingrained during its period of exile.

4,Three Books on the Rise of China,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2013-02-18/three-books-rise-china,Three Books on the Rise of China,"These works concur in their skeptical assessments of the threat posed to the United States by China, but their reasoning is different. Luttwak invokes what he calls “the logic of strategy,” which “applies in perfect equality to every culture in every age.” Since aggrandizement generates resistance, he argues, China’s economic and military rise is producing a seemingly paradoxical decline in its diplomatic influence. Behind a screen of anodyne communiqués and innocuous military meetings, he decodes evidence that China’s neighbors are tightening their cooperation with the United States. This should send a message of caution to Beijing, but like all major powers, China is afflicted with what Luttwak tartly labels “great-state autism,” which leads it to respond with more assertiveness, only accelerating the formation of the coalition against it. Luttwak believes that frictions might decrease, although not disappear, if China were to democratize. Meanwhile, he hints that China’s rivals should take measures to slow China’s rate of economic growth, although he is not clear about what those measures should be."
5,Sources of Vietnamese Tradition,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2013-02-18/sources-vietnamese-tradition,Sources of Vietnamese Tradition,"This addition to the venerable Introduction to Asian Civilizations series marks a major step in the maturation of Vietnam studies in the American academy. The book translates excerpts from more than 200 texts, many previously unavailable in Western languages, dating from the year 297 to 1991. Throughout their long history, people in the lowlands of Vietnam struggled to protect themselves against military incursions and cultural influences from minority peoples in the surrounding highlands and from Cambodia, China, Thailand, and, eventually, Europe. Many themes in this collection resemble those encountered in the Sources of Tradition volumes on China, Japan, and Korea. The imperial bureaucracy tried to control local society, Buddhism contended with Confucianism and eventually with Christianity and Marxism, women conformed to and resisted prescribed gender roles, nationalists debated how to resist Western incursions, and the South fought repeatedly with the North. The Vietnamese gradually forged a distinct civilization and a proud identity. The book lays a solid foundation for further teaching and research in many disciplines.

A “Korean wind” swept northeastern China in the late 1990s as ethnic Korean female residents of that region left seeking to marry rural bachelors in South Korea. Seoul promoted the import of ethnic Korean brides from China instead of Vietnamese women or Filipinas because it believed Korean national identity would be threatened by racial mixing. This sensitive, revealing ethnographic study explores how matches hastily arranged during “marriage tours” to China came under strain when the brides arrived in their new homes. The husbands wanted their wives to adhere to traditional female norms that were no longer in vogue in China; the wives expected prosperity but found themselves laboring in the fields or in seafood-processing plants and caring for their new in-laws. In trying to maintain “racial purity” without inviting a flood of outside Koreans, the South Korean government created bureaucratic barriers to the very flow of brides it was trying to promote, which led to the forged claims of kinship alluded to in the book’s title and other attempts to game the system.

But lifetime employment rested on a substructure of gender discrimination. Corporations could require long, flexible hours from male employees as long as wives stayed home, and they could adjust their labor needs around the edges by hiring and firing women when necessary. But beginning in the late 1990s, neoliberal reforms reduced the number of lifetime jobs without leading to corresponding improvements in social protections. The result was harder work conditions for both regular and irregular workers and growing income inequality, unemployment, and poverty. Miura traces the problem to the ideological hostility of conservative political elites to gender equality and social rights. Despite a growing awareness of the problem in the country, she sees little prospect for change, because the coalition comprised of corporations and protected workers has more clout than the growing cadre of the disadvantaged.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

But in China, these facts remain officially taboo. For Yang, a journalist and one-time believer in Mao’s utopian vision, discovering the truth was a personal quest. This long book is an abridgement of an even longer work in Chinese that Yang intended as a memorial for his father and other victims. He fills it with hundreds of names of victims that he discovered in local archives during years of travel and research and with the stories of how they died. His painful account reveals the cruelties ordinary people are capable of when they are pitted against one another for survival. Yang discovers that among famished Chinese in extremis, cannibalism was more widespread than previously known. He also demonstrates Mao’s direct responsibility for the disaster; the slavish refusal of Mao’s chief aide, Zhou Enlai, to challenge Mao; and the complicity of local officials who launched misconceived construction projects that exacerbated the grain shortage by taking peasants away from farm work.

In their view, it enjoys political legitimacy internally and is faithful to its constitution and accountable to its people. It is also the main impediment to the United States’ hegemonic dominance in the region. Iran’s nuclear program aims to force the United States to deal with it on an even footing. The Islamic Republic has sought a grand bargain but has been repeatedly rebuffed by Washington, which is intent on regime change. The Leveretts conclude that the United States needs a “Nixonian moment,” in which Washington would seek strategic accommodation with Tehran, as it did with Beijing. The argument has merit, but the authors overargue it, straining the reader’s credulity. To the Leveretts, the Iranian regime and its supreme leader are models of good political practice. They report unblinkingly that the establishment of the Islamic Republic was approved by 98 percent of voters in a 1979 referendum. They dismiss as groundless the allegations of fraud in Iran’s 2009 presidential election. They insist that Iran’s regional posture is purely defensive. Most telling, the Leveretts’ list of those who get Iran wrong, from neoconservatives to liberal internationalists, leaves out almost no one except themselves.

10,Israel’s Security and Its Arab Citizens,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2013-02-18/israels-security-and-its-arab-citizens,Israel’s Security and Its Arab Citizens,"Frisch usefully brings international relations theory to bear on the question of Israel’s policies toward its Arab citizens. His conclusions are hardly surprising. Israel’s strategic concerns about its Arab neighbors reflect back (negatively) on the minority Arab population within Israel. Israel’s first prime minister, David Ben-Gurion, considered the Israeli Arabs to be a fifth column; Frisch believes that some portion of the community fits that description today, as well. Any meaningful dialogue between Jewish and Arab Israelis is stymied by Jewish insistence on loyalty to the Zionist state and dismissal of the Arab view of Israel’s creation as a nakba (catastrophe) for Arabs and by Arab calls to transform Israel into a binational state. Frisch views the latter as a recipe for failure, citing the precedents of Cyprus and Lebanon. He notes an interesting tension: on the one hand, Israel’s economic liberalization and relatively liberal judiciary allow for some loosening of the screws on Israeli Arabs; on the other, the country’s “deteriorating” geostrategic position leads to their tightening. Frisch concludes that compared with minorities in other ethnonational conflicts, the Israeli Arabs do relatively well. But that will be scant comfort to members of that community.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

Ever since then, the United States, although occasionally tempted to stray from these rules, has carefully adhered to them and sometimes argued for them even more strenuously than the Israelis. The rules forbid sharing control of Jerusalem, allowing the return of Palestinian refugees driven from their homes during the Arab-Israeli wars of 1948 and 1967, and granting the Palestinians sovereignty over the occupied territories and their inhabitants. Khalidi argues that the Madrid conference of 1991, the Oslo process of the 1990s, and U.S. President Barack Obama’s peace initiative of 2009 were integral parts of a joint U.S.-Israeli strategy to buy time for the Israelis to expand their settlements in the West Bank and sever East Jerusalem from the Palestinian hinterland. Saudi Arabia could have anchored an Arab counterweight but has acquiesced to the status quo out of concern for its own security. Khalidi’s book is as despairing as it is short; he sees no way out."

Fournier, an anthropologist, spent the turbulent year of Ukraine’s 2004 Orange Revolution observing and interacting with teenagers and their teachers in two Kiev high schools, one public and one private. Depending on how much weight one places on the voices of 182 students and 43 teachers and administrators, the impression one gets is of a generation of young people with ideas that are inchoate and rather jaundiced, but at some level hopeful, in the hands of many teachers who miss the docile classrooms of the Soviet era and whose pedagogy favors rote memorization over the encouragement of independent thinking. If these young people manifest a pubescent cynicism, a sense of voicelessness in their education, and a personal style mimicking the gangster element in contemporary Ukrainian culture, it just might have something to do with the society in which they live.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

The Isaac of the title is Isaac Zuckerman, the young Polish-Lithuanian Zionist who willed into existence the Jewish Fighting Organization (ZOB). Although little more than a small band of lightly armed conspirators, in April 1943, the ZOB trapped in fiery carnage the German SS units dispatched to carry out murderous deportations of the Jews. That assault and the supporting role the ZOB played in the 1944 Warsaw Uprising were the most dramatic moments of the five harrowing years the group spent fighting the Germans. Brzezinski narrates the group’s feats in pulsating detail by following every step of a half-dozen principal members. Zuckerman died in Israel in 1981, having successfully arranged the passage to Palestine of 115,000 Polish Jews in the late 1940s despite British immigration obstacles—with Stalin’s apparent assistance, ironically enough.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

They center on the activities of a group of ten Russian spies in the United States whose discovery in 2010 created a media sensation. The tabloids were especially keen on Anna Chapman, a comely redhead who emerged as a pop-culture sex icon after she returned to Russia, along with the rest of the group, as part of a spy swap. Lucas also tells the more dramatic but less sensationalized tale of Herman Simm, an Estonian ex-policeman who later became the keeper of Estonia’s top military secrets—and a Russian agent, until he was arrested by Estonian authorities in 2008. Simm prospered less in his post-spying career than Chapman did; he was convicted of treason and wound up in a Tartu prison. Lucas plugs this material, together with an interesting chapter on contemporary spycraft, into a fevered portrait of Vladimir Putin’s Russia as a state thoroughly controlled by the successor agencies of the KGB, which are hell-bent on “rigging” the decision-making of U.S. and European policymakers, disrupting their alliances, and murdering the Russian regime’s opponents.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

Those were among the privileges enjoyed by the Sheremetev family, who consorted with the tsars and could trace their ancestry back to the boyars of the sixteenth century. They were at the top of the 100 families of the Russian nobility, the 1.5 percent of the population that dominated society. Smith, with a sure hand and graceful prose, traces what happened to them and to another illustrious family, the Golitsyns, during and after the 1917 revolution. Their fates were more complex than one might imagine. Nearly all perished, but in different times and circumstances. Some fell victim to the chaos and violence of the early years of Bolshevik rule. Others survived until the late 1920s but were shunted into cramped corners of their former mansions and reduced to menial labor. Still others were eliminated in Stalin’s Great Purge of 1937–38. A very few lived out their lives in Paris, Southern California, or the post-Stalin Soviet Union. “Former people” was the official label applied to Russia’s decimated nobility. Smith re-creates what they experienced with an intimacy that brings the whole history of these years vividly and grotesquely alive.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

For more than a millennium, a territory smaller than the U.S. state of the same name suffered a dizzying swirl of invasions as Cimmerians, Scythians, Greeks, Seleucids, Romans, Seljuks, Persians, Ottomans, and Russians battled for some or all of its land. These struggles with outsiders began centuries before the birth of Jesus and continued through the Russian war with Georgia in August 2008, and they were accentuated by near-constant warring among the separate dynasties that ruled Georgia’s different regions during the long periods when the country was not united. Rayfield reconstructs every step of the way in often punishing detail. The onslaught eases and the reading becomes more rewarding when he gets to Georgia’s “Golden Age” (1089–1213), under the reigns of David IV and Queen Tamara. His treatment of the turbulent eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, when the violent dance among the Ottomans, the Persians, and the Russians ended with Georgia’s incorporation into the Russian empire, is particularly masterful.

The way capital and coercion intersect constitutes the core of Easter’s explanation for why and how some postcommunist countries emerged with a “contractual” state and others with a “predatory” one. The first type, exemplified by Poland, checks the power of political leaders, disciplines the state’s use of coercion, protects private property, and diversifies wealth. The other type, illustrated by Russia, unfetters the arbitrary power of political leaders, indulges their use of coercion, blurs the line between public and private, and plays fast and loose with wealth and property. Whether a state follows the path to one type or the other depends heavily on the outcome of battles over taxation, Easter contends in this lucid, well-argued book. Tracing the complex interplay among politicians, bureaucrats, corporate interests, and labor in the struggle to shape the state’s capacity to finance itself is no simple task, and Easter does it deftly.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

Despite the diversity of contexts among the seven cases explored, a similar dynamic appears in all of them: a history of political exclusion motivated armed actors and fueled wars that, in turn, limited the ability of the government to deliver basic services and weakened state institutions; this weakness hobbled postwar democratization processes intended to ameliorate the political exclusion that was so often at the root of the original violence. Corruption and a lack of basic security undermined public faith in democratic institutions, allowing for the rise of leaders with authoritarian tendencies. State-building projects promoted by international actors, such as truth-and-reconciliation commissions to address human rights abuses, have produced mixed results. By detailing the structural factors that have affected the prospects for democracy in these war-torn states, this book should be of keen interest to observers of postwar societies and democratization both within Latin America and beyond.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

Popular music was his escape from crime and discrimination, often at the hands of black Americans. Jean’s hybrid musical style mixes Caribbean rhythms, gospel sermons, jazz, rock, and hip-hop but avoids glorifying “gangsta” violence. In his memoir, ’Clef (as he calls himself) comes off as energetic, entrepreneurial, brash, cocky, and self-promoting, repeatedly admitting moral missteps, as though his confessions absolve him of his sins. In many ways, the book is a get-even shot at his former lover and musical collaborator Lauryn Hill, who related her thoughts about their relationship on her acclaimed 1998 album, The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. Jean fleetingly ran for president of Haiti but now supports his fellow musician Michel Martelly, the current president. Perhaps artistic license accounts for the contradictory statements that appear on page after page of Jean’s book, such as his concession that there was some mismanagement of the now-shuttered charity fund he established to benefit Haiti, an admission followed by his confusing assertion that “the media didn’t find anything wrong with our tax situation” even though “we were behind on our payments for a few years.”Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

There is no single takeaway, but the thoughtful commentaries collected here note a number of opportunities to be seized and potential dangers to be averted. Striking an optimistic note, Enrique Dussel Peters imagines collaboration between China and Mexico in manufacturing hybrid and electric vehicles for sale throughout North America. Adrian Hearn draws attention to the Chinese diaspora living in Cuba and Mexico, speculating that its members could help broker transpacific cooperation. Particularly interesting is Ruben Gonzalez-Vicente’s mapping of Chinese mining investments in Ecuador and Peru, where, rather than being the instruments of orchestrated Chinese diplomacy, Chinese firms are pursuing their individual commercial interests. Other essays examine Chinese perceptions of Latin America. Official Chinese state rhetoric praises Latin American progress, but some Chinese persist in viewing Latin America in utterly negative terms. Chinese “leftists” continue to romanticize the egalitarianism of Che Guevara, just as Chinese “globalists” criticize contemporary Cuba for the slow pace of its economic reforms.

The United States’ get-tough, penalty-based law enforcement approach fails for the obvious reason that repressing the market for drugs only raises prices and profits for criminal cartels. Carpenter rejects the hysteria that often accompanies this topic. Although worried by recent trends, he is not persuaded that Mexico is a “failed state” or that there has been a significant spillover of drug-related violence from Mexico into the United States. Unwaveringly clear-eyed, Carpenter dismisses “bogus solutions,” such as programs to reduce the demand for drugs in the United States, efforts to stem arms trafficking to Mexico, or plans to seal the border, as not realistic or beside the point. He wants the U.S. government to deprive the cartels of revenue by legalizing the manufacture, sale, and possession of illegal drugs, steps that would conserve law enforcement resources and also generate significant revenue for the government."

Mayer suggests a middle path, arguing that European governments must avoid unlimited commitments to fiscal transfers and centralized control in favor of limited cooperation to construct a minimal regulatory framework. The European Union should move toward creating a banking union, he argues, in which the European Central Bank would increase its role in banking supervision and act as a lender of last resort to banks troubled by liquidity problems. Yet the EU cannot and should not handle its member states‚ fundamental solvency issues, particularly their sovereign debts, not only because the EU lacks a democratic mandate but also because this would undermine the European Central Bank's proper goal of price stability. One implication of Mayer's argument is that the eurozone is likely to shrink and some national currencies will likely reemerge in Europe. In Germany, with its emphasis on financial rectitude and price stability, this view is widely held, although mostly behind closed doors. Given Berlin's key role in European monetary decision-making, this vision is probably more realistic than other, more widely discussed scenarios.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

The EU is more than a classic international organization subordinate to its member states, yet less than a state with a monopoly of coercive force and a cohesive political identity. Many believe that Europeans are thereby saddled with a perpetual democratic deficit. Habermas disagrees, arguing that the EU permits its member states to better govern their societies in the face of globalization, thereby expanding, rather than shrinking, genuine democratic control. This works as long as its members share common democratic values and as long as the right to final legal adjudication lies with national, rather than EU, constitutional courts. This is a surprisingly conservative vision. On the question of the current euro crisis, Habermas is more radical, favoring electoral reforms that he believes would enhance participation and deliberation. Europeans might thus come to realize that a fairer distribution of the gains from monetary integration is consistent with their values and interests. Wishful thinking, perhaps; still, this slim volume is crucial for understanding how influential Europeans are reflecting on their predicament.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

The contribution this book makes is its analysis of specific movements in several dozen Europeans countries. Although the academic prose style and the authors's pursuit of personal research agendas are occasionally self-indulgent, an intriguing common theme emerges. Simply put, the extreme right seems to enjoy a position in European life that is more than the sum of its contradictory parts. European right-wing parties are in fact surprisingly fragmented, disagreeing over almost everything except ultranationalist sentiments and xenophobic opposition to non-European immigrants. The parties often change their views. They differ across countries, and labels fail to capture their beliefs. Still, although almost all of them are politically weak, they sometimes manage to force other parties to strategically adopt some of their positions. And although many of them appeal to atavistic notions of tradition, they are all quintessentially modern, skillfully exploiting the mass media to bolster their images and using the Internet to assist one another.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."
25,The Sleepwalkers: How Europe Went to War in 1914,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2013-02-18/sleepwalkers-how-europe-went-war-1914,The Sleepwalkers: How Europe Went to War in 1914,"This compelling examination of the causes of World War I deserves to become the new standard one-volume account of that contentious subject. Clark, a history professor at Cambridge University, concedes the importance of basic structural causes, such as rigid alliance commitments; the temptations of preventive war on a rapidly growing, militarized continent; and the peculiarities of authoritarian decision-making. Yet he believes that such forces alone cannot explain the war and might just as likely have led to peace. He argues that war emerged from a complex conjunction of factors, each of which was far from inevitable and in many cases even improbable, often because it involved decision-makers who behaved less than fully rationally. They indulged in illusions of power, stereotypes about their enemies, and outmoded conceptions of sovereignty; they succumbed to the demands of transient domestic coalitions; and they misperceived their surroundings, sometimes for no good reason. In all of this, such leaders were sleepwalkers,generally unaware of the horrific consequences of the war they were about to unleash. This interpretation not only captures trends in modern historiography on the Great War but also highlights striking similarities with (and a few differences from) the decision-making in contemporary conflicts.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

European states struggled to catch up, often opposing regulatory protections. Around 1990, these roles were reversed. Today, Europeans enjoy the cleanest air, water, and land; the most natural food; the safest drugs and cosmetics; and the greatest commitment to a sustainable global environment. In Vogel's words, the EU has become a global regulatory hegemon, driving corporate standards even in China and other far-flung jurisdictions. What explains this switch? In this engaging book, Vogel argues that extreme conservatives in the United States have brought regulatory innovation to a standstill, aided by decentralized and gridlocked U.S. political institutions. In Europe, by contrast, a more moderate consensus and centrist parliamentary systems maintain support for regulation, which the EU policy process tends to spread uniformly throughout the continent. This book might not be the final word on this fascinating subject, but it should be required reading for businesspeople, officials, and citizens interested in the role of government in the modern world.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

And indeed, at least one of the contributions falls prey to the temptation of complacent justification of the war leadership of Bush père at the particular expense of Bush fils more than a decade later. But the others are appropriately judicious, complex, and ambivalent. In retrospect, the war was far less the definitive and smashing success the administration claimed (and some of its former members still believe it to have been) and more a gateway to a different set of problems Saddam Hussein posed. Most college students today were not even born when the Gulf War occurred: this book is a good way of helping them think about what it meant.

They do not dwell on the usual suspects but instead examine a number of unlikely prospects, such as Indonesia, Myanmar (also called Burma), Saudi Arabia, and Vietnam, and some that were once believed to be on the verge but are no longer, such as Argentina and Brazil. Warning lights do not really flash in any of these cases, although the Middle Eastern and Asian examples do indicate the problems that could develop if the United States were perceived to be withdrawing from its established security commitments. Later chapters look at the policy options available for heading off proliferation. The 1970 Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty remains the centerpiece, but there are a variety of other means for warning would-be proliferators that they could struggle to realize their ambitions, and there are also positive inducements to persuade countries to forego nuclear arms."

They tell of individuals damaged physically, mentally, and morally by what they have experienced; the guilt they feel over fallen comrades whose deaths they were unable to mourn; families struggling to cope with the depression and desensitization of returning warriors; the apparent indifference and banal preoccupations of the broader society; and the public’s failure to respect what veterans have seen and done in the service of their country. Other complaints are also familiar: the military’s inadequate preparations for war and inability to grasp alien cultures or the motives of enemies and the lack of physical and mental health care offered to veterans on their return. Among veterans, these costs of war are reflected in widespread posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), alcohol abuse, divorce, and, all too often, suicide. These books rebuke those who wish to present war solely in noble and heroic terms. But they are not, nor do they try to be, balanced themselves: they do not tell the stories of those who have returned relatively unscathed."

It identifies a number of “megatrends” and “game-changers” before concluding with four quite different potential scenarios, thus underlining the inherent uncertainty in predicting the future. The first major trend will be an increase in individual empowerment, stemming from declines in poverty, the growth of a global middle class, and more widely available communications and other technologies, including destructive ones. Second, power among countries will become more diffuse, as emerging markets grow rapidly and many rich countries age and grow slowly. Third, demographic changes will take place slowly but inexorably, since aging in many countries will be accompanied by significant youth bulges elsewhere, urbanization, and major migrations. Finally, as populations grow and increased consumption levels strain existing resources, access to food, energy, and water will become ever more crucial and closely related. The nic declines to attach probabilities to its various scenarios, but this is nonetheless a thoughtful exercise in futurology.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

An attractive feature of this book about the financial crisis of 2008, written by the chair of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) at the time, is that it covers many official responses to the crisis that were considered but not carried out. In explaining why she preferred what happened to what did not happen, or vice versa, Bair has produced a useful, corrective addition to the already extensive literature on the crisis. Unsurprisingly, as the crisis unfolded, Bair wanted to protect the FDIC’s funds, which back its guarantees of bank deposits, and she thought that some of the government support to large financial institutions was unwarranted. Her discussion of the practicalities of saving troubled banks is highly pertinent to the debate currently taking place over a possible banking union in Europe.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

He frames his highly readable book as a series of explanatory memoranda to a hypothetical U.S. president, covering all the proposals currently on the table and some not yet there and acknowledging that his conclusions and recommendations will infuriate some segments of the public. He is impressed by the high energy density and low cost of gasoline in the United States but troubled by the fact that the country needs to import so much crude oil. He is also pleased with the rapid development of shale gas and the bright prospects for shale oil. He urges the president to focus on energy conservation, hybrid cars, synfuels (liquid fuels made from gas or coal), and smart-grid electricity distribution. He also sees potential for wind power, photovoltaics, nuclear power, grass-based biofuels, and methane-based fuel cells.

Such a tax would do so both by discouraging the use of fossil fuels, especially coal, and by encouraging the development of alternative, nonemitting sources of energy. Drawing on a large body of research on the subject, the contributors contend that such a charge on greenhouse gas emissions would be easily the most efficient measure to address climate change. It would have the additional advantage of generating revenue, which could be used for a variety of purposes: to reduce budget deficits, to lower other taxes, to finance research and development, to fund the development of nonemitting sources of energy, to cushion the impact of higher energy prices on poor people, and to help poor countries reduce their emissions and adapt to the climate change that is already under way.

35,Is China Buying the World?,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2013-02-18/china-buying-world,Is China Buying the World?,"Nolan, a British economist, answers the question in his title with a resounding no. It is true that in recent years China’s state-owned enterprises have been engaged in what is often portrayed as an orgy of acquisitions around the world, particularly in the oil and mineral industries. But the author regards China’s firms merely as latecomers to the extensive global consolidation of business enterprises over the past two decades. He helpfully documents increased global concentration in numerous industries, from brewing beer to building trucks. The national identity of many global firms has become blurred: headquarters are typically still in one place, but assets, employment, production, and sales are widely dispersed, increasingly to emerging markets. It is against this background that China’s foreign investment must be assessed. While that investment has grown rapidly in recent years and many major acquisitions have attracted public attention, in 2009 it amounted to only 1.4 percent of the total direct foreign investments made by the world’s rich countries, and two-thirds of it was directed to Hong Kong and Macao. Meanwhile, China remains largely dependent on foreign technology, and only one indigenous Chinese firm, Huawei, has so far made a global impact.

Here, a team of American and European scholars makes one of the best efforts yet to identify the norms of hegemonic and great-power responsibility by examining three “problem areas” in contemporary world politics: nonproliferation, climate change, and international financial regulation. They find that problem solving in the post–Cold War international system has been accomplished not by appeals to the sovereign equality of states nor by the outright imposition of order by dominant countries. Rather, states have sought to establish a middle ground, in which the United States and other great powers are given more say over rules and institutions but are expected, in return, to make costly commitments and shoulder disproportionate burdens. It is a classic bargain: great powers are granted the legitimacy to exercise power on the global stage, but the price is a willingness to act—at least at the margins and consistent with their self-interest—for the common good.

Negotiations over nuclear weapons reduced the risk of war and also provided a diplomatic framework for managing global affairs. In the last 20 years, however, the nuclear arms control agenda has all but disappeared, even as nuclear weapons have spread to more countries and regions. In this useful little book, Pifer and O’Hanlon call for reviving nuclear arms control, arguing that Washington should build on the 2010 New START agreement, between the United States and Russia, by ending its nuclear testing, engaging Russia on the issue of missile defense, pursuing a moratorium on the production of enriched uranium and fissile material, shrinking its stockpile of nuclear warheads, and bringing other countries, particularly China, into the nuclear arms reduction process. The book makes clear that nuclear arms control is still a core U.S. interest and must be extended beyond the United States and Russia to include newer nuclear states. In a multipolar nuclear era, multilateral arms control will be essential.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

In this collection, his essays on China are particularly penetrating. Etzioni sees China neither as a great threat to the Western-led global order nor as a reliable stakeholder in that order. China, he argues, is seeking to protect its national autonomy and pursue economic development, making it quite comfortable with Westphalian norms of sovereignty and suspicious of liberal interventionism. In the United States’ confrontations with radical Islamist regimes, Etzioni counsels restraint in the hope that moderation will prevail in the end. To address the fiscal and political dysfunctions of the Western postindustrial world, especially in Europe, Etzioni urges a return to the traditions of political solidarity and collective governance within liberal democracies. If there is an overarching theme in the book, it is that the American-led world order is not in upheaval, nor breaking apart into a multipolar system, but rather devolving into more distinct regional groupings. The United States will have less control over events, but no rival state is emerging to impose a new order.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

In this fascinating book, Naím makes the more provocative claim that power is, in fact, declining. Naím focuses on the flagging ability of large organizations—government ministries, corporations, militaries, churches, educational and philanthropic foundations—to get their way. He acknowledges that wealth is now more concentrated than ever in the hands of elites and the institutions they control. But he argues that the ability of elites to use their assets to influence and shape the world has dissipated. This much is convincing, but the argument that power itself is slipping away or disappearing is less so. What Naím shows, rather, is that power now manifests itself in new ways and places. New technologies and novel social groupings have allowed inventors, activists, terrorists, and many other types of people to exercise more influence. Naím might overstate the significance of this change, but his book should provoke a debate about how to govern the world when more and more people are in charge.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

In this eloquent and searching portrait of today’s transforming global order, he is more optimistic, arguing that the world is only a few steps away from a global governance system that will unite regions, civilizations, and great powers. Behind this “great convergence” is the transformative power of economic modernization and the birth of a global middle class. In Asia alone, 500 million people have recently emerged from poverty, and that number will swell to roughly 1.75 billion by the end of the decade. What Mahbubani finds striking is the consistency of middle-class values and aspirations in disparate settings: most of the world’s people live outside of the West, but they increasingly want the same things and embrace the same ideals as people in the West. As Mahbubani might admit, the weak link in this optimist narrative is the actual hard work of diplomacy and the uncertain ability of states to act in their enlightened self-interest."

In July 1944, in the midst of World War II, representatives of 44 nations gathered in this remote New Hampshire town to create something that had never before existed: a global monetary system to be managed by an international body. The gold standard of the late nineteenth century, the organically formed foundation of the first great economic globalization, had collapsed during the previous world war. Efforts to revive it in the 1920s proved catastrophically unsuccessful. Economies and trade collapsed; cross-border tensions soared. In the 1930s, internationalists in the U.S. Treasury Department saw a powerful cause and effect and were determined to resolve the flaws in the international economic system once and for all.

In the second half of the twentieth century, it was the backbone of U.S. national security. Its purpose, logic, and effectiveness were well understood.

For decades, the United States has sought to change Pakistan's strategic focus from competing with India and seeking more influence in Afghanistan to protecting its own internal stability and economic development.

46,Capitalism and Inequality,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2013-02-11/capitalism-and-inequality,Capitalism and Inequality,"Recent political debate in the United States and other advanced capitalist democracies has been dominated by two issues: the rise of economic inequality and the scale of government intervention to address it. As the 2012 U.S. presidential election and the battles over the ""fiscal cliff"" have demonstrated, the central focus of the left today is on increasing government taxing and spending, primarily to reverse the growing stratification of society, whereas the central focus of the right is on decreasing taxing and spending, primarily to ensure economic dynamism. Each side minimizes the concerns of the other, and each seems to believe that its desired policies are sufficient to ensure prosperity and social stability. Both are wrong."

The Obama administration's renewed focus on the strategic significance of Asia has been entirely appropriate. Without such a move, there was a danger that China, with its hard-line, realist view of international relations, would conclude that an economically exhausted United States was losing its staying power in the Pacific. But now that it is clear that the United States will remain in Asia for the long haul, the time has come for both Washington and Beijing to take stock, look ahead, and reach some long-term conclusions as to what sort of world they want to see beyond the barricades."

There is certainly much that is alien about the world of Robert Stewart, better known as Lord Castlereagh (1769-1822), who helped usher in a new European order as British foreign secretary during and after the Napoleonic Wars. Nowadays, for example, one would not expect two senior politicians from the same party, both cabinet ministers, to fight a duel in the middle of a war, as Castlereagh and then Foreign Secretary George Canning did in 1809. And of course, there were some more fundamental differences: the British government of Castlereagh's day was elected by a narrow, all-male franchise determined by property ownership, and King George III, in his saner moments, was no mere constitutional figurehead but a power in his own right. Outside Great Britain, continental Europe would seem stranger still, with systems ranging from the Napoleonic tyranny in France to absolute monarchies in Austria, Prussia, and Russia.

But nothing could be further from the truth. Throughout most of our species' long and bloody slog, warfare has primarily been carried out by bands of loosely organized, ill-disciplined, and lightly armed volunteers who disdained open battle in favor of stealthy raids and ambushes: the strategies of both tribal warriors and modern guerrillas and terrorists. In fact, conventional warfare is the relatively recent invention. It was first made possible after 10,000 BC by the development of agricultural societies, which produced enough surplus wealth and population to allow for the creation of specially designed fortifications and weapons (and the professionals to operate them). The first genuine armies -- commanded by a strict hierarchy, composed of trained soldiers, disciplined with threats of punishment -- arose after 3100 BC in Egypt and Mesopotamia. But the process of state formation and, with it, army formation took considerably longer in most of the world. In some places, states emerged only in the past century, and their ability to carry out such basic functions as maintaining an army remains tenuous at best. Considering how long humans have been roaming the earth, the era of what we now think of as conventional conflict represents the mere blink of an eye."

Prominent Mexican news organizations and analysts have estimated that during the six-year term of Mexico's last president, Felipe Calderón, over 60,000 people were killed in drug-related violence, and some researchers have put the number at tens of thousands more.

The animating principle of the trials was that conduct of extreme inhumanity violated the part of international law that protects fundamental human rights, which applies everywhere, even though the conduct was authorized by German law under the Third Reich. Since then, the world has accepted that the worst human rights abuses -- including genocide, slavery, torture, and war crimes -- are crimes prohibited by international law, even if they are expressly permitted by the laws of the state in which they occur."

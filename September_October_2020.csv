0,A Grand Strategy of Resilience,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2020-08-11/grand-strategy-resilience,A Grand Strategy of Resilience,"Every so often in the history of the United States, there are moments of political realignment—times when the consensus that defined an era collapses and a new paradigm emerges. The liberal era ushered in by President Franklin Roosevelt defined U.S. politics for a generation. So did the neoliberal wave that followed in the 1980s. Today, that era, too, is coming to a close, its demise hastened by the election of President Donald Trump and the chaos of the coronavirus pandemic."
1,The Fragile Republic,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2020-08-07/democracy-fragile-republic,The Fragile Republic,"When the U.S. president used his power to target immigrants, the press, and his political opponents, the sheer overreach of his actions shocked many citizens. Tensions among the country’s political leaders had been escalating for years. Embroiled in one intense conflict after another, both sides had grown increasingly distrustful of each other. Every action by one camp provoked a greater counterreaction from the other, sometimes straining the limits of the Constitution. Fights and mob violence often followed."
2,Messiah Complex,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/brazil/2020-08-11/jair-bolsonaro-messiah-complex,Messiah Complex,"Brazil has a face that it tends to present to the world: a country of glittering beaches and hillside favelas, of Oscar Niemeyer’s delightful churches and museums, of João Gilberto crooning “The Girl From Ipanema.” This is the Brazil of Rio de Janeiro, which is also, not coincidentally, the city that hosts global events, such as the Olympics, and that serves as a base for most foreign correspondents. This Brazil is troubled but romantic, a racial mosaic, violent but impossible to resist. It is a postcard, a nightmare, a dream."
3,An Answer to Aggression,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2020-08-11/ccp-answer-aggression,An Answer to Aggression,"The Chinese Communist Party’s initial mismanagement of the COVID-19 pandemic and its subsequent attempts to exploit the crisis have produced enduring problems for the rest of the world. But the CCP’s behavior has also helped clarify the threat that China poses to the security, prosperity, and well-being of other countries. Public opinion polls show that over 60 percent of Americans of both political parties now hold a negative view of Beijing’s leadership and intentions, and similar attitudes can be found across the democratic world. This heightened awareness of a shared danger creates an opportunity for the United States and its allies to formulate a new and more effective strategy for dealing with China."
4,"Democratic Struggle, Institutional Reform, and State Resilience in the African Sahel",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/democratic-struggle-institutional-reform-and-state-resilience-african-sahel,"Democratic Struggle, Institutional Reform, and State Resilience in the African Sahel","This excellent collection of studies of six Francophone countries in the Sahel region of West Africa (Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, and Senegal) examines the impact of democratization on state building since the early 1990s. The supporters of democratization assumed that it would produce more legitimate and effective central states. The process has proved partial and uneven, but all six countries did allow political oppositions to form and began to convene regular multiparty elections. The valuable case studies of Burkina Faso, Mauritania, and Niger suggest that the turn to electoral politics strengthened institutions, whereas the chapter on Mali shows how democratization led to the government’s collapse in 2011. The collection offers no easy generalizations to explain this variation but draws out the social, political, and economic histories of each country, the choices made by individual politicians, and the key political groups that shaped institutional outcomes."
5,The Kremlin’s Plot Against Democracy,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/russian-federation/2020-08-11/putin-kremlins-plot-against-democracy,The Kremlin’s Plot Against Democracy,"As the United States gets ready for the 2020 presidential election, there is reason to think that this time, the country might be spared the massive interference campaign that Russia carried out in 2016. Back then, Moscow had a clear opportunity. The cost of running the Internet Research Agency (IRA), the St. Petersburg–based troll farm set up by the Kremlin to spread disinformation during the U.S. election, was about $1.25 million a month. That was a small price to pay for a remarkable foreign policy coup: a seemingly pro-Russian U.S. president in Donald Trump, a humiliating defeat for Hillary Clinton (whom Russian President Vladimir Putin had long disliked), and, above all, a chance to expose U.S. democracy as dysfunctional. Unprepared and seemingly unaware of the planned Russian operation, the United States was low-hanging fruit."
6,Which Past Is Prologue?,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2020-08-11/history-which-past-prologue,Which Past Is Prologue?,"U.S. President Donald Trump largely ignores the past or tends to get it wrong. “What’s this all about?” he is reported to have asked on a visit to the Pearl Harbor National Memorial, in Hawaii, in 2017. When he has paid attention to history, it has been to call on it as a friendly judge, ready to give him top marks and vindicate him: his administration, he has claimed repeatedly, has been the best in U.S. history. The evidence—something that historians, at least, take seriously—suggests a different picture."
7,The World Trump Made,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/issue-packages/2020-08-11/world-trump-made,What’s Inside,"How will historians judge President Donald Trump’s handling of American foreign policy? Not kindly, writes Margaret MacMillan in this issue’s lead package. After nearly four years of turbulence, the country’s enemies are stronger, its friends are weaker, and the United States itself is increasingly isolated and prostrate."
8,The Bridge: Natural Gas in a Redivided Europe,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2020-08-11/bridge-natural-gas-redivided-europe,The Bridge: Natural Gas in a Redivided Europe,"Few energy issues provoke as much transatlantic angst as Europe’s reliance on Russian natural gas. Critics fret that trusting Russian President Vladimir Putin to keep the heat on invites blackmail. In a useful exploration of Europe’s energy future, Gustafson offers a corrective to this view. Factors beyond geopolitics have shaped and will continue to drive the Russian-European energy relationship. Russia has suddenly stopped exports to Europe on a few occasions, but the business logic of Russian supply and European demand has generally held firm and will likely continue to do so despite U.S. pressure. Gustafson shows how the European Union has used its legal powers—enforcing regulations on competition and requirements to diversify gas transportation links—to limit the ability of the Russian energy giant Gazprom to monopolize supply for the continent. He also outlines how the changing nature of the gas industry itself has shifted the balance of power: Gazprom faces competition from U.S. and Russian liquefied natural gas producers. Indeed, the most ominous development for the natural gas sector may come not from geopolitical tensions with Russia but from growing calls in Europe to keep fossil fuels in the ground."
9,Soviet Judgment at Nuremberg: A New History of the International Military Tribunal After World War II,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2020-08-11/soviet-judgment-nuremberg-new-history-international-military,Soviet Judgment at Nuremberg: A New History of the International Military Tribunal After World War II,"Histories of the Nuremberg trials, held mostly from 1945 to 1946 to punish Nazi leaders for their crimes, have traditionally taken a Western perspective. The Soviet view, examined in this pathbreaking book, rarely receives mention. Yet the Soviets were the first to suggest trials for Nazi leaders, perhaps in order to strengthen reparation claims for the Soviet Union for its unmatched sacrifice during the war. Western countries had initially preferred the summary execution of Nazi officials. Moreover, Soviet lawyers played a key role in developing Nuremberg’s legal innovations, such as the notion that those complicit in a conspiracy were guilty for actions committed by any of its members. Yet once the trials started, the roles reversed, with Western lawyers seeking to stage a high-minded fair trial and the Soviets, under tight leadership from Moscow, looking to stage a didactic show trial. Relations between the Western powers and Moscow grew tenser as Winston Churchill began calling for Western cooperation against the Soviet Union. The propaganda war over the trial offers a glimpse of the beginning of the Cold War."
10,Islamist Foreign Policy in Sudan: Between Radicalism and the Search for Survival,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2020-08-11/islamist-foreign-policy-sudan-between-radicalism-and-search,Islamist Foreign Policy in Sudan: Between Radicalism and the Search for Survival,"Sharfi’s noteworthy study of Sudanese foreign policy during the past 30 years devotes particular attention to the first decade of the Islamist regime that came to power in 1989. Sudan stands at the crossroads of Africa and the Arab world. It maintains close relations with the Gulf states across the Red Sea but is also Ethiopia’s main rival for hegemony in the region. The Islamist coalition government that formed under the aegis of the National Islamic Front in 1989 had wanted to advance through its foreign policy the cause of radical Islam and, initially at least, anti-Western ideals. As Sharfi astutely argues, the regime had to abandon some of this more ideologically driven policy in favor of pragmatism, an evolution that led to the downfall of Hassan al-Turabi, one of the founders of the NIF, and the consolidation of power under President Omar al-Bashir. The book contains case studies, including a particularly interesting chapter devoted to the fallout from Sudan’s role in the botched assassination attempt against Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in 1995 and an analysis of the internal or­ganization of the foreign service, whose technocrats often battled for influence with the ideologues of the NIF."
11,U.S. Policy Toward Africa: Eight Decades of Realpolitik,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2020-08-11/us-policy-toward-africa-eight-decades-realpolitik,U.S. Policy Toward Africa: Eight Decades of Realpolitik,"Cohen is a retired U.S. diplomat who devoted most of his career in the State Department and the White House to Africa. His comprehensive political history of U.S.-African relations carefully chronicles American policy on the continent across successive presidencies, from the administration of Franklin Roosevelt to that of Donald Trump. Cohen emphasizes the continuities across both Democratic and Republican governments and defends most policy actions in terms of the U.S. national interest. The book does a commendable job of explaining a complicated succession of diplomatic initiatives in reaction to events on the continent. Readers will be struck by how the single-minded attention to the Cold War rivalry with the Soviet Union shaped U.S. policy, to the exclusion of salient domestic and regional politics. That emphasis helps explain the sense of policy drift in the second half of the book, when the post–Cold War era leaves U.S. decision-makers without an overarching framework for policy toward African countries."
12,When There Was No Aid: War and Peace in Somaliland,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2020-08-11/when-there-was-no-aid-war-and-peace-somaliland,When There Was No Aid: War and Peace in Somaliland,"The territory of Somaliland unilaterally broke away from Somalia to become an independent state at the beginning of the civil war in 1991. But the international community never formally recognized the legality of this secession. As a result, Somaliland has not received as much international economic or state-building support as Somalia. Nevertheless, it has managed to be more peaceful and democratic than the country it broke away from. Phillips’s nuanced and provocative study is the most compelling account yet of Somaliland’s recent history. Her explanation for the country’s success weaves together domestic and international dynamics. At the domestic level, she shows that a fear of violence and instability encouraged cohesion and a sense of shared civic purpose among social elites. Phillips also argues that the lack of international attention provided space for elites to work out their differences without the often disastrous distraction of courting donors."
13,Regime Threats and State Solutions: Bureaucratic Loyalty and Embeddedness in Kenya,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/regime-threats-and-state-solutions-bureaucratic-loyalty-and-embeddedness-kenya,Regime Threats and State Solutions: Bureaucratic Loyalty and Embeddedness in Kenya,"This remarkable study of the bureaucracy in Kenya since its independence is all the more impressive because it is one of very few recent academic studies of the internal dynamics of an authoritarian state. It can be difficult for scholars to speak meaningfully about the internal political logic of such opaque systems. But Hassan is able to show how successive regimes in Kenya have managed the administration of the state and appointed top bureaucrats to regulate the country’s ethnic elites and maintain political stability. She employs a novel data set that tracks the career trajectories of over 2,000 Kenyan bureaucrats, and she layers in fascinating qualitative data from her interviews with dozens of the officials. Her analysis questions simplistic understandings of the role that ethnicity plays in governing Kenya: many bureaucrats have not come from the president’s ethnic group, even as the president has been far more likely to place administrators from his own ethnic group in key positions. Hassan’s book should be required reading for students of contemporary authoritarian rule."
14,Fighting for Virtue: Justice and Politics in Thailand,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2020-08-11/fighting-virtue-justice-and-politics-thailand,Fighting for Virtue: Justice and Politics in Thailand,"McCargo explores the complicated role of the judiciary in Thailand, where the military, often in league with the monarchy, overthrows elected officials and enforces laws that limit freedom of speech. His new book challenges simplistic interpretations of Thailand’s judges and courts as mere rubber stamps. Instead, he explains with empathy the career path of judges, their perceived special relationship with the crown, their passive collusion with military coups, and their draconian decisions in some of Thailand’s most spectacularly unjust cases of lese majesty and treason, which arose between 2006 and 2016. Rather than dismissing the judiciary as a tool of the military and the monarchy, McCargo uncovers a more ambivalent, messy, and ultimately ineffective organization. He argues convincingly that Thailand’s judges have sought to take up the late King Bhumibol Adulyadej’s charge to resolve Thailand’s intractable political crisis—a conflict that pits the established royal and military authorities against the political opposition elected by the majority of the population. However, McCargo dances around the inconven­ient fact that whatever their complexities, the judges tend to adjudicate cases in favor of the status quo."
15,In the Name of the Nation: India and Its Northeast,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2020-08-11/name-nation-india-and-its-northeast,In the Name of the Nation: India and Its Northeast,"The part of India known as “the Northeast”—a raised fist of land connected to the state of West Bengal through a corridor that runs between Nepal, Bhutan, and Bangladesh—is separate from the rest of the country in ways that are more than geographic. Some six dozen different ethnic groups and tribes populate its eight states, and many are predominantly Christian. Arunachal Pradesh is partly populated by ethnic Tibetans and is claimed by China. About one-third of the people living in Assam are Muslim, most of them viewed as “illegal” immigrants from Bangladesh. There are at least half a dozen armed insurgencies in the region that New Delhi has been battling for close to six decades under a harsh security regime authorized by the Armed Forces Special Powers Act. A program of targeted assassinations eliminated one Assamese rebel group, but the government continues to coexist uneasily with long-running rebellions in Nagaland and Mizoram, among others. Baruah’s intimate history and ethnography shows how neglect, corruption, uneven development, and repression—and recently the rise of Hindu nationalism at the federal level—have intensified the Northeast’s alienation from the rest of the country."
16,Kim Jong Un and the Bomb: Survival and Deterrence in North Korea,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2020-08-11/kim-jong-un-and-bomb-survival-and-deterrence-north-korea,Kim Jong Un and the Bomb: Survival and Deterrence in North Korea,"It has always seemed incredible that a poor country like North Korea could develop not just one but three kinds of nuclear weapons—those fueled by plutonium, those fueled by uranium, and (according to North Korean claims) those fueled by hydrogen—plus the missiles to deliver them. Such disbelief may be the reason why, as Panda points out, the West did little to stop the process until it was too late. His deeply informed book explains as much as is publicly known about how Pyongyang developed nuclear weapons. The government reverse engineered missiles from China and the Soviet Union, got uranium-enrichment centrifuges from the Pakistani official A. Q. Khan in exchange for missile technology, and hired Russian engineers after the collapse of the Soviet Union. But most of the work was done by the country’s own scientists, about whom little is known. Today, North Korean bombs threaten not only U.S. bases in Guam, Japan, and South Korea but the whole American mainland. If there is any good news, it is that Panda believes Pyongyang does not intend to use these weapons for aggression—at least not yet—only to disrupt a planned U.S. invasion before it can happen. The bad news is that Pyongyang might interpret almost any action taken by U.S. forces as just such preparation for an invasion."
17,The Crisis of Liberal Internationalism: Japan and the World Order,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/crisis-liberal-internationalism-japan-and-world-order,The Crisis of Liberal Internationalism: Japan and the World Order,"Can a traditionally restrained Japan play a more active role in defending the liberal international order, now that the United States is retreating from its role as the order’s guarantor? The expert contributors to this volume give the administration of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe high marks for adopting a more proactive foreign policy than its predecessors. Japan rescued the trade agreement formerly known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership after the United States withdrew from it; sought security cooperation with the European Union, Australia, India, and other regional powers; toughened its military posture around the contested Senkaku Islands (known as the Diaoyu Islands in China); and directed development assistance to strengthen governing institutions in democratic countries. The writers recommend further measures in the same direction, including enhancing security cooperation with members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, backing reform at the United Nations and the World Trade Organization, and increasing support for multilateral and civil society organizations that promote the rule of law and environmental rights. The book is a richly informative primer on Japanese politics and foreign policy. But the modesty of its proposals underscores the reality that there is no good solution for Japanese security if the country cannot rely on the alliance with the United States."
18,Two Books and Two Films on Hong Kong,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2020-08-11/two-books-and-two-films-hong-kong,Two Books and Two Films on Hong Kong,"Two books and two documentary films explore the massive anti-China demonstrations that shook Hong Kong in 2014 and over the past year. Cheng is a Hong Kong–based scholar who has been writing on local affairs for four decades. The two dozen articles and book chapters reprinted here trace residents’ transition from political apathy under British colonial rule to resistance to what many view as an even more colonialist Chinese rule. The Basic Law, or “mini-constitution,” that Beijing wrote to define how the territory would be governed after its return to Chinese sovereignty in 1997 created an all-powerful chief executive and a weak legislative council, both beholden to Beijing. China anticipated that Hong Kong residents would learn to accept their status as Chinese citizens as the territory prospered from economic integration with the mainland. Instead, income stagnation, rising housing costs, and growing inequality created pessimism about the future. Beijing’s handpicked chief executives turned out to be politically tone-deaf, and China increasingly interfered in the territory’s politics, judicial autonomy, and media."
19,Civil Rights International,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2020-08-11/racism-civil-rights-international,Civil Rights International,"On June 13, 2020, Black Lives Matter (BLM) activists gathered in London’s Trafalgar Square to call for the eradication of racism and white supremacy. With their fists raised high, the activists, mostly dressed in black, chanted, “Black power!” Were it not for the face masks, which they wore to help stop the spread of COVID-19, the scene could have been taken straight from the 1960s. In that earlier era, activists around the world connected their own struggles to those of African Americans who challenged segregation, disenfranchisement, poverty, and police brutality—just as their successors do today. Meanwhile, Black American activists agitated for human rights and called attention to the devaluation of Black lives not only in the United States but all over the world, including in places under colonial rule."
20,Cairo’s Ultras: Resistance and Revolution in Egypt’s Football Culture,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2020-08-11/cairos-ultras-resistance-and-revolution-egypts-football-culture,Cairo’s Ultras: Resistance and Revolution in Egypt’s Football Culture,"If anyone needs a reminder that policy is made not only by princes, presidents, and politicians but also by the many people who don’t care much about politics but just don’t like to be pushed around, the story of Egypt’s fanatical football fans should do the trick. Close’s book provides an instructive, if imperfect, introduction to the so-called Ultras, who came to widespread attention during and after the 2011 uprising that ousted President Hosni Mubarak from power. They proved to be able foot soldiers during many of the protests, owing less to their political convictions—most had no ideological allegiance—than to their long-standing resentment of the police. Readers unaccustomed to prose describing “a different type of spectacle, freed from the controlled commodity vision, and repurposed as a spectacle of community” may find the language trying. But Close paints an evocative portrait of the varied and ambiguous roles sports can play in an autocracy, where a regime’s reliance on bread and circuses may eventually wear thin in the absence of genuine progress."
21,The State in North Africa: After the Arab Uprisings,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2020-08-11/state-north-africa-after-arab-uprisings,The State in North Africa: After the Arab Uprisings,"Martinez, one of France’s most reliable analysts of North Africa, has crafted a succinct overview of politics on the Mediterranean’s southern shore since the uprisings that rattled the Arab world in 2010–11. He argues that many of the problems that afflict the region were already present when countries there gained independence. He also suggests that all of the region’s governments confront societies that are far more diverse economically, regionally, and ethnically than the official rhetoric would suggest. Deprived of the unity forged by anticolonial struggles elsewhere, North African regimes have had a hard time fashioning national identities that would sustain social cohesion, political legitimacy, and secure borders. In their own ways, Algeria, Libya, Morocco, and Tunisia have all fallen victim to a toxic mix of rapid population growth and high unemployment and have seen many of their citizens swayed by the Islamist promise that “Islam is the solution.” Martinez does not highlight the responsibility that the governments themselves bear in creating this poisonous atmosphere as much as he might; after all, elite corruption, incompetence, and delusions of grandeur play an important role in explaining popular discontent. Nonetheless, this is a good survey of the challenges confronting each of these countries today."
22,MBS: The Rise to Power of Mohammed bin Salman,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2020-08-11/mbs-rise-power-mohammed-bin-salman,MBS: The Rise to Power of Mohammed bin Salman,"This is a fascinating, well-reported, and compellingly recounted story of the rise of Saudi Arabia’s impatient young crown prince and his increasingly brazen concentration of power. Hubbard wears his familiarity with the Middle East lightly and shares it generously, conveying how Mohammed bin Salman (known universally as MBS) has efficiently sidelined his rivals, weakened his opponents, and destroyed his detractors, all while styling himself as the reforming savior of a sclerotic regime. The book is a revealing look at the drawbacks of unaccountable government in an oil kingdom—vast corruption, widespread incompetence, and almost infinite entitlement—as well as a chilling account of how those limitations can nurture ambition unconstrained by honesty, expertise, or loyalty. Hubbard adds disturbing detail to the well-known story of the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, a regime critic, at the hands of regime enforcers close to MBS. The portrait of MBS that emerges from the book resembles no one so much as the brash young man who took power in Libya in 1969: Muammar al-Qaddafi, who initially presented himself as an ambitious modernizer but who went on to spend the next 40 years destroying his own country and spreading mayhem throughout the world."
23,"The Hundred Years’ War on Palestine: A History of Settler Colonialism and Resistance, 1917–2017",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2020-08-11/hundred-years-war-palestine-history-settler-colonialism-and,"The Hundred Years’ War on Palestine: A History of Settler Colonialism and Resistance, 1917–2017","Khalidi, a colleague of mine at Columbia University, is one of today’s most influential historians of the Middle East, a participant in diplomatic efforts on behalf of the Palestinian cause, and a scion of a prominent Palestinian family. In this book, he combines these roles to remarkably good effect. Drawing on family archives and stories passed down through the generations, his own experience in negotiations among Palestinian factions and with the Israelis, and the more conventional tools of the professional historian, Khalidi constructs a powerful argument about the nature of the Zionist claim to Palestine, framing it as a late instance of the settler colonialism that characterized much of British and, later, American imperialism. Not every reader will be comfortable with all of Khalidi’s arguments: few of the protagonists, on any side, come off well, and many Americans would cringe at the idea that they were complicit in imperialist expropriation and domination. But no one who cares about the Middle East’s central conflict can afford to ignore this perspective, and all policymakers need to grapple with its implications. This book pre­sents the most cogent, comprehensive, and compelling account yet of this struggle from the Palestinian vantage point, and it deserves a wide audience."
24,"Egypt’s Diplomacy in War, Peace, and Transition",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2020-08-11/egypts-diplomacy-war-peace-and-transition,"Egypt’s Diplomacy in War, Peace, and Transition","Fahmy, who has served as the Egyptian ambassador to the United States, Egypt’s foreign minister, and dean of the public policy school at the American University in Cairo, has furnished readers with an excellent mixture of memoir and analysis. Fahmy, whose father resigned his post as Egypt’s foreign minister to protest Egyptian President Anwar al-Sadat’s 1977 visit to Jerusalem, adds valuable perspective to the sometimes cacophonous debates about Israel’s relations with its neighbors, the American role in the Middle East, and the vicissitudes of inter-Arab politics. A deeply proud Egyptian, Fahmy is nonetheless candid and self-critical—unusually so for a career diplomat. Although he may not convince his readers at every turn, his book is filled with revealing and thought-provoking insights into people and events as disparate as the “catastrophic” U.S. policy in post-invasion Iraq and the “overwhelmed” military brass who ruled Egypt after the uprising of 2011. And most readers will also come away wishing there were more imaginative and independent minds like Fahmy’s in diplomatic service everywhere today."
25,The Democratic Renewal,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2020-08-11/democratic-renewal,The Democratic Renewal,"If elected president, Joe Biden will inherit a United States that has abdicated its leadership role in the world and lost its claim to moral authority. He will also take the reins of a country still in the throes of a pandemic, still reeling from the economic fallout of the novel coronavirus, and still deeply polarized. This wreckage will exceed even President Barack Obama’s inheritance of a financial crisis and two foundering wars. Biden and his team will have to find some way to reshape U.S. foreign policy and revive the United States’ sense of its purpose in the world."
26,Missions Impossible: Higher Education and Policymaking in the Arab World,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2020-08-11/missions-impossible-higher-education-and-policymaking-arab-world,Missions Impossible: Higher Education and Policymaking in the Arab World,"For those who think the Arab world is stagnating, here’s some news: according to Waterbury—a distinguished political scientist, former president of the American University of Beirut, and my predecessor as this magazine’s regular reviewer for books about the Middle East—the number of universities in the region has quadrupled in the last decade. In a region where employment is highest among young university graduates, this may seem like a ray of hope. Most of these new universities are private institutions, many of them for-profit, and they raise the tantalizing prospect that antiquated educational curricula and pedagogy will evolve to meet the needs of a labor market glutted with unfilled jobs because current graduates don’t have the appropriate skills. Perhaps, too, that market could enlarge the space for institutional autonomy, as such universities might put profits ahead of political agendas in determining their performance metrics. Waterbury is not sanguine; universities everywhere face manifold challenges, and given the Arab world’s history of suffocating political interference and a long-standing brain drain, he thinks the region is unlikely to be the source of dramatic institutional innovation. But the higher education sector is a fascinating prism through which to observe both stagnation and change in the region, and there is no better guide than this book, which is vintage Waterbury: comprehensive, thought provoking, and often droll."
27,"The Dissidents: A Memoir of Working With the Resistance in Russia, 1960–1990",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/dissidents-memoir-working-resistance-russia-1960-1990,"The Dissidents: A Memoir of Working With the Resistance in Russia, 1960–1990","In 1964, as a British graduate student in Moscow, Reddaway was expelled from the Soviet Union for meeting with the wife of a Soviet defector to the United Kingdom. For over three decades thereafter, he remained at the center of Western attempts to help Soviet dissidents. In his memoir, Reddaway shares his recollections of how dissidents struggled for freedom in the face of prison terms and internment in psychiatric hospitals. He describes the Westerners who amplified the dissidents’ cause—politicians, academics, journalists, writers, and publishers. He pays special tribute to the translators whose quiet efforts enabled Soviet dissidents to get their messages to the world. Reddaway identifies “the rise, despite official persecution, of independent thinking and action” as one of the major causes of the collapse of the Soviet Union. In retrospect, however, the contributions of the book’s main protagonists—proponents of civil liberties and democratic freedoms—appear to have been much smaller than those of the nationalist movements in the non-Russian republics. In today’s Russia, the sacrifices of Soviet dissidents remain unappreciated and largely forgotten."
28,Sketches of the Criminal World: Further Kolyma Stories,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2020-08-11/sketches-criminal-world-further-kolyma-stories,Sketches of the Criminal World: Further Kolyma Stories,"During the Stalin era, Shalamov spent over 15 years in prison camps in Kolyma, in the Russian Far East. He documented his experience in short stories, written in a manner that he himself described as “laconic and simple,” with “everything redundant discarded even before . . . picking up my pen.” This book is the second of the two volumes of a complete English translation. In precise and ruthless detail, Shalamov depicts the ordeal of the camp, with its nine months of wintry weather that wore down the prisoners near to death. Survival depended on fortune or cunning. An additional sentence of ten more years didn’t bother an inmate, Shalamov writes, since “there was no sense in planning your life more than one day ahead.” This volume of Shalamov’s stories focuses on the blatari—professional criminals or gangsters. Shalamov condemns the Russian literary tradition (that includes Fyodor Dostoyevsky, as well as Maxim Gorky and Isaac Babel) of romanticizing the criminal world. By contrast, he sees blatari as “beyond human morality.” A story called “The Glove” describes an old man whose hands are blown off for speaking disrespectfully to a young gangster: the man is forced to hold in his bound hands a percussion cap with a fuse."

He focuses on two scandalous and charismatic figures: Eduard Limonov and Aleksandr Dugin. In the early 1990s, they launched the National Bolshevik Party, which merged anti-mainstream artistic expression and radical nationalist ideas with political action. The NBP categorically rejected Western capitalism and encouraged personal, cultural, and sexual freedom and transgressive behavior. Its followers included those as diverse as radical artists and disgruntled provincial youth. Dugin, an eccentric and prolific philosopher and writer, later gravitated toward the Kremlin establishment, but Limonov remained forever a rebel and a contrarian—whether as an anti-Western immigrant in the United States; as the author of the 1979 novel It’s Me, Eddie, which included intense violence and graphic descriptions of gay sex; or as an avid traveler to war zones in Abkhazia, Transnistria, and the former Yugoslavia. Fenghi posits that Limonov saw his own life as an artistic project, making his real-life persona inseparable from his writing and his politics. A month after the publication of Fenghi’s book, Limonov died in Moscow. In addition to offering a profound and probing understanding of the post-­Soviet political and cultural fringe, the book serves as an homage to its controversial protagonists."

Wolff’s enthralling account traces the way the president’s principles clashed with the messy reality of historical frontiers and political rivalries in the region. Wilson’s belief in the right of all peoples to decide their own futures collided with his involvement in what he described as “carving a piece of Poland out of Germany’s side” and “rearranging the territorial divisions of the Balkan states.” He belatedly grew aware of the problem of “national minorities,” seeing that their aspirations were impossible to reconcile with those of majority communities. The system of nation-states in eastern Europe, which emerged thanks in large part to Wilson’s efforts, persisted through most of the twentieth century. But in the process, as Wolff describes, Wilson discovered that his dream of justice and self-determination was a barely sustainable fantasy."

His concise and lively narrative begins in the early 1860s, when Tsar Alexander II launched liberal reforms, and ends in the early 1930s, when Stalin established systems for the total censoring of the oral word. The intervening period was “the stenographic age”: the skills of shorthand (which evolved in Russia primarily as a woman’s job) played a major role in allowing Russian society to hear itself. The introduction of jury trials in the second half of the nineteenth century spurred the rise of courtroom eloquence; Russian Orthodox priests abandoned the traditional, scholastic language incomprehensible to uneducated worshipers and spoke to parish­ioners about pressing social issues in a direct manner. The longest chapter focuses on the proceedings of Russia’s short-lived parliament, from 1905 to 1917, including fascinating portraits of Duma deputies such as Vladimir Nabokov (the famous writer’s father), “who combined Russian aristocratic poise with the robustness of an English parliamentarian.” The victory of the Bolsheviks in the subsequent revolutionary upheaval owed much to their unparalleled ability to whip up agitated crowds with passionate speeches."

Society may be rigged against them, but Brum’s subjects draw on deep wells of strength and perseverance; many find joy in the struggle itself, in their “everyday insurrections.” The more moving stories include a factory worker ailing from asbestos poisoning who stubbornly refuses to die until the offending corporation offers his family acceptable monetary compensation for his death, a woman with serious disabilities who heroically overcomes a series of social barriers, and an elderly man who collects garbage (“leftover souls”) with the artistic sensibility of a Marcel Duchamp. By calling attention to deep social injustices in Brazil, Brum may be seeking to mobilize public opinion behind corrective policies. But readers will be forgiven for concluding that the immense human suffering that Brum sketches so powerfully will persist from generation to generation, with no relief in sight."
33,"Brazil Apart, 1964–2019",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2020-08-11/brazil-apart-1964-2019,"Brazil Apart, 1964–2019","In this collection of essays—mostly published first in the London Review of Books—Anderson deploys mordant Marxist critiques, provocative class analysis, and perceptive political narrative to analyze the shifting landscape of Brazilian politics. In the earlier essays, he begrudgingly places some hope in the newly elected Fernando Henrique Cardoso, an intellectual “cosmopolitan prince” and president of Brazil from 1995 to 2002, only to dismiss his opportunism in later essays. Similarly, Anderson held high hopes for the Workers’ Party and for its authentic working-class leader, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who was president of Brazil from 2003 to 2010. Anderson struggles to explain the profound moral and political deterioration of the Workers’ Party and the recent rise of the evangelical culture warrior Jair Bolsonaro, the current president. Shocking corruption scandals and prolonged austerity feature significantly in Anderson’s admonitions. He also faults the Workers’ Party for not better mobilizing and educating its members, for its “myopic philistinism” in ignoring the advice of intellectuals, and for its weak reformism and recourse to stale campaign slogans. In the epilogue, Anderson expresses fear that Brazil may be moving backward, to the type of military dictatorship that ruled the country from 1964 to 1985, slipping into another authoritarian nightmare."
34,A Long Petal of the Sea,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2020-08-11/long-petal-sea,A Long Petal of the Sea,"A Long Petal of the Sea (a reference to the geography of Chile) weaves a love story spanning the Spanish Civil War and the coup that toppled the leftist Chilean president Salvador Allende in 1973. The prolific and celebrated author also happens to be related to the deposed president. In the novel, she reimagines the real voyage of a cargo ship, the SS Winnipeg, that in 1939 ferried desperate refugees from the Spanish Civil War to Chile. When many countries were closing their doors to European immigrants, the progressive Chilean government tasked the diplomat and poet Pablo Neruda with selecting the Winnipeg’s lucky 2,200 passengers. Allende deplores the reactionary vengeance of General Francisco Franco in Spain, mocks the Chilean aristocracy for its provincial arrogance, and decries the military dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet for its unspeakable atrocities. Her strong-willed protagonists endure historical tragedies, eventually setting aside their youthful utopian idealism for professional accomplishments and enduring love."

Hurtado-Torres is impressed by the astuteness of well-networked U.S. diplomats, their distaste for corrupt local hacks, and their preference for effective progressive (but not too progressive) leaders. U.S. diplomacy succeeded, Hurtado-Torres convincingly shows, when it was most closely aligned with the interests of local partners (notably President Eduardo Frei Montalva and his centrist Christian Democrats) and when respectful of local institutions. Not surprisingly, disentangling U.S. influence from local politics proves a difficult methodological task for the historian; the anticommunist bent of U.S. policy during the Cold War may have contributed to severe political polarization in Chile, but the deepening left-right ideological divide among Chileans was the primary driver of political strife and led, inexorably, to the tragedy of the violent 1973 military coup that extinguished Chilean democracy for nearly a generation."
36,The Cubans: Ordinary Lives in Extraordinary Times,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2020-08-11/cubans-ordinary-lives-extraordinary-times,The Cubans: Ordinary Lives in Extraordinary Times,"In this beautifully crafted work of reportage, the veteran journalist DePalma dives into Guanabacoa, a historic, decaying neighborhood of Havana, and into the lives of its inhabitants. Among the lead characters is Caridad Limonta, a brilliant executive who abandons state-owned enterprises to apply her management skills in the emerging private sector. Arturo Montoto, an established conceptual artist, constructs ironic monumental sculptures, including a huge black baseball that evokes the decline of professional sports in Cuba. DePalma also meets Jorge García, an émigré living in Miami, who remains deeply embittered by the deaths in 1994 of family members who drowned trying to flee Cuba in a tugboat. Through such stories, DePalma takes the reader on a tour of the glorious triumphs and ardent idealism of the early days of the Cuban Revolution, the dark years of the post-Soviet economic collapse, the revived hopes occasioned by the thaw of U.S.-Cuban relations under U.S. President Barack Obama, and now the seemingly endless days of deprivation. As daily life becomes increasingly difficult in Cuba, the distance grows between the privileged elites in their white Ladas and the impoverished masses on their bicycles. But as Limonta explains, cubanidad, or “Cubanness,” retains its richness: that blend of outsize exceptionalism, intense passions, and inextinguishable love."
37,Giving Up on God,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/world/2020-08-11/religion-giving-god,Giving Up on God,"In the early years of the twenty-first century, religion seemed to be on the rise. The collapse of both communism and the Soviet Union had left an ideological vacuum that was being filled by Orthodox Christianity in Russia and other post-Soviet states. The election in the United States of President George W. Bush, an evangelical Christian who made no secret of his piety, suggested that evangelical Christianity was rising as a political force in the country. And the 9/11 attacks directed international attention to the power of political Islam in the Muslim world."
38,The Life and Death of Ancient Cities: A Natural History,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/life-and-death-ancient-cities-natural-history,The Life and Death of Ancient Cities: A Natural History,"Today, for the first time in human history, more than half of humanity lives in cities. Yet until about 500 years ago, cities were few and fragile. This book focuses on history’s major exception: the Mediterranean in classical antiquity. Overall urbanization rates there reached around 20 percent, higher than Europe would see again until the nineteenth century. The force behind ancient Mediterranean urbanization was economic: control over the surplus from surrounding agricultural land and, for the largest cities, privileged access to long-distance trade. Yet ancient cities were not self-sufficient: the more they grew, the more taxes they had to levy; the more food, water, stone, metals, and luxury goods they had to import; and the more slave labor they needed to offset high urban mortality from famine, disease, fire, and natural disasters. Ancient cities became the hubs of hegemonies and empires—a highly leveraged arrangement that made them vulnerable to sudden shocks and military decline. They collapsed much faster than they had been built: in three centuries, Rome’s population declined from over a million to just about 10,000. Today’s global cities face similar vulnerabilities, and one wonders whether future historians will write about them in the same way."
39,Theodor Herzl: The Charismatic Leader,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2020-08-11/theodor-herzl-charismatic-leader,Theodor Herzl: The Charismatic Leader,"This pocket biography demystifies—then re-mystifies—Theodor Herzl, the founder of the Zionist movement. At 35, despite possessing neither deep knowledge of Jewish culture nor any known religious beliefs, he penned a classic pamphlet, The Jewish State, asserting a demand on behalf of European Jews for their own nation-state—on the model of the demands of Czechs, Serbs, and other groups within the Austro-Hungarian Empire. For the next nine years, before dying quite young, he organized continent-wide conferences, harangued national leaders, visited Palestine, and churned out speeches and articles. Although historians dismiss Herzl’s intellectual achievements, this book seeks to reinterpret him as a brilliant organizer and activist. Yet it is hard to see why. At the time, most people viewed him as a crackpot. Upper-class Jews (including his wife) disparaged Zionism as an unsavory mass ideology. Orthodox groups criticized it as unholy. Herzl’s own vague and inconsistent plans for governing a Jewish state were fashioned with remarkable ignorance of Palestine—when he wasn’t weighing Argentina or Mozambique as an alternative. This book reminds readers that intellectuals are sometimes remembered simply for stating an ideal goal that, much later and for reasons unforeseeable by them, becomes reality."

Start with Steve Bannon, the Harvard-educated former U.S. Navy officer, investment banker, and Breitbart News executive who became U.S. President Donald Trump’s alt-right political strategist. Fired within a year of the 2016 election, Bannon now promotes nationalist, far-right populists in Europe. Seeking to understand the roots of Bannon’s eccentric post-fascist beliefs, Teitelbaum (a music professor who also studies radical populists) convinced him to sit for 20 hours of interviews. Teitelbaum sets out to find the leaders of Bannon’s underground “spiritual school” committed to “Traditionalism,” a secretive ideology that rejects modernity, the Enlightenment, materialism, and globalization. They include a bearded supporter of Russian President Vladimir Putin who promotes “Eurasianism” as an alternative to the rotten West, the former leader of a Hungarian nationalist and anti-Roma party, an Iranian American author peddling plans for a eugenic purification of Persians, a Brazilian philosopher active on social media and close to Brazil’s current populist government, and a Briton with obscure corporate and political connections and the code name “Jellyfish.” Fun stuff—but in the end, the Traditionalists seem like cranks with obscure, inconsistent beliefs and only a small following."

On challenges, they recycle clichés: the world is materially better but people remain dissatisfied, inequality and xenophobia threaten liberal democracy, globalization creates turmoil, and smaller countries such as the United Kingdom are being cut out of the emerging twenty-first-century great-power competition among China, India, Russia, and the United States. Skip to the second half, however, and their analysis of how the United Kingdom, a middle power, should adapt to decline and to the consequences of Brexit proves more engaging and original. They tally national assets and capabilities and conclude that the United Kingdom can and will ally with the Europeans on most military and diplomatic initiatives, but that the British can still play an outsize role by exploiting their robust nonmilitary instruments of power: global networks of foreign aid, strong intelligence capacities, diplomatic expertise, world-class financial and educational sectors—and the soft power created by the British monarchy, the BBC, and soccer’s Premier League. To bolster the country’s status, they recommend a “strategic surge” of spending, focused primarily on these nonmilitary policy instruments."

Gardner’s term began with the 2014 Ukraine crisis, which ironically helped deflect attention from transatlantic differences over a litany of other issues, including digital surveillance, the euro crisis, and a proposed transatlantic trade agreement. Gardner spent much of his time trying to pry decisions from the bureaucratic and procedure-bound EU system. But he insists nonetheless that the interests of the EU and the United States are more closely aligned than those of any other two parts of the world. They can and should cooperate closely not just on economic issues but also on law enforcement, counterterrorism, sanctions, energy, the environment, foreign aid, and military security. This compelling book also makes a strong case for the EU as a preferred U.S. partner and dismisses Brexit as absurd. Gardner’s term ended in 2017. Just three years later, after his successor admitted pursuing U.S. President Donald Trump’s domestic political objectives in Ukraine, the former ambassador’s cultural sensitivity, deep experience, and genuine belief in transatlantic cooperation seem like relics of a forgotten era."
43,The Age of Hiroshima,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2020-08-11/age-hiroshima,The Age of Hiroshima,"The essays chosen for this rich volume are an attempt by its editors to “unsettle” the legacy and understanding of the bombing of Hiroshima, an act that triggered the nuclear age 75 years ago. This collection explores the age’s unanswered questions from a global perspective, rather than through the prism of the Cold War. It is not only geographically broad; it is also enriched by the diverse perspectives of historians, political scientists, and other theorists of international relations. One set of chapters reveals, for example, that the familiar binary categories of nuclear state and nonnuclear state hide a fluid spectrum of conditions of which these are merely the endpoints. Other chapters explore the ways political and cultural contexts constrain the choices leaders can make about nuclear weapons and programs. And some contributors wrestle with the surprising fact that many pivotal questions about the nuclear age—for instance, does deterrence work?—remain unanswerable."
44,Lie Machines,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/lie-machines,Lie Machines,"The universe of social media is almost incomprehensibly massive: people write 500 million tweets, send 65 billion WhatsApp messages, and post four petabytes of material on Facebook every day. Lurking within this churn of content is what Howard dubs a “lie machine”: a global enterprise of bots, conspiracy theorists, politicians, scammers, authoritarian governments, and more that is devoted to spreading disinformation in the service of ideology, profit, and power. Automated, scalable, anonymous, and capable of microtargeting to the level of the individual, the machine shapes today’s politics. Its operations undermine democracies by stoking skepticism, polarizing societies, and destroying trust in all the once authoritative sources of information (including journalists, scientists, experts, and political leaders). Howard traces the evolution of the lie machine from Russia’s deployment of armies of online trolls to the use of advanced chatbots, which mimic human interaction. As dangerous as things are now, they will only get worse; the enormous flood of data coming from the so-called Internet of Things, along with the growing sophistication of artificial intelligence, will make disinformation easier to generate and disseminate and much harder to spot and remove. Howard tackles the tough task of suggesting the changes that are needed to create a radically redesigned social media ecosystem that would reinforce, rather than erode, democracy."

The decision was immensely important not only because of the existential threat of climate change but also because no one in the Supreme Court’s two-century history had ever before won a case against the federal government after losing in the lower courts. In vivid detail, with every sentence clear to a nonlawyer, Lazarus traces the story of the case through eight years of ups and downs. He brings to life the strategy of brief writing, how petitioners try to beat the slim odds of the high court hearing their case, an attorney’s 200 hours of agonizing preparation for a 30-minute oral argument, and the culture and operations of the Supreme Court. This case highlighted the work of the late, brilliant justice John Paul Stevens, who, at 86, was determined to write a momentous decision while holding together a fragile majority. This is a riveting story, beautifully told."

Hart mines a massive database of political speech that reaches back to 1948, running various computer programs to assess word choice, rhetorical patterns, and the contexts in which politicians use certain language. The data are interesting: for instance, Trump used terms related to anger and hurt in 2016 nearly five times as often as the political norm. Hart’s own perceptions are striking. He sees Trump less as a baby or a toddler, as he is often portrayed by critics, than as an adolescent: moody, impulsive, terribly needy for love, resentful of authority, full of fears he cannot admit, and emotionally raw. In Hart’s analysis, Trump has tapped into four primary public emotions: feelings of being ignored, of being trapped, of being besieged (by elites and outsiders), and of weariness (with the political establishment). Switching between Trump’s words and their reception by his supporters yields insights that other observers of the president haven’t discerned."

The United States, said one of the bill’s sponsors, “will cease to be the ‘melting pot.’” Under the new law’s strict ethnic quotas—including its total exclusion of Asians—fewer immigrants entered the country in the subsequent four decades than had arrived in the first decade of the twentieth century. But the law set up another decades-long fight, which culminated in the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, which abolished the restrictive quotas. President Lyndon Johnson welcomed its passage with a paean to the “nation of strangers” who had built the United States by “joining and blending in one mighty and irresisti­ble tide.” But that law too proved contentious. With quotas for Mexicans set far below the demand for their labor and visas based on family reunification rather than skills, it sparked new tensions. Immigration remains a deeply contested issue that Americans continue to struggle with today. Yang, a senior editor at The New York Times and the daughter of immigrants, tells the story of the important fight for the 1965 law with an immediacy that comes from being one of its direct beneficiaries."

As did its predecessor, Ghost Fleet, which concerned a future war with China, this novel comes with a full set of endnotes to show that it is not purely a work of the imagination. The plot takes place in a dystopian United States in which unconstrained automation has led to mass unemployment and a restive public. As a conspiracy of neo-Luddite villains, each with his or her own agenda, tries to inflame and exploit the unrest, the FBI agent Lara Keegan seeks to limit the damage and find the culprits. She enjoys the assistance of a robot, whose effectiveness and value she must assess. It learns on the job, constantly accessing and interpreting vast amounts of information. The novel is fast moving and readable, and it explores important questions about whether and how humanity can benefit from intelligent machines without being overwhelmed by them."

Buchanan traces the progression of hacking operations beginning with the early efforts of the U.S. National Security Agency and the United Kingdom’s Government Communications Headquarters, or GCHQ, agencies that intercept all sorts of communications—including those of supposedly friendly governments. Many countries now engage in hacking in the pursuit of their national interests. The joint U.S.-Israeli operation that transmitted the Stuxnet virus that sabotaged centrifuges in Iran was discovered in 2010. Russia easily shut down Ukraine’s energy supplies through hacking in 2016 and famously meddled in the U.S. presidential election that same year by hacking the email accounts of Democratic Party officials and the chair of Hillary Clinton’s campaign. China has used hacking for the purposes of industrial sabotage. The 2013 revelations of the former NSA contractor Edward Snowden showed how Western governments did their spying. Despite the growing ubiquity of cyberattacks, Buchanan also highlights their limits as a means of coercion or as a way of sending a message."

In a thoughtful and probing series of essays, Gavin explores the dissonance between how theorists plotted the nuclear age and how events actually unfurled. He explores, for instance, how leaders fretted about “quantitative superiority”—boasting bigger nuclear arsenals than their rivals—when it provided no route to victory. He also tries to understand why the United States put so much effort into preventing other states from getting their own nuclear weapons when doing so meant that Washington had to take more responsibility for the security of others."

Its officers try to both persuade governments to adopt policies to reduce their overall debts and help those governments restructure their debts to reduce the burden on future budgets. The IMF held a conference in 2018 to collect this accumulated knowledge, and the result is this volume, with contributions from over 30 authors. The explosion of budget deficits as a result of the coronavirus pandemic suggests that this collected wisdom will be especially useful in future years, providing guidance on both what to do and what not to do."

In this clear and vigorously written book, she argues that any country that borrows in its own currency in a floating exchange-rate system has no effective limit on its central-government debt. A country reaches the limits of its ability to spend when the rate of inflation rises; the size of its budget deficits and public debt is irrelevant. Kelton sets these compelling arguments in a broader left-wing agenda for the United States that includes greater environmental protections and government-guaranteed work, with minimum pay fixed at $15 per hour, for any U.S. resident who desires it. Recent U.S. congressional fiscal action in response to the pandemic, as well as new programs launched by the Federal Reserve, suggests that the author is at least partly right in her assessment of the spending power of governments."

This export boom permitted a change in development strategies from those that prevailed in the late twentieth century with the backing of international financial institutions, especially the World Bank. The author traces patterns across countries and explores domestic political dynamics that led to shifts in economic policy."

GDP is a measure of how a national economy uses its resources—labor, land, and capital—to produce goods and services during a particular period of time, usually a year. But GDP has come to be used much more widely as a measure of economic growth and as a proxy for economic well-being, often without important qualifications and caveats. The misuse of GDP has troubled an increasing number of economists and noneconomists. This volume successfully explains what GDP does not and cannot measure well and suggests that countries should publish a dashboard that measures what is really important. The authors propose 67 indicators that would present a more complete picture of the health of a national economy. Although these are useful measures, many countries would find it a challenge to collect and maintain such thorough statistics."

As a system for organizing economies and societies, capitalism has won and has no rival. It provides more prosperity with a modicum of freedom than any other system. But the author distinguishes several competing kinds of capitalism. He focuses on two variants: liberal meritocratic capitalism, embodied by the United States, and political (authoritarian) capitalism, embodied by China. The latter, which boasts good bureaucrats but lacks the rule of law, carries the possibly fatal flaw of inherent corruption. Milanovic makes the compelling argument that communism brought much of the developing world out of feudalism and into the modern world without developing an industrial middle class, as capitalism did in Europe and North America. But the factors that helped produce higher standards of living for industrial workers in the West—trade unions, mass education, and progressive taxation and transfers—have receded in recent decades. The author hopes for a future defined by what he calls “people’s capitalism,” in which the economy isn’t so skewed to the advantage of those who own capital at the expense of those who make a living through their labor. But Milanovic is not confident that a more equal capitalism will emerge."
56,The Challenges of Multilateralism,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2020-08-11/challenges-multilateralism,The Challenges of Multilateralism,"The post-1815 Concert of Europe was a watershed in diplomatic history, fostering a tradition of multilateral diplomacy. By the end of the nineteenth century, traders, jurists, professional groups, and social activists were working across borders to establish multilateral institutions to coordinate their activities. Lavelle argues that the interwar period was also a surprisingly important era in the evolution of multilateral cooperation. The United States failed to join the League of Nations, but private networks of cooperation flourished. Bankers negotiated deals to stabilize financial flows, and the Rockefeller Foundation was the driving force in fostering international cooperation on public health. Lavelle shows that the post-1945 explosion of multilateralism was possible precisely because of trial and error in earlier decades. Chapters explore the founding and evolution of the United Nations, the Bretton Woods system, the decolonization movement, alliances, and public health and environmental cooperation. Lavelle’s most important contention is that multilateralism is less an idealistic aspiration than a pragmatic tool for managing economic and security interdependence. Multilateralism may be in retreat today, but it remains the best solution for the world’s increasingly complex problems."
57,The End of American Illusion,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/americas/2020-08-11/end-american-illusion,The End of American Illusion,"Since the end of the Cold War, most U.S. policymakers have been beguiled by a set of illusions about the world order. On critical issues, they have seen the world as they wish it were and not how it really is. President Donald Trump, who is not a product of the American foreign policy community, does not labor under these illusions. Trump has been a disrupter, and his policies, informed by his heterodox perspective, have set in motion a series of long-overdue corrections. Many of these necessary adjustments have been misrepresented or misunderstood in today’s vitriolic, partisan debates. But the changes Trump has initiated will help ensure that the international order remains favorable to U.S. interests and values and to those of other free and open societies."
58,Orders of Exclusion: Great Powers and the Strategic Sources of Foundational Rules in International Relations,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2020-08-11/orders-exclusion-great-powers-and-strategic-sources-foundational,Orders of Exclusion: Great Powers and the Strategic Sources of Foundational Rules in International Relations,"In this impressive study of order building in the modern era, Lascurettes argues that powerful states have long shaped the rules of the international order to undermine rival states. The book offers detailed historical accounts of great ordering moments from the seventeenth to the twentieth century. In each instance, Lascurettes sees the dominant state proposing principles and institutions that would weaken or exclude states that threatened its security and primacy. The victors of the Thirty Years’ War devised rules of sovereign statehood to undercut the universalist authority of the papacy and the Holy Roman Empire. The post-Napoleonic Concert of Europe was organized to protect conservative monarchical regimes from emerging liberal and revolutionary states. U.S. President Woodrow Wilson’s emphasis on national self-determination after World War I was at least partly aimed at countering the revolutionary ideals of the Bolshevik Revolution, and the post-1945 U.S.-led order was defined in opposition to fascist and communist rivals. Lascurettes contrasts his theory with the work of other scholars who see the modern international order as built through consensus and infused with universalist aspirations. The book’s contribution is less in its interpretations of history than in its illumination of the ways in which international rules and institutions empower some states and undercut others."
59,Disunited Nations: The Scramble for Power in an Ungoverned World,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2020-08-11/disunited-nations-scramble-power-ungoverned-world,Disunited Nations: The Scramble for Power in an Ungoverned World,"This quick-paced tour of today’s fragmenting global order ominously warns that more chaos and conflict is on the way. According to Zeihan, the post-1945 era of peace and prosperity was a historical aberration, made possible by a U.S.-led system of trade and alliances. This hegemonic system—what he calls “the Order”—provided the foundation for decades of progress in education, health, prosperity, security, democracy, and human connectivity. The bad news, according to Zeihan, is that the Order was a historically unique, never-to-be-repeated anomaly, and its demise will spark chaos and disorder on an epic scale. The Trump administration is speeding up the process, but the Order has been weakening for decades. Zeihan offers a gloomy picture of collapsing markets, deteriorating global norms, escalating conflicts over energy and food, and the return of great-power struggles over maritime supremacy and territorial borders. Scholars who debate the consequences of hegemonic decline will find this tale familiar."
60,The World: A Brief Introduction,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2020-08-11/world-brief-introduction,The World: A Brief Introduction,"Writing for a popular audience, Haass provides a clear and concise account of the history, diplomacy, economics, and societal forces that have molded the modern global system. The book begins by telling the story of the rise of the Western state system, the subsequent centuries of war and peacemaking, and the Cold War and its aftermath. In other chapters, Haass examines the political, economic, and demographic forces that have shaped Europe, Asia, the Middle East, Africa, and the Americas, and he explains globalization through sections on trade, finance, migration, climate change, terrorism, and cyberspace. The book avoids theoretical debates, focusing instead on the interplay between broad world-historical forces—science and technology, capitalism, nationalism, power politics—and diplomacy and leadership. The rise of liberal democracy and economic interdependence has encouraged rules-based relations and global governance, but anarchy and the threat of war always loom in the background. Haass gives credit to the United States for underwriting the postwar liberal order, but he also sees American leadership on the wane, nationalism reasserting itself, and an increasingly ambitious China seeking to tilt the world away from liberal democracy. If the liberal order cannot be rebuilt, Haass expects a more fragmented world order to emerge, one organized around spheres of influence."
61,"The Ages of Globalization: Geography, Technology, and Institutions",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2020-08-11/ages-globalization-geography-technology-and-institutions,"The Ages of Globalization: Geography, Technology, and Institutions","This masterful history of the human experience of global interconnectedness begins in the Paleolithic Age and ends in today’s COVID-19 pandemic. Sachs makes a powerful case that the globalizing forces creating our increasingly interdependent world are deeply rooted in the human condition and that they are forces—for better and worse—that are here to stay. The book identifies seven ages of globalization, from the classical age to the digital age. In each, technology, geography, and social institutions have shaped the frontiers of economic advancement and human interaction. Sachs shows that in each successive period, the scale of organization, exchange, and cooperation has dramatically increased. The book acknowledges both the upside and the downside of globalization: it has created opportunities for learning, economic growth, and new forms of political community, even as it has brought great suffering to the world through disease, conquest, war, and financial crises. On balance, Sachs seems to think that the gains from globalization are indisputable, and in each historical age, it has fostered social advancement. But Sachs’s history also shows that the revolutions in technology that propel globalization tend to outpace the ability of governments to manage their consequences."
62,To Protect and to Serve,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2020-07-30/police-reform-global-lessons,To Protect and to Serve,"Public outcry over the murders of Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, and George Floyd earlier this year has ignited mass demonstrations against structural racism and police violence in the United States. The protests have reached every American state and spread to countries around the world; they arguably constitute the most broad-based civil rights movement in American history. Protests against the brutalization of communities of color by the U.S. criminal justice system have been growing for years, but the explosive scale of the uprising this spring and summer makes it clear that the United States has reached a national reckoning."
63,Citizens of the World,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/review-essay/2020-08-11/citizens-world,Citizens of the World,"One thing that has long made Europe what it is, distinct from any other part of the world, is a peculiar mix of division and integration. Since the fall of Rome, Europe has never been unified by an overarching imperial power. Instead, the continent evolved from feudal fragmentation into a system of independent, competing nation-states, restrained from devouring one another—at least before the twentieth century—by a system of balance-of-power politics. Competition goaded each state to develop its political and economic capabilities, so that by the mid-1700s, the continent as a whole was well on the way to realizing its potential to dominate other regions—a power that would alter the world in the age of imperialism."
64,League of Nationalists,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2020-08-11/modi-india-league-nationalists,League of Nationalists,"Under President Donald Trump, the United States’ relations with many of its closest friends have deteriorated drastically. Longtime allies and partners in Asia, Europe, and North America have been reeling from the president’s trade disputes, decisions to withdraw the United States from international treaties, allegations of free-riding, and “America first” approach to the world. German Chancellor Angela Merkel spoke for many spurned allies when she said in 2017, “We Europeans must really take our fate into our own hands.”"

The title, with its biblical echo, was immodest, but in Acheson’s defense, it was deserved."
66,The Pandemic Depression,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2020-08-06/coronavirus-depression-global-economy,The Pandemic Depression,"The COVID-19 pandemic poses a once-in-a-generation threat to the world’s population. Although this is not the first disease outbreak to spread around the globe, it is the first one that governments have so fiercely combated. Mitigation efforts—including lockdowns and travel bans—have attempted to slow the rate of infections to conserve available medical resources. To fund these and other public health measures, governments around the world have deployed economic firepower on a scale rarely seen before."
67,The Tragedy of Vaccine Nationalism,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2020-07-27/vaccine-nationalism-pandemic,The Tragedy of Vaccine Nationalism,"Trump administration officials have compared the global allocation of vaccines against the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 to oxygen masks dropping inside a depressurizing airplane. “You put on your own first, and then we want to help others as quickly as possible,” Peter Marks, a senior official at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration who oversaw the initial phases of vaccine development for the U.S. government, said during a panel discussion in June. The major difference, of course, is that airplane oxygen masks do not drop only in first class—which is the equivalent of what will happen when vaccines eventually become available if governments delay providing access to them to people in other countries."

We were quite friendly. We had shared stories about our work experiences and had politely sparred over the deepening chasm between the United States and China. I was about to leave China after seven years, and I was looking forward to a warm goodbye."

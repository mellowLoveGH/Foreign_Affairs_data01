0,Energy's Hottest Sector,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/world/2015-02-11/energys-hottest-sector,Energy’s Hottest Sector,"Over the past several years, the shale revolution has upended oil and gas markets in the United States and the world at large. At first, shale development was dismissed as unworkable, then it was minimized as unsustainable. Now, having helped drive a massive drop in the global price of oil, it is hailed as an economic and geopolitical game changer. But shale isn’t the only energy story of interest, nor even the only potentially revolutionary one. The electricity sector is quietly undergoing its own transformation, and it is likely to yield dramatic economic and social benefits. So we decided to take a closer look."
1,Upgrading the Grid,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2015-02-16/upgrading-grid,Upgrading the Grid,"The U.S. electrical grid has hardly changed since the War of Currents, the 1880s fight that saw George Westinghouse’s alternating current triumph over Thomas Edison’s direct current as the preferred method for generating and transmitting electricity. It remains a network of long-distance transmission and distribution lines designed to move electricity in one direction: from giant, lumbering fossil fuel plants to faraway households and businesses. This system has endured because it has proved safe, reliable, effective, and affordable."
2,Battery Powered,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2015-03-01/battery-powered,Battery Powered,"The plunge in oil prices that began in mid-2014 has been relentless. It has pushed a clutch of oil-exporting nations into deficit spending, hobbled Russia’s ambitions, and altered the calculus behind Iran’s nuclear program. It has also given an opportune boost to the U.S. economy and other petroleum-consuming countries. No other force on earth packs such latent capacity to move events. Apart from one, that is: batteries."
3,Power to the Poor,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/africa/2015-02-16/power-poor,Power to the Poor,"Imagine life without electricity. With no lights, electric stove, or water pump, you must travel miles to fetch water and firewood, running a particular risk of attack if you are a girl or a woman. At home, you cook over a smoky stove or an open fire, raising your odds of getting lung and heart disease. If you are pregnant, you may die in the dark, giving birth at a clinic that lacks air conditioning and modern medical equipment. Without vaccines, which require refrigeration, your children remain vulnerable to deadly diseases. At night, they study by the light of a kerosene lamp, which causes burns when the fuel spills. Earning a living isn’t easy, either. No electricity means no sewing machines or rice mills, no pumps for irrigating crops, and no way to keep drinks cold or keep a store open at night. The lack of power keeps away bigger companies that might have hired you."
4,Solar Power Comes of Age,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/united-states/solar-power-comes-age,Solar Power Comes of Age,"Solar power has been declared a winner before, only to flounder. It’s easy to remain skeptical today, given that solar power accounts for less than one percent of the global energy supply. But it is also expanding faster than any other power source, with an average growth rate of 50 percent a year for the past six years. Annual installations of photovoltaic panels increased from a capacity of less than 0.3 gigawatts in 2000 to 45 gigawatts in 2014—enough to power more than 7.4 million American homes. This time really is different: solar power is ready to compete on its own terms."
5,The World According to Kissinger,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/world-according-kissinger,The World According to Kissinger,"How many authors could title their book simply World Order without sounding utterly presumptuous? Henry Kissinger still plays in a league of his own. For admirers and critics alike, he is more than just a former U.S. secretary of state and previous national security adviser. Some see him as the quintessential wise man of U.S. foreign policy; others, as a diehard realpolitiker hanging on to yesterday’s world; and still others, as a perennial bête noire. To all, he remains larger than life. And regardless of how one views Kissinger, his new book is tremendously valuable."
6,The Trouble With Race,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/trouble-race,The Trouble With Race,"Everybody knows that racial tensions have been at the center of American political debate in recent months, but the story of racial and ethnic division is actually a global one, with a long and tortured history. For the lead package in the March/April issue, therefore, we decided to do a deep dive into racial issues in comparative and historical perspective."
7,Racial Inequality After Racism,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2015-03-01/racial-inequality-after-racism,Racial Inequality After Racism,"Last summer, the killings of two unarmed African American men—Eric Garner in Staten Island, New York, and Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri—by white police officers reignited the national conversation about racial inequality in the United States. In both cases, grand juries declined to indict the officers involved. The rulings provoked a wave of protest marches, rallies, and road blockades across the country, as demonstrators of all skin colors proclaimed to the nation and to the world that “black lives matter.”"
8,The Failure of Multiculturalism,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/western-europe/2015-02-18/failure-multiculturalism,The Failure of Multiculturalism,"Thirty years ago, many Europeans saw multiculturalism—the embrace of an inclusive, diverse society—as an answer to Europe’s social problems. Today, a growing number consider it to be a cause of them. That perception has led some mainstream politicians, including British Prime Minister David Cameron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, to publicly denounce multiculturalism and speak out against its dangers. It has fueled the success of far-right parties and populist politicians across Europe, from the Party for Freedom in the Netherlands to the National Front in France. And in the most extreme cases, it has inspired obscene acts of violence, such as Anders Behring Breivik’s homicidal rampage on the Norwegian island of Utoya in July 2011."
9,Does Race Matter in Latin America?,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/south-america/2015-02-16/does-race-matter-latin-america,Does Race Matter in Latin America?,"In 1992, the Nobel Committee awarded its Peace Prize to Rigoberta Menchú Tum, the daughter of poor Guatemalan peasants, for her work promoting indigenous rights. Her prize, momentous in its own right, highlighted a sea change in Latin American politics. Throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, prominent indigenous movements had emerged in countries such as Bolivia, Ecuador, Guatemala, and Mexico. As a result, Latin American countries undertook unprecedented reforms to address ethnic diversity: politicians amended national constitutions to recognize indigenous people, passed laws supporting bicultural education and affirmative action, and added questions about race and ethnicity to official censuses. Today, indigenous people not only are actively involved in politics but also have risen to leadership positions. Evo Morales, an indigenous Bolivian, has served as his country’s president since 2006. Ollanta Humala, an indigenous Peruvian, became Peru’s president in 2011."
10,Race in the Modern World,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2015-03-01/race-modern-world,Race in the Modern World,"In 1900, in his “Address to the Nations of the World” at the first Pan-African Conference, in London, W. E. B. Du Bois proclaimed that the “problem of the twentieth century” was “the problem of the color-line, the question as to how far differences of race—which show themselves chiefly in the color of the skin and the texture of the hair—will hereafter be made the basis of denying to over half the world the right of sharing to their utmost ability the opportunities and privileges of modern civilization.” Du Bois had in mind not just race relations in the United States but also the role race played in the European colonial schemes that were then still reshaping Africa and Asia. The final British conquest of Kumasi, Ashanti’s capital (and the town in Ghana where I grew up), had occurred just a week before the London conference began. The British did not defeat the Sokoto caliphate in northern Nigeria until 1903. Morocco did not become a French protectorate until 1912, Egypt did not become a British one until 1914, and Ethiopia did not lose its independence until 1936. Notions of race played a crucial role in all these events, and following the Congress of Berlin in 1878, during which the great powers began to devise a world order for the modern era, the status of the subject peoples in the Belgian, British, French, German, Spanish, and Portuguese colonies of Africa—as well as in independent South Africa—was defined explicitly in racial terms. Du Bois was the beneficiary of the best education that North Atlantic civilization had to offer: he had studied at Fisk, one of the United States’ finest black colleges; at Harvard; and at the University of Berlin. The year before his address, he had published The Philadelphia Negro, the first detailed sociological study of an American community. And like practically everybody else in his era, he had absorbed the notion, spread by a wide range of European and American intellectuals over the course of the nineteenth century, that race—the division of the world into distinct groups, identifiable by the new biological sciences—was central to social, cultural, and political life. Group thinker: Du Bois in Washington, D.C., circa 1911."
11,Apartheid’s Long Shadow,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/south-africa/2015-02-10/apartheid-s-long-shadow,Apartheid’s Long Shadow,"Last April, South Africa celebrated the 20th anniversary of its first democratic elections, which brought to power the African National Congress (ANC) and its leader, Nelson Mandela, who had led the antiapartheid movement for decades. Many had long believed that civil war was the only way that the apartheid state would fall, and South Africa’s mostly peaceful transition from a racist authoritarian state to a multiracial democracy stands as one of the most surprising political developments of the twentieth century. The shift has not been without its problems, but few would contest South Africa’s credentials as a democracy—perhaps the most democratic state in Africa."
12,Does Affirmative Action Work?,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2015-03-01/does-affirmative-action-work,Does Affirmative Action Work?,"Americans tend to think of affirmative action as a uniquely American institution: an outgrowth of the civil rights movement, intended primarily to improve economic opportunities for African Americans, who have continued to face obstacles to equality long after the Jim Crow era of segregation and overt discrimination. And it is true that as part of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the U.S. government began to implement affirmative action policies. State agencies and public universities soon followed suit. As these programs expanded to assist other groups, such as women, Native Americans, and Hispanic Americans, affirmative action began to seem like a strategy specifically suited to a Western liberal democracy struggling to reconcile its ideals with its history."
13,Obama’s Libya Debacle,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/libya/2019-02-18/obamas-libya-debacle,Obama’s Libya Debacle,"On March 17, 2011, the UN Security Council passed Resolution 1973, spearheaded by the administration of U.S. President Barack Obama, authorizing military intervention in Libya. The goal, Obama explained, was to save the lives of peaceful, pro-democracy protesters who found themselves the target of a crackdown by Libyan dictator Muammar al-Qaddafi. Not only did Qaddafi endanger the momentum of the nascent Arab Spring, which had recently swept away authoritarian regimes in Tunisia and Egypt, but he also was poised to commit a bloodbath in the Libyan city where the uprising had started, said the president. “We knew that if we waited one more day, Benghazi—a city nearly the size of Charlotte—could suffer a massacre that would have reverberated across the region and stained the conscience of the world,” Obama declared. Two days after the UN authorization, the United States and other NATO countries established a no-fly zone throughout Libya and started bombing Qaddafi’s forces. Seven months later, in October 2011, after an extended military campaign with sustained Western support, rebel forces conquered the country and shot Qaddafi dead."
14,ISIS Is Not a Terrorist Group,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/middle-east/2015-02-18/isis-not-terrorist-group,ISIS Is Not a Terrorist Group,"After 9/11, many within the U.S. national security establishment worried that, following decades of preparation for confronting conventional enemies, Washington was unready for the challenge posed by an unconventional adversary such as al Qaeda. So over the next decade, the United States built an elaborate bureaucratic structure to fight the jihadist organization, adapting its military and its intelligence and law enforcement agencies to the tasks of counterterrorism and counterinsurgency."
15,Disrupting the Intelligence Community,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2015-03-01/disrupting-intelligence-community,Disrupting the Intelligence Community,"Some 40 years have passed since the Church Committee’s sweeping investigation of U.S. intelligence practices, fresh on the heels of the Watergate scandal. And ten years have gone by since the last major reorganization of the country’s spy agencies, enacted in the wake of 9/11. Both efforts led to a host of reforms—among them, the creation of the Senate and House Intelligence Committees, the passage of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), and the adoption of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act, which I helped shepherd through Congress."
16,Can Economists Learn?,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/2015-02-16/can-economists-learn,Can Economists Learn?,"Is it acceptable for a reviewer to complain about a book’s title? I hope so, because this one is pretty misleading. A number of valuable lessons can indeed be gleaned from the two and a half dozen essays that compose this quite interesting volume, but the book’s subject is described far more accurately by the title of the April 2013 International Monetary Fund conference that spawned it: “Rethinking Macro Policy II: First Steps and Early Lessons.” (Yes, there was a “Rethinking Macro Policy I,” which resulted in an earlier MIT Press volume.)"
17,Class and the Classroom,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/review-essay/2015-03-01/class-and-classroom,Class and the Classroom,"One of the most fruitful ideas to emerge from twentieth-century social theory is Max Weber’s notion of the “iron cage” of purposive rationality. Weber argued that once some principle of organization—market competition, say, or ideological orthodoxy—has achieved dominance in the spheres of production and governance, the rest of a society’s institutions find themselves gradually but inexorably adopting the same principle. In an ideology-dominant society, everything fluid turns to stone; in a market-dominant society, everything solid melts into air."
18,The Resistible Rise of Vladimir Putin,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/resistible-rise-vladimir-putin,The Resistible Rise of Vladimir Putin,"How did twenty-first-century Russia end up, yet again, in personal rule? An advanced industrial country of 142 million people, it has no enduring political parties that organize and respond to voter preferences. The military is sprawling yet tame; the immense secret police are effectively in one man’s pocket. The hydrocarbon sector is a personal bank, and indeed much of the economy is increasingly treated as an individual fiefdom. Mass media move more or less in lockstep with the commands of the presidential administration. Competing interest groups abound, but there is no rival center of power. In late October 2014, after a top aide to Russia’s president told the annual forum of the Valdai Discussion Club, which brings together Russian and foreign experts, that Russians understand “if there is no Putin, there is no Russia,” the pundit Stanislav Belkovsky observed that “the search for Russia’s national idea, which began after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, is finally over. Now, it is evident that Russia’s national idea is Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin.”"
19,Why Counterinsurgency Doesn't Work,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2015-02-16/why-counterinsurgency-doesnt-work,Why Counterinsurgency Doesn’t Work,"Both Max Boot (“More Small Wars,” November/December 2014) and Rick Brennan (“Withdrawal Symptoms,” November/December 2014) provide insight into what the United States did wrong at an operational level in Iraq. Boot’s precepts for doing better in the next counterinsurgency are sensible, even if some of them would require a higher tolerance for casualties, and Brennan’s arguments about the errors the United States committed in Iraq from 2010 to 2012 generally ring true to me, as one of the people making some of those mistakes."
20,Germany’s Real Role in the Ukraine Crisis,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/eastern-europe-caucasus/germanys-real-role-ukraine-crisis,Germany’s Real Role in the Ukraine Crisis,"In his discussion of German foreign policy’s supposed drift eastward, Hans Kundnani (“Leaving the West Behind,” January/February 2015) suggests that Germany has resisted imposing sanctions on Russia over its undeclared war with Ukraine—a sign, in his view, that Germany might once again desert the West in a flirtation with Russia. That interpretation is little more than an urban legend. True, German Chancellor Angela Merkel has resisted blunt sanctions and has taken every opportunity to negotiate with Moscow in her efforts to de-escalate the fighting in Ukraine. But her approach is supporting sanctions, not opposing them—and it certainly is not appeasing Moscow."
21,How to Deter China,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2015-02-16/how-deter-china,How to Deter China,"In the U.S. military, at least, the “pivot” to Asia has begun. By 2020, the navy and the air force plan to base 60 percent of their forces in the Asia-Pacific region. The Pentagon, meanwhile, is investing a growing share of its shrinking resources in new long-range bombers and nuclear-powered submarines designed to operate in high-threat environments."
22,Power Politics in Zimbabwe,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2015-02-16/power-politics-zimbabwe,Power Politics in Zimbabwe,"Frequent predictions of the demise of President Robert Mugabe and Zimbabwe’s collapse have underestimated Mugabe’s political abilities and staying power and the support he enjoys among Zimbabweans. In his transformation from liberator to tyrant, Mugabe has managed to ride out even the worst self-inflicted economic storms, including hyperinflation. As Bratton’s fine book documents, Mugabe’s grip on power relies on a patronage-ridden political economy, the efficient authoritarianism of his ruling party, a weak and confused opposition, and a conspiracy of silence among regional leaders, especially in South Africa, who have long refused to denounce Mugabe. This portrait of Harare’s own Machiavelli is quite timely: in recent months, Mugabe has orchestrated a purge of sorts, casting out a number of longtime loyalists and paving the way for the rise of his own wife, Grace, and that of a close ally, Emmerson Mnangagwa, who now seems to be his most likely successor. A perplexing aspect of the Mugabe story is why so many Zimbabweans, perhaps even a majority, continue to support a regime that has done them so much harm. Even for an astute analyst such as Bratton, this remains a puzzle. Bratton, a Zimbabwean himself, writes that he would like to eventually return to Zimbabwe, but absent a “genuine political settlement,” this remains a dream deferred. His analysis suggests that the country will continue to muddle through and that a change in leadership is likely only to perpetuate, rather than reform, the country’s perverse politics."
23,"Diasporas, Development, and Peacemaking in the Horn of Africa",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2015-02-16/diasporas-development-and-peacemaking-horn-africa,"Diasporas, Development, and Peacemaking in the Horn of Africa","Many observers have noted that diaspora communities often provide manpower, funding, and logistical support to radical or violent groups in low-income, war-torn countries. This collection of essays focuses on the interaction of diaspora groups and the countries of the Horn of Africa and paints a more nuanced picture. Decades of conflict in the region have driven significant populations of Eritreans, Ethiopians, and Somalis to Europe, the Gulf states, and North America. Laakso and Hautaniemi reveal that these expatriates typically interact with their countries of origin with parochial objectives in mind; they usually want to aid their home villages or regions rather than influence national politics. But even when they seek only to promote economic and social welfare, their activities can have unintended political effects—and not necessarily bad ones. For instance, the authors argue that during the mid-1990s, expatriate funding for major construction projects in Somaliland helped jump-start postconflict rebuilding in that autonomous region of Somalia. Several interesting chapters also investigate the role that diaspora communities play in shaping how Western development agencies understand the countries of the Horn of Africa, sometimes in a manner that benefits members of the diasporas themselves."
24,"Oil, Democracy, and Development in Africa",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2015-02-16/oil-democracy-and-development-africa,"Oil, Democracy, and Development in Africa","Heilbrunn’s well-informed book disputes the conventional wisdom that oil wealth represents a “resource curse” for countries in Africa. To be sure, his detailed reports of corruption, messy politics, and incompetent leadership in the continent’s dozen or so oil-producing states suggest that oil has not always aided the cause of political and social development—to put it mildly. But Heilbrunn argues that colonialism left these countries extremely vulnerable to the negative effects of oil wealth. He also provides evidence that the revenues from oil have in fact promoted some economic growth and some meaningful state building. His analysis is buttressed by thorough accounts of the oil sectors in each country and the state organizations that have developed during the last five decades to manage the oil wealth. In the book’s most striking claim, he argues that over time, middle classes created by the oil wealth have become significant voices on behalf of democracy in countries such as Angola and Nigeria."
25,Ragged Glory: The Rainbow Nation in Black and White,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2015-02-16/ragged-glory-rainbow-nation-black-and-white,Ragged Glory: The Rainbow Nation in Black and White,"More than 20 years have elapsed since Nelson Mandela’s inauguration as president of South Africa ushered in the postapartheid era. At the time, few observers predicted an easy path for a country with such a violent history and such enormous inequalities. Over the next decade, however, a relatively smooth transition to democracy and Mandela’s enormous personal appeal heightened expectations both inside and outside South Africa. It was almost inevitable that the government led by Mandela’s party, the African National Congress, would fail to meet those hopes. Hartley, a prominent South African political journalist, skillfully tells this story of emerging dissatisfaction. His authoritative account covers, among other things, the disastrous AIDS policy of Mandela’s successor as president, Thabo Mbeki; the various financial scandals that the senior ANC leadership has allowed to corrode public faith in government; and the poorly conceived, badly implemented economic policies that have resulted in mediocre economic growth and little change in prevailing levels of socioeconomic inequality."
26,Africa’s Development in Historical Perspective,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2015-02-16/africas-development-historical-perspective,Africa’s Development in Historical Perspective,"Why is sub-Saharan Africa the poorest region of the world? In this collection, a group of eminent economic historians investigates the most plausible answers to that question. Generally erudite and authoritative, the volume is essential reading for anyone interested in African development or in growth theory more generally. The essays consider the geographic constraints undermining Africa; the institutional, political, and cultural obstacles to economic growth in the region; and the devastating impacts of colonialism and the slave trade. The book presents a wide range of views on the root causes of the area’s persistent woes, and the editors wisely recognize that none of these explanations are mutually exclusive. Indeed, by the end of the book, the region’s poverty seems almost overdetermined, even though the contributions emphasize the variation in each country’s economic path. The impact of colonialism varies from country to country, for example, and some countries have been harmed more than others by factors such as endemic malaria and the legacy of slavery."
27,Civil Society Under Authoritarianism: The China Model,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2015-02-16/civil-society-under-authoritarianism-china-model,Civil Society Under Authoritarianism: The China Model,"The emergence of a large middle class in China has produced a demand for more citizen participation. The government has responded with a set of practices that it labels “consultative democracy” but that Teets more accurately describes as “consultative authoritarianism.” Volunteer organizations are allowed to work in areas such as public health, environmental protection, education reform, and disaster relief, but they must focus on service delivery rather than policy advocacy. This boundary is enforced through tax audits, police interrogations, and deregistrations of groups suspected of crossing the line; arrests are seldom necessary. These baby steps toward civil society benefit the government by producing information about emerging social problems and by giving officials the opportunity to learn from policy experiments. Teets’ findings point up a dilemma for international donors who hope to make China more democratic by funding civil society organizations. Such groups might help China move toward what the regime calls “big society, small government,” but that might be only a more sustainable form of one-party rule."
28,Middle Powers and the Rise of China,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2015-02-16/middle-powers-and-rise-china,Middle Powers and the Rise of China,"The power shift between the United States and China is often misunderstood as a two-player drama. This book draws attention to the 20 or so “middle powers”—countries such as Australia, Indonesia, South Korea, and Turkey—that have as much to gain or lose as the two main actors. The contributors argue that instead of bandwagoning with a rising power, middle powers have historically tried to mediate conflicts, promote multipolarity, and strengthen the role of international norms and institutions. The eight country case studies collected here, which also include Brazil, Malaysia, South Africa, and Thailand, confirm that today’s middle powers are mostly behaving according to this model. They often try to distinguish themselves with “niche diplomacy,” in areas such as peacekeeping, foreign aid, and the environment, and to increase their influence through regional organizations such as the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. Although these middle powers try to ward off excessive influence from either major power, their policy preferences overlap more with Washington’s interests than with Beijing’s."
29,"Strategy in Asia: The Past, Present, and Future of Regional Security",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2015-02-16/strategy-asia-past-present-and-future-regional-security,"Strategy in Asia: The Past, Present, and Future of Regional Security","The most interesting chapters in this collection reflect on how geography affects the war-fighting options of Asian states. The region includes the mountain ranges of South Asia, the deserts of Central Asia, and the rivers of Southeast Asia. But several contributors agree that the crucial strategic domain today is the series of seas stretching along the Chinese coast that are hemmed in by the so-called first island chain. Twenty-two militarily crucial straits and channels constrain the ability of the Chinese navy to project its power into the wider Pacific. Because the islands in the South China Sea are too small to support substantial forward deployments, the regional arms race focuses on longer-range missiles, submarines, and more powerful ships, including the much-heralded first Chinese aircraft carrier, introduced in 2012; Japanese helicopter carriers; and an upgraded Indian carrier force. Other chapters explore the strategic significance of national war-fighting cultures; nuclear deterrence; irregular warfare in India, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka; and the constraints that the region’s unusually high level of economic interdependence places on warfare."
30,Qiaowu: Extra-Territorial Policies for the Overseas Chinese,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2015-02-16/qiaowu-extra-territorial-policies-overseas-chinese,Qiaowu: Extra-Territorial Policies for the Overseas Chinese,"China’s outreach to the tens of millions of ethnic Chinese living abroad—the world’s largest diaspora—is an often overlooked part of the country’s soft-power strategy, but it is as careful and well organized as the other parts. To’s exhaustively researched book shows how the Overseas Chinese Affairs Office cultivates support in diaspora communities through language programs, cultural events, specialized media, summer camps, “roots-seeking” tours, long-term residence permits, and special business opportunities—an outreach effort known in Chinese as qiaowu. A policy adopted in the 1950s to limit consular protection to Chinese nationals abroad has quietly changed, with China increasingly helping co-ethnics who are not Chinese citizens. As To points out, the success of such efforts can be measured by the way sentiment toward China among overseas Chinese swung from revulsion during the 1989 Tiananmen crackdown to fervent pride during the 2008 Beijing Olympics. Of course, China takes a much different approach to elements of the diaspora that oppose the regime, including political dissidents, Tibetan and Uighur activists, and Falun Gong practitioners: rather than seeking to protect and aid such groups, Chinese operatives surveil, threaten, and, on rare occasions, kidnap them."
31,Hun Sen’s Cambodia,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2015-02-16/hun-sens-cambodia,Hun Sen’s Cambodia,"The metaphor of a mirage recurs in Strangio’s well-reported book. In Cambodia, democracy is a mirage; so are constitutionalism, civil society, the rule of law, transitional justice, poverty reduction, media freedom, and environmental conservation. The UN and foreign donors have committed billions of dollars and exported thousands of personnel to Cambodia to create these illusions since the end of the brutal Khmer Rouge regime in 1979, but they have failed to turn them into realities. What remains real are violence, corruption, income polarization, land grabbing, and environmental devastation. Yet, as Strangio shows, the country is enjoying an economic boom, and a Cambodian middle class is emerging. A great deal of blame for the tragedies and some credit for the successes go to Hun Sen, the country’s dominant politician since 1985, whom the book vividly portrays as a man of great intelligence, energy, and political skill—and also as a control freak and an amoral pragmatist whose guiding principle is “Know reality.” Despite a surprising rebuke to Hun Sen’s party in the 2013 National Assembly elections, Chinese support for Hun Sen—combined with waning Western interest—is likely to guarantee that business as usual will continue for the foreseeable future."
32,Patronage as Politics in South Asia; Religious Practice and Democracy in India,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2015-02-16/patronage-politics-south-asia-religious-practice-and-democracy,Patronage as Politics in South Asia; Religious Practice and Democracy in India,"Given India’s deep divisions along caste, class, regional, and religious lines, the stability of the country’s democracy is puzzling. Piliavsky’s contributors, most of whom are anthropologists, offer fresh insights into the ways in which religious feasts, patronage handouts, and petty bureaucratic favors both support and undermine the state. Their essays, of varying quality, push back against the conventional interpretation of patronage as a merely instrumental form of exchange, revealing it as a performance of social values, in which patrons demonstrate their generosity and clients prove their loyalty. But generosity requires resources, so another game is surely going on underneath such displays, as the patron turns votes into power and power into patronage. The public admires such behavior when it appears to be a form of benevolence and considers patronage democratic when it appears to support accountability—but revile it as corrupt when its instrumental purposes emerge too starkly. Still, as long as common norms legitimate patronage, voters will continue to elect corrupt politicians."
33,Palestine: The Legitimacy of Hope,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2015-02-16/palestine-legitimacy-hope,Palestine: The Legitimacy of Hope,"For decades, Falk was a professor of international relations and international law at Princeton University. Between 2008 and 2014, he was the UN Human Rights Council’s special rapporteur on Palestinian human rights. This book collects blog posts that Falk wrote during that time, and it is an unapologetic indictment of Israel—a country that, according to Falk, evinces racist and even genocidal instincts. He accuses Israel of practicing collective punishment, especially against the people of Gaza. U.S. policymakers are in thrall to Israel and underwrite its practices; the rest of the world, Falk urges, need not and should not do so. He sees the Palestinians as waging a war for legitimacy, in which they must deploy the weapons of international law that Israel and the United States have denied them; the law, he contends, will be the great equalizer. Unfortunately, Falk does not consider the other “equalizers” deployed by Hamas and Hezbollah: unconventional war and terrorism. The book will be dismissed by some as an anti-Semitic screed. That would be unfair. Stripped of its provocative rhetoric, Falk’s book describes a basic reality."
34,Gaza: A History,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2015-02-16/gaza-history,Gaza: A History,"This is a big book about a small place: the Gaza Strip, sometimes referred to as the world’s largest open-air prison. Filiu confirms that image in meticulous, sometimes numbing detail. This is a chronological political history, devoid of social and economic history. Gaza’s population grew from 35,000 in 1948 to over 1.5 million today. Filiu barely addresses the question of how the strip has accommodated all that growth. Instead, he narrates the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, violent blow by violent blow, through the prism of Gaza’s internal politics. His primary argument is that despite Israel’s attempts to repress Hamas in Gaza, the Israelis have undercut the credibility of moderate Palestinian leaders, such as Yasir Arafat and Mahmoud Abbas. By unilaterally withdrawing from Lebanon in 2000 and from Gaza in 2005, Israel signaled that the occupation could best be resisted through violence, not negotiation. Recent discussion in Tel Aviv and Washington of a “West Bank–only” solution is detached from reality, he argues: “Peace between Israel and Palestine can assume neither meaning nor substance except in Gaza.”"
35,In This Arab Time: The Pursuit of Deliverance,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2015-02-16/arab-time-pursuit-deliverance,In This Arab Time: The Pursuit of Deliverance,"Ajami, who passed away last year, was seen as an enfant terrible by some Western academics and many Arab intellectuals because he often eschewed the methods of social science and espoused witheringly critical views of his own people. His belief that Arabs have often been “the authors of their own demise,” as he put it, enraged many because it downplayed the role of outside forces, especially Israel and the United States, in the struggles of Arab peoples and countries. Yet Ajami was also fascinated by and gloried in the Arab world’s rich intellectual and cultural history. The essays in this rich collection are frequently inspired by the novels, poems, and films of great Arab artists. And for a thinker who enjoyed occasionally treading the corridors of power in Washington, Ajami is often dismissive or critical of U.S. policy in the Middle East. Perhaps when Ajami did manage to capture the truth, it was owing to his status as something of an outsider in both the Arab world and the Western one."

She grew up with the Islamic Revolution and later became a correspondent for The New York Times. In this intimate memoir, she situates the revolution and the rise of the theocracy in a long series of events: the anti-British Tobacco Protest of the 1890s, the constitutionalist movement of 1905–6, and the premiership of Mohammad Mosaddeq in the early 1950s, which ended in a royalist coup backed by the Americans and the British. In her view, the Islamic Revolution—which she believes effectively ended around 2000—represented a step backward on a convoluted but certain path to a more liberal, democratic Iran. She points out that in some ways, the clerical regime might have planted the seeds of its own eventual undoing by providing for women’s education and by overseeing the growth of a vast new urban middle class. As she sees it, the so-called Green Movement, with its massive protests in the wake of the allegedly rigged 2009 reelection of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, was a harbinger of Iran’s future."

But Hezbollah is a powerful military force, political party, business conglomerate, and provider of social services, and the book does not adequately weigh the relative importance of propaganda in maintaining the group’s influence. And although the authors provide a useful review of Hezbollah’s messaging and image-making—analyzing its speeches, videos, and poetry—they provide little information about the impact that such propaganda has had on different audiences. They also focus almost exclusively on the words of Hassan Nasrallah, Hezbollah’s secretary-general, excluding other sources of the group’s public communications. Finally, the book’s conclusion too briefly explores how Hezbollah has placed itself in a precarious position by supporting the Assad regime in Syria, jeopardizing its image as an independent Lebanese party and as a paragon of pan-Islamic and pan-Arab ideals."

In the authors’ view, “the middle ground” is where Shiite leadership is most comfortable. It is a gray zone in which absolute truths exist but are seen as unobtainable and where managing “friction” between strategies and values—and allies and adversaries—is the essence of leadership. The authors don’t quite explain how this differs from the tensions among pragmatism, dogmatism, and idealism that all political leaders confront. In any event, they see Iran’s first supreme leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, as the master of the middle ground; by contrast, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, Iran’s president from 2005 to 2013, sought to rule Iran according to his own black-and-white ideals. Mishal and Goldberg see the liberals of the Green Movement, who protested the alleged vote rigging that led to Ahmadinejad’s reelection in 2009, as defenders of the Khomeinist status quo. In more provocative passages, they suggest that Sunni-led political systems are inherently centralized, hierarchical, and unaccommodating of the middle ground."

Popular protests against corruption, government waste, and dismal public services engulfed the country in 2013. And last year, a former official of the national oil company, Petrobras, revealed a massive bribery scheme that funneled money from the company to the ruling coalition of President Dilma Rousseff. Yet despite this economic turmoil and political scandal, Brazilians recently reelected Rousseff to a second term. Reid’s book will help readers grasp the confounding cycles of Brazilian politics. In past writings, Reid, a columnist and writer-at-large on Latin American issues for The Economist, might have been too bullish on Brazil’s prospects. But this compelling account of the country’s history, stretching back to the arrival of the Portuguese in 1500, represents the most thoughtful and balanced recent assessment of Brazil’s enormous triumphs and crushing failures, and of what lies ahead for Latin America’s most populous country and the world’s seventh-largest economy."

But Rein, an Argentine Israeli historian, paints a very different picture of Argentina during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, when the South American nation opened its doors to European Jews. Having escaped the pogroms and poverty of eastern Europe, Jews in Argentina looked to the national pastime of soccer as an avenue for integration into a prosperous and dynamic society. By participating in soccer as players, members of athletic clubs, or mere spectators, Argentine Jews challenged Old World stereotypes of Jewish weakness and frailty. In particular, Rein shows that the soccer team Atlanta, which represented the Villa Crespo neighborhood of Buenos Aires and its relatively large Jewish population, came to be identified as a Jewish club and served as an object of Jewish pride—not unlike the Brooklyn Dodgers in the United States. Rein also salutes Juan Péron, who served as president of Argentina in the 1940s and 1950s, for promoting sports as a vehicle for creating a modern and progressive national consciousness as well as a means of upward social mobility.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

Vintage photos capture a tanned Senator John F. Kennedy relaxing in a bathing suit, a stunning Marilyn Monroe honeymooning with Arthur Miller in Jamaica, and young Bianca and Mick Jagger at a costume ball in Mustique. Escape is a handsome coffee-table book—but also much more. The text is remarkably sophisticated, and the archival photographs are wonderfully revealing. Mallea places these glamorous escapes in their historical context: they developed owing to Prohibition in the United States, to political upheaval that drove pleasure seekers to the relative stability of the Caribbean, and to innovative technologies that allowed luxury steamships and trains to transform Havana into “New York’s gayest suburb.” A native of Cuba, Mallea showcases architectural gems that were often designed by leading Western architects and reproduced European styles but that were also embedded in local environments. These flamboyant structures allowed the wealthy to escape the social constraints of home yet remain safely ensconced among fellow elites."

Some 450,000 Cubans, or about ten percent of the active work force, quickly took advantage of the new policy, opening private restaurants and bed-and-breakfasts, setting up taxi companies and beauty parlors, and offering their services in construction and electronics repair. In Entrepreneurial Cuba, two veteran Cuba watchers, the social scientists Ritter and Henken, interview many of these new business owners, detail the regulations governing their activities, and calculate the effective tax rates they pay. Particularly valuable are the chapters on the remaining underground economy—businesses not yet able or willing to come out of the shadows—and the contributors’ judicious assessments of the new regulations governing the still forming but promising worker-managed cooperative sector. Overall, the authors recognize the significance of Raúl’s reforms while finding them insufficient to pull the Cuban economy out of its doldrums. Certainly, Ritter and Henken would applaud U.S. President Barack Obama’s recent decision to authorize U.S. firms to engage with Cuba’s new entrepreneurs."

Yet the interpretation he puts forward, although shared by many in the European financial and political establishments, is hardly uncontroversial. In Cline’s view, the euro system is in crisis primarily because some eurozone members have accumulated too much sovereign debt, and not because Europe suffers from insufficient demand, distorted exchange rates, or a lack of economic competitiveness. Cline argues that it would be disastrous for any country—even Greece, whose economic woes are currently dragging down the rest of the EU—to exit the eurozone because of the risk that investors would soon lose confidence in other countries. Thus, the EU’s current response represents the only feasible option: Greece should continue to receive some modest debt relief from creditors and the EU, and Greece and other indebted EU countries, including Ireland, Italy, and Portugal, should continue to run large fiscal surpluses indefinitely. Cline’s empirical analysis is impressive, but skeptics will note that his conclusions rest on two speculative assumptions: running perpetual surpluses will not stunt economic growth, and any withdrawal from the euro would be so costly as to make such threats not worth taking seriously. Recent events in Europe seem to be calling both of those assumptions into question.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

He was also a trenchant and insightful essayist. This book collects his best work in that genre. Profound and prescient, these short, readable pieces cover a range of topics: the meaning of the Cold War and its end; Israel’s relationship to the Holocaust; the world order after 9/11; the lives of great thinkers; and the decline of European systems and institutions, from railroads to social democracy. Underlying these topics is a set of Judt’s deeper concerns—Judt’s editor calls them “obsessions”—including the changing role of the state, the ideological purposes of foreign policy, the role of memory in public life, and the enduring effects of history. Were all that not enough, this book would still be worth reading solely for Judt’s widow’s description of the historian’s rigorous work habits—an account that definitively counters the myth that talented writers achieve greatness effortlessly.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

This book examines what actually happens when a government secures an opt-out, as Denmark, Ireland, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and others have done on issues such as social policy, border controls, the euro, defense, and asylum and immigration. The academic theory and language in this book are unnecessarily complex, yet its basic point is important: opt-outs can actually strengthen the EU. They aid progress by permitting the union to move ahead on vital policies, preventing individual members from gumming up the works. Once those policies are in place, they often become so important that the states that have opted out find quiet ways to become as involved as their domestic politics will permit. On the surface, the EU might seem to be a legalistic body, but, as this book demonstrates, its true decision-making and enforcement processes are based on unwritten norms.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

Sarotte argues that the opening of the wall was “accidental and contingent.” It was certainly unforeseen and unintended by world leaders. Neither Soviet Premier Mikhail Gorbachev, who sought to reform Soviet communism, nor U.S. President Ronald Reagan, who a few years previously had called on Gorbachev to “tear down this wall,” really expected that East Germany would open up. Leaders in East Berlin never issued a definitive order to allow people to pass through; rather, their contradictory commands freed border guards to act autonomously. Yet the book also shows—somewhat contrary to Sarotte’s thesis—that the fall of the wall reflected deeper, perhaps inevitable historical trends. By late 1989, neither the Soviet government nor the East German authorities were willing to use force to block the changes unfolding in Berlin. Sarotte’s blow-by-blow account tells readers much about how events developed on that fateful night, but less about how the Soviet bloc had reached the point of no return."

The new book focuses on the years since 2005, examining the people, bureaucratic arrangements, and policy disputes that have shaped statecraft during the George W. Bush and Obama administrations. The insightful result is often critical of both presidents and their teams. Rothkopf generally affirms the view that the Bush administration was too assertive in its policies after 9/11, although he also discusses some of Bush’s now-forgotten successes, such as his handling of relations with rising powers such as Brazil and India, and notes that a more experienced and better-supported Bush compiled a much more solid diplomatic record in his second term. When Rothkopf criticizes Barack Obama, he generally faults the president for being too passive on foreign policy rather than too active. Rothkopf does credit Obama with some achievements, such as the successful hunt for Osama bin Laden and the decimation of the core al Qaeda organization, but he argues that in general the administration has failed to follow a coherent strategy for dealing with profound global upheaval."

Cronin follows the story of that relationship into the next era with a deeply researched and lucid history of the period between the Vietnam War and the present day. Cronin argues that the United Kingdom and the United States worked together to stabilize the world order after the dislocations of the 1970s and then to establish the foundations of a new order after the end of the Cold War. What drew the two powers together was not just a shared set of economic and political ideas but also a common view of the importance of an international financial architecture and a mutual commitment to creating a single global order (as opposed to a set of regional orders). Cronin does not think that the British will play an equivalent role the next time the world order is shaken to its core, but neither does he foresee a quick end to the post–Cold War order co-created by British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and U.S. President George H. W. Bush. Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

In Holzer’s remarkably readable and entertaining book, readers see a young Abraham Lincoln scheming to get his name in the New York press; working with friendly editors to orchestrate favorable press coverage of his 1860 campaign for the presidency; and then, once in office, trying to manipulate and at times to censor and control the press during the Civil War. Many of today’s Internet-era journalists are weary of constant technological upheaval and yearn for simpler times; their Civil War–era counterparts would sympathize. During the nineteenth century, revolutions in printing and communications technology, such as the development of the telegraph, repeatedly upended the news business.

Davis, a West Point graduate who fought in the Mexican-American War and later served as U.S. secretary of war, tried to micromanage the Confederate war effort but had little success. He maintained a model civil-military partnership with Robert E. Lee, who commanded the Army of Northern Virginia, the Confederacy’s main army in the east, but his relationships with most of his other commanders were poisoned by mistrust. Davis never developed an effective vision for how the Confederacy could win the war and never found a workable strategy for how to defend Confederate territory west of the Appalachians. Nevertheless, McPherson is kinder to his subject than many of Davis’ contemporary critics were, and he argues convincingly that most of Davis’ major strategic decisions were sound. There was never much chance that the Confederacy would win the war; in McPherson’s account, Davis’ biggest strategic blunder was to accept the offer to become its president in the first place.

Mark Twain published The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn in 1884—a time not unlike the present, Levy argues, when authorities in the United States sought to strictly regulate the behavior of young people at the same time as they were dismantling racially progressive policies and laws that had emerged after the Civil War. Twain, Levy argues, was a progressive nostalgist, and Huckleberry Finn, with its tale of a wayward boy who befriends a runaway slave, was a protest against the loss of juvenile freedom and the collapse of racial understanding. Twain pined for an era during which, he believed, young people had been less regimented by church and school and race relations had been more open (slavery notwithstanding). In a deft and skillful piece of cultural analysis, Levy argues that the minstrel shows of the 1840s and 1850s, which sometimes subverted racial pre-judices through jokes that reversed conventional roles and emphasized the common foibles of both blacks and whites, served as models for Twain’s novel."

Indeed, the simple, familiar aphorisms of The Art of War—so frequently cited in Western literature on war and strategy—obscure complex patterns of thought with deep roots in Chinese culture. Yuen puts Sun-tzu in context, identifying his debts to Chinese philosophy (particularly Taoism), providing historical background, guiding the reader through the key themes in his work, explaining common interpretations of it, and detailing its reception in the West. Yuen presents Sun-tzu’s view of strategic thought as holistic and nonlinear. This is not a book for the faint-hearted or for those skeptical about Sun-tzu’s approach to strategy. But anyone who wishes to understand Sun-tzu should not ignore it."

Although such a force can survive and even grow during a guerrilla war, to achieve victory, it must use political as much as military action to transform itself into something resembling a conventional army acting on behalf of something resembling a state. Mao developed this formula in the 1930s, and it was the basis for his success and, later, for the success of the Vietnamese Communists and others his movement inspired. Mao’s victory proved to be something of a tipping point: Katagiri shows that before the late 1940s, most insurgencies failed; since Mao’s victory, most insurgencies following his methods have succeeded. Katagiri uses a range of interesting case studies, including wars of colonization and wars of liberation, to develop what he calls “sequencing theory”—the order in which insurgents must take certain steps in order to prevail—and to draw conclusions for counterinsurgency.

Most readers will find their favorite war movies discussed in Jeansonne and Luhrssen’s book, from All Quiet on the Western Front to Casablanca to The Hurt Locker. The research is diligent, the judgments measured, and the writing clear, and yet this book feels like a bit of a missed opportunity. The authors allude to big questions but don’t fully develop their answers, and the conclusion is perfunctory. The role of Gallipoli in helping shape Australia’s national identity is described, but despite the book’s subtitle, much more remains to be said about the way war films—especially those of Steven Spielberg—have influenced Americans’ self-images. The book doesn’t mention British complaints about how Hollywood has exaggerated the American part in winning World War II, and such iconic British movies as The Dam Busters and The Cruel Sea are ignored. On the other hand, the authors do explore how the James Bond films have encouraged the myth that the United Kingdom served as a great source of undercover operatives during the Cold War."

It was a bold move, aiming to catch the complacent Allies unaware by driving toward the port of Antwerp through the Ardennes. Total victory was no longer in the cards for Germany, but Hitler believed that if he could split the British and U.S. forces, disrupting their logistics and undermining their morale, it might allow him to press for a negotiated peace rather than unconditional surrender. Allied intelligence had not taken the prospect of a final German push seriously enough, and so German forces initially achieved surprise and made progress. For the Americans, this turned out to be the toughest and most costly battle of World War II: some 19,000 U.S. servicemen were killed. But the Germans lacked the capacity to sustain a long campaign, and their effort to do so left the German army exhausted, outnumbered, and outgunned—so depleted that there was little left for the actual defense of Germany in the following months."

The book provides a good overview of the most momentous political development of the late twentieth century, allowing readers to compare the former Soviet states’ early experiences with privatization, macroeconomic stabilization, and foreign trade and investment, as well as their later reforms dealing with taxes, pensions, and the rule of law. Although their paths in the post-Soviet period varied considerably, in general, eastern European countries that moved quickly to slough off the legacies of communist control recovered faster economically and achieved better subsequent growth; then again, those that moved faster also tended to have more recent and stronger histories of freedom, civil society, and democracy. In several countries, the prospect of membership in the EU and NATO served as spurs to reform but could also cause political divisions—a dynamic still at work in places such as Ukraine.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

Economic Advice Through Story-Telling,"In this important contribution to the understanding of economic development, Pinto draws on his extensive experience as an economist at the World Bank to explain why the macroeconomics and theories about growth typically taught in universities must be modified to account for the practical realities found in most transitioning and developing economies. In particular, economists tend to make highly inaccurate assumptions about conditions in such countries, making it more likely that conventional policy prescriptions will turn out to be ineffective or to have even perverse effects. To make his case, Pinto draws on stories from two transitioning economies, Poland and Russia, and two developing economies, India and Kenya. But he incorporates data and experiences from many other places, offering insights on economic growth and on the influence of both internal and external debt on economic performance during the past two decades.

New ideas are emerging in five main areas: shale gas, solar photovoltaics, electricity storage, electric cars, and LED lighting.

Among other fascinating topics, the book details new thinking about how to reduce the amount of water required by the process of hydraulic fracturing, which would make shale oil and gas more accessible in drier regions; recent efforts to greatly increase the storage capacity of lithium batteries so that they might someday power cars; new methods to make rechargeable batteries out of cheaper zinc; and cutting-edge ideas about how to improve LED lighting, which is more efficient than compact fluorescent bulbs and which, when combined with other technologies, would permit remote villages in Africa, India, and elsewhere to enjoy electric lighting without major new investments in infrastructure.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

The researchers examined inequality in income, wealth, debt, and education and delved into the social, political, and cultural impacts of inequality and the effects of policies meant to mitigate it. They used a common template and standardized metrics for all the countries, allowing them to make comparisons over time and across countries. They found that, with few exceptions, inequality rose over this time, especially in former communist countries. Public tolerance of inequality varies from country to country, the report shows, as do policies to address it. But there is a general preference in most countries for providing public services to all citizens, especially in education and health, instead of merely redistributing wealth from the rich to the poor.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."
60,Stress Test: Reflections on Financial Crises,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2015-02-16/stress-test-reflections-financial-crises,Stress Test: Reflections on Financial Crises,"The financial crisis of 2008 was the worst the United States had faced since 1930. At the time, Geithner was the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York; the following year, he become treasury secretary. Along with Ben Bernanke, then chair of the U.S. Federal Reserve, and Henry Paulson, then treasury secretary, Geithner took the lead in preventing the crisis from creating another Great Depression—which it very well could have done. He recounts those harrowing days in clear and gripping prose and persuasively justifies the often unpopular actions the federal government took, arguing that they were the least bad options available in a potentially catastrophic situation. He shreds the common charge that during the crisis, he was biased in favor of the big banks and valued Wall Street over Main Street. In dealing with the fallout from the 2008 crisis, Geithner focused on saving the banking system first because, he explains, the collapse of Wall Street would have devastated Main Street. (It’s worth noting that, unlike many other senior regulatory officials, Geithner had never worked in banking, and his long career as a technocrat had included a useful stint at the Treasury Department during the 1990s, when financial crises roiled Mexico, South Korea, and Thailand.) Geithner captures well the frustration that harried officials feel when dealing with grandstanding members of Congress and technically ignorant journalists, but he also concedes that during the crisis, his communication skills were not always impressive—a flaw that is thankfully not apparent in this important insider’s account of a disaster averted.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."
61,Explanation and Progress in Security Studies: Bridging Theoretical Divides in International Relations,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2015-02-16/explanation-and-progress-security-studies-bridging-theoretical,Explanation and Progress in Security Studies: Bridging Theoretical Divides in International Relations,"Unlike the natural sciences, in which observation and experimentation provide definitive evidence and lead directly to progress, the study of politics and world affairs rarely involves the resolution of debates—or even the accumulation of knowledge. This book represents an all-too-infrequent effort by a scholar of international relations to reflect on what political scientists do as a social scientific enterprise. Chernoff examines three core debates in the field of security studies: What are the causes of nuclear proliferation? What are the sources of alliance formation? And why do democracies tend to remain at peace with one another? Chernoff discovers that even in the relatively small and tightly integrated field of security studies, scholars have widely different views about what constitutes evidence and how to draw conclusions. Of course, drawing inferences about cause and effect in social and political interactions is notoriously difficult. But Chernoff is right to point out that the field of security studies must raise the bar when it comes to standards of evidence and measures of theoretical soundness.

But in later decades, political theorists began to focus more on economic growth, technology, and ideology. In this intriguing book, Zeihan makes the case that geography still matters. His main claim is that geography has shaped the power of states by facilitating or impeding their economic growth, and he argues that no country has benefited more from its geographic features than the United States. Blessed with the world’s most extensive natural network of waterways, more arable land than any other country, and the unparalleled protection afforded by two vast oceans, the United States could not help but become a global power. China, on the other hand, has been less lucky, with its scattered waterways, limited agricultural land, and insecure frontiers. Zeihan argues that these geographic features make China vulnerable to political fragmentation and overly dependent on a strong central state. When North America’s shale oil revolution and favorable demographic trends are added to Zeihan’s balance sheet, geography seems likely to continue to give the United States an edge for the foreseeable future.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."
63,The Assault on International Law,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2015-02-16/assault-international-law,The Assault on International Law,"Ohlin sharply critiques the “new realist” school of legal thinking, which questions the basic normative and legal foundations of modern international law and urges the United States to be skeptical of international legal obligations. He focuses on the writings of a small group of prominent scholars, including Jack Goldsmith, Eric Posner, and John Yoo. Ohlin argues that such thinkers have provided intellectual support for the recent intensification of U.S. opposition to international treaties and legal commitments, including the International Criminal Court and conventions against torture. Ohlin criticizes what he sees as the new realists’ overly narrow view of rationality and self-interest—a view in which complying with international law often conflicts with domestic constitutional authority and compromises a country’s ability to determine its own vital interests. Ohlin wants legal scholars and policymakers to adopt a more expansive notion of rational self-interest. Truly rational states, he argues, would seek to build stronger international laws and institutions, giving up some autonomy—and some exceptionalism, in the case of the United States—in exchange for a more stable and legitimate world order.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

The problem is rarely a lack of information; there is usually too much, and the challenge is to know how to filter it. Drawing on psychological and organizational theory, this masterful study shows that policymakers and intelligence analysts tend to emphasize different kinds of information in making their assessments. Political leaders are drawn to “vivid” indicators, such as face-to-face encounters and personal impressions, whereas intelligence experts rely on more concrete forms of data that can be tracked and monitored over time, such as military inventories. Yarhi-Milo explores these patterns in three rigorous case studies: British assessments of Nazi Germany’s intentions during the interwar period, U.S. perceptions of the Soviet Union during the Carter administration, and U.S. judgments about Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and the Soviet Union during the last years of the Cold War. Without putting forward a definite answer, the book enriches the debate over the best way for policymakers and analysts to filter the vast pools of information they gather about rivals.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."
65,The Transformation of the World: A Global History of the Nineteenth Century,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2015-02-16/transformation-world-global-history-nineteenth-century,The Transformation of the World: A Global History of the Nineteenth Century,"In this sweeping panorama, Osterhammel captures the dramatic shifts in how people lived and understood life during the nineteenth century. The world was exploding with new ways to communicate, record the past, and conceive of reality: libraries, museums, exhibitions, encyclopedias, novels, opera, newspapers, photography, time zones. People could now see themselves as the occupants of a particular location on earth and also as members of societies with understandable pasts and predictable futures. Rather than present a unified grand narrative, Osterhammel offers a rich “global history” of the century, one that features the West prominently but avoids Eurocentrism with vivid portraits of non-Western peoples and societies. The nineteenth century was a time of global empire building and transcontinental wars, of course, and so war and statecraft loom large in this story—but so, too, does everyday life. Behind all the details lurks a critical question: What was the main force that propelled the nineteenth century forward? Was it capitalism, nationalism, revolution, internationalism, modernity, or some other source of change? Osterhammel resists giving a simple answer, emphasizing instead the almost infinite complexity of the material and ideological forces that were at work.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

The easiest solution—simply labeling all of the country’s 185 nationalities as “Russian”—falls short. Kefeli digs deep into the history of the Tatar people of the Middle Volga region, the descendants of the Golden Horde that Ivan the Terrible defeated in the mid-sixteenth century. During the two centuries that followed, many Muslim Russians converted from Islam to Russian Orthodoxy. But in the nineteenth century, some of their descendants braved obstacles to return to the Islamic faith of their forebears. This complex tale of assimilation and conversion involves a staggering array of peoples—the Mari, the Chuvash, the Bashkirs, the Votiaks, the Kalmyks—some Muslim, others Orthodox, and still others animist. The modern incarnation of this intricate mosaic survives in Tatarstan, a key region of modern Russia."
67,The Left Side of History: World War II and the Unfulfilled Promise of Communism in Eastern Europe,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2015-02-16/left-side-history-world-war-ii-and-unfulfilled-promise-communism,The Left Side of History: World War II and the Unfulfilled Promise of Communism in Eastern Europe,"Frank Thompson was the older brother of the famous British historian E. P. Thompson. The elder Thompson, like many other bright, idealistic Oxbridge-educated youths in the 1930s, was repelled by fascism and drawn to communism. He fought and died as part of a British military mission to aid partisan forces fighting against the German-allied Bulgarian government. Ghodsee turns Thompson’s life and the equally heroic story of three Bulgarian brothers and their 14-year-old sister, who were also part of the resistance, into a gentle, reflective exploration of the idealism that drove them, despite the barbarity that many communists had already glimpsed in Stalin’s Soviet Union. The young girl, Elena Lagadinova, became a national hero and eventually a senior figure in the Bulgarian Communist Party. At 80, she also became Ghodsee’s friend and a source for the historian’s big questions: What ideals continued to drive Lagadinova and others like her under the communist system? How do they square the good they still see in that system with what they now recognize as its excesses? And how do they measure the good and bad of the past against the defects of the present?"

But “democracy assistance”—that is, organized efforts to foster political parties, electoral processes, and free media in other countries—is relatively new. One much-touted instance of successful democracy assistance was the revolution that drove Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic from power in 2000. Not so fast, says Spoerri. Having spoken with 150 people who were involved—Serbians and outsiders alike—and having read the internal reports of the primary aid-giving institutions, Spoerri concludes that although outsiders played a role in the events, it was not as large as they have claimed, and at times they actually hurt their own cause. In considering democracy assistance in Serbia both before and after Milosevic’s ouster, Spoerri argues that it succeeded only when it worked hand in glove with the other elements of the aid-giving countries’ foreign policies; when it did not, or when its true goal was to pick winners rather than to genuinely promote democracy, it was often counterproductive.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

She tells the familiar story of what happened at the Tehran conference in 1943 and at the Yalta conference in 1945, as the two men argued over Allied strategy in World War II and tensions mounted over planning for the postwar period. Butler uses details—the furnishings in a room, the leaders’ asides to their aides, their body language, and their quirks and passions—to offer a sense of what it was like to be in Roosevelt and Stalin’s presence and witness their exchanges. She also explores Roosevelt’s deep but often manipulative relationship with the third main character in the story, Winston Churchill. And she puts special emphasis on Roosevelt’s near-obsessive commitment to the establishment of the UN and his determination to preserve cooperation with the Soviet Union after the war. Other historians might quarrel with the degree to which Butler focuses on those matters, but few will deny the pleasure her book provides."
70,Ukraine Crisis: What It Means for the West,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2015-02-16/ukraine-crisis-what-it-means-west,Ukraine Crisis: What It Means for the West,"After the headlines come the details, which often contradict first impressions. Wilson, one of the most astute students of Ukrainian politics, briskly reviews the drama that has unfolded in Ukraine during the past year, as the Maidan demonstrations swelled, the Yanukovych regime shuddered and then cracked, and the Russians made moves into Crimea and eastern Ukraine. Although it might be some time before anyone knows precisely who did what during the bloody maelstrom of February 2014, Wilson’s account bears authority partly because he was on the scene. He folds each part of the story into a thoughtful history of what brought events to that point and concludes with a survey of other places in eastern Europe that might be vulnerable to Russian coercion and force, from the Baltic states to Armenia. The cast of characters is extensive and sharply drawn, beginning with a starkly dour portrait of Russian President Vladimir Putin, his regime, and the forces driving its foreign policy."

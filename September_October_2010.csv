The volume's best general essays contribute both to democratic theory and to public policy, and its 15 country case studies are informative introductions to recent (and woefully underreported) political developments in the region. Almost all African countries moved to multiparty electoral politics in the early 1990s, but only a handful can be unambiguously characterized as democracies today. As a result, the view of the continent that emerges from these surveys is mixed, with encouraging democratic progress in some countries balanced out by failure and stagnation in others. Although constitutionalism and democratic institutions have undeniably strengthened over the course of two decades of competitive electoral politics, much political power remains personalized and unaccountable. Africans generally appear to be supportive of democratic forms of government, yet the region's enduringly mediocre economic performance and the failures of its state institutions threaten that support."
1,The International Relations of Sub-Saharan Africa,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2010-09-01/international-relations-sub-saharan-africa,The International Relations of Sub-Saharan Africa,"Given Africa's poor economic performance, it is easy to dismiss the region as marginal. In this up-to-date and always readable introduction to Africa's international relations, Taylor argues that, on the contrary, Africa has often played a significant role on the global stage, and he provides many examples of how African leaders are able to manipulate the international system to pursue their own interests. They play the great powers off against one another, they leverage access to the region's substantial natural resources, and they take advantage of the region's economic failures to get foreign aid. Surveying the relationship between each of the world's major powers and Africa and discussing the region's international economic relations, the book also includes an especially incisive chapter on China's recent forays into the region and another one on recent British policies there. Although it is presumably targeted at an undergraduate audience, it will appeal to most interested readers."
2,Identity Economics: Social Networks and the Informal Economy in Nigeria,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2010-09-01/identity-economics-social-networks-and-informal-economy-nigeria,Identity Economics: Social Networks and the Informal Economy in Nigeria,"Within development circles, conventional wisdom has it that successful manufacturing sectors often develop in low-income countries thanks to identity-based social networks made up of producers working together. These networks are said to generate the social capital that can be used to overcome many of the shortcomings of underdevelopment. Meagher's careful study of two such networks in southwestern Nigeria -- of small, undercapitalized garment and shoe manufacturers -- suggests that the advantages for producers within the networks are being undermined by an increasingly dysfunctional state. Meagher shows that these networks, whose roots go back to the colonial era, bring in hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue and export their goods to states throughout West Africa. But in recent years, they have proved vulnerable to Asian imports and have largely failed to develop economies of scale, invest in new machinery, or generate new lines of production; these networks, it turns out, stifle innovation and consolidation, even as they protect their members. Informed by theory as well as sustained fieldwork, Meagher's study is a useful antidote to the purveyors of magic-bullet solutions for African development. It should be read by anyone interested in Africa's industrialization."
3,"Christianity, Politics, and Public Life in Kenya",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2010-09-01/christianity-politics-and-public-life-kenya,"Christianity, Politics, and Public Life in Kenya","A longtime observer of Christianity in Africa, Gifford has written a keen survey of the ideas and actions of Christian organizations and their leaders in Kenya. After analyzing the Catholic Church and mainstream Protestant churches, he examines the newer, lesser-known faiths making inroads in Africa, from the various Pentecostal churches to the syncretic churches that combine Christian and traditional African spiritual views. One of the book's main findings concerns the extent to which religion is linked to politics in Kenya. The mainstream churches' major role in promoting democratization in the early 1990s, it turns out, has been the exception. For the most part, the churches have been complacent about the country's social and economic ills, their laudable focus on the provision of social services notwithstanding. Gifford writes convincingly about the nature of Kenyan theology and various doctrinal issues, but the more notable contribution of this first-rate study derives from his focus on churches as social and political actors."
4,The Strange Alchemy of Life and Law,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2010-09-01/strange-alchemy-life-and-law,The Strange Alchemy of Life and Law,"Justice Sachs retired last year from South Africa's Constitutional Court, following a 15-year term during which the court helped define the judicial contours of the post-apartheid state. A lawyer for the clandestine African National Congress who barely survived an assassination attempt in 1988, he would go on to help draft the current constitution. This memoir mixes personal reminiscences with commentary on contemporary South Africa, and also includes brief but eloquent disquisitions on his legal philosophy and excerpts from his most famous decisions. His arguments about the nature of judging and the role of dignity in the law will attract the attention of legal experts. Meanwhile, anyone with an interest in South Africa will appreciate Sachs' justification for explicitly including socioeconomic rights in the South African constitution and his analysis of the logic behind the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. Some readers will disagree with his interpretations, arguing, for example, that the commission's work was undermined by contradictory objectives and inconsistent application and largely failed in its mission of reconciliation. Nonetheless, Sachs emerges from his narrative as an empathetic and humanistic judge deeply committed to a democratic South Africa. And besides, it is hard not to like a man who admits to doing his best thinking in the bathtub."
5,Underground Front: The Chinese Communist Party in Hong Kong,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2010-08-25/underground-front-chinese-communist-party-hong-kong,Underground Front: The Chinese Communist Party in Hong Kong,"Contrary to the expectations of many, Hong Kong has retained much of its liberal identity since the handover to China from the United Kingdom in 1997. The rule of law still applies, the media are still relatively free, and enough pro-democratic politicians are elected to the legislature to block proposed constitutional changes. Nevertheless, the influence of the Chinese Communist Party has been growing since 1997. Yet despite its being in effect the ruling party, it continues to remain underground. Loh, a former legislator and the leader of a Hong Kong think tank, breaks new ground in charting the history of the party in Hong Kong. Beijing's relations with the local party branch, she finds, have not always been harmonious, most recently when it failed to anticipate the huge demonstrations in 2003, which blocked state security legislation. But the party has been successful in co-opting the business elite and in winning elections. At issue now is how it will apply ""united front"" tactics to gain support for its version of elections for Hong Kong's leader and legislature.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."
6,Vietnam: Rising Dragon,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2010-08-25/vietnam-rising-dragon,Vietnam: Rising Dragon,"Hayton, a journalist for the BBC, was expelled from Vietnam in 2007 for his reporting on dissidents. While there, he seems to have figured out how all the gears mesh in this Southeast Asian paradox, where economic dynamism exists alongside political control, corruption alongside discipline, and a youth culture alongside a nanny state. Hayton reports how a network of elite families flourishes symbiotically within a secretive Communist Party apparatus, how a society intoxicated by consumerism is gingerly managed by a panoptic security bureaucracy, and how media workers and censors test one another's limits. According to Hayton, foreign foundations that think they are supporting governance reforms are instead solidifying the ""law-based state,"" a euphemism for one-party rule. Although he doubts the regime can keep control of an increasingly complex society, he does not claim to know when or how change will happen.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

This book is set up as a debate between the two authors over whether nuclearization has created a barrier to escalation during crises between the two nations -- the so-called nuclear stability theory, drawn from the U.S.-Soviet Cold War experience -- or whether it has instead created a shield for Pakistani adventurism and a risk of Indian overreaction. Analyzing past and present behavior by the two states, they try to apply the lessons of history to the future. Ganguly and Kapur agree that the two sides have managed their conflicts since 1998 without escalation but disagree on the extent to which this was due to nuclear deterrence. They also agree that the presence of nuclear weapons would make a failure to manage a crisis more catastrophic but disagree about whether nuclear arms increase or reduce the likelihood of such a failure. As for policy recommendations, the authors think India should refrain from developing ballistic missile defenses and that Pakistan should rein in its militant groups.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."
8,The Korean War: A History,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2010-08-25/korean-war-history,The Korean War: A History,"Cumings takes a broad view of his subject, covering not just the Korean War itself but also its origins in civil strife before and during the U.S. occupation, the political and cultural drivers of U.S. policy, the politics of forgetting in the subsequent half century, the painful recovery of repressed truths in recent years, and the war's legacies in both Koreas and in the United States. He sees the war as a continuation of the long struggle by Korean nationalists against Japanese domination and Korean collaborationism, both of which were resurgent under the United States' post-World War II occupation. He exposes the racist attitudes the occupiers brought to Korea and the military atrocities they carried out. Today, he believes, North Korea continues to wage the anticolonial struggle that the rest of the world, blinded by old stereotypes of savage ""Asiatics,"" has never understood. The failure to understand history contributes to the inability of Washington and Pyongyang to understand each other. Cumings covers these difficult topics in a sure-footed style, providing insights that are always stimulating, if not always convincing. More than a reworking of existing literature (including his own previous monographs), the book is full of new discoveries from archival research.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."
9,Taming Ethnic Hatred: Ethnic Cooperation and Transnational Networks in Eastern Europe,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2010-09-01/taming-ethnic-hatred-ethnic-cooperation-and-transnational,Taming Ethnic Hatred: Ethnic Cooperation and Transnational Networks in Eastern Europe,"Instead of ethnic violence, which is the focus of much of the academic literature on eastern Europe, McMahon shifts attention to what she claims has been far more prevalent: cases of ethnic cooperation. Given the bloody outcome in Yugoslavia, many easily assumed that much of eastern Europe, with its mottled map of ethnicities, would quickly degenerate into bloodshed, too. That it did not even in countries that seemed prime candidates, such as Latvia and Romania, her primary cases, owes, she argues, to a new phenomenon in international politics: the existence of international organizations and nongovernmental organizations, which have deflated the potential for violence. She does not claim that this spider web of ""transnational networks"" deserves all the credit or that its influence came only from the benchmarks it set and the dialogues it imposed. The argument is more thoughtful, incorporating the complex bottom-up dynamic by which a loose conglomeration of outside institutions fostered domestic forces that defused tensions."
10,Edwin O. Reischauer and the American Discovery of Japan,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2010-08-25/edwin-o-reischauer-and-american-discovery-japan,Edwin O. Reischauer and the American Discovery of Japan,"Edwin Reischauer was a pioneering American scholar of Japan at Harvard from 1938 to 1981, with time off to serve as U.S. ambassador to Tokyo under Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson. As ambassador, he took the first steps toward putting the U.S.-Japanese relationship on a more equal footing after the occupation. This gracefully written, compassionate biography by Reischauer's former student and cultural attaché throws light on some of the perennial issues of scholarship and diplomacy -- how to balance objectivity with engagement, how to interpret one culture for members of another, how to combine loyalty in public service with dissent, and how to reconcile professional ambition with family obligations. Packard discusses State Department infighting over China, Japan, and Vietnam; exposes the small-mindedness of academic controversies; and dismembers the once flourishing literature on ""the Japan threat.""Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."
11,Skeletons in the Closet: Transitional Justice in Post-Communist Europe,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2010-09-01/skeletons-closet-transitional-justice-post-communist-europe,Skeletons in the Closet: Transitional Justice in Post-Communist Europe,"Among the various puzzles raised by the way the once socialist countries of eastern Europe transitioned to another model, one of the more interesting concerns retribution against those from the upper ranks of the ancien régime. Why did the retribution not come quickly and harshly? And why, when it eventually came, was it in most cases comparatively gentle? Mobilizing a good portion of political science's methods and theoretical forms, Nalepa offers a simple but far from obvious explanation. Outcomes were the result not of popular pressures but of careful calculations on the part of old, successor, and oppositional elites. Oppositional elites trod warily because of ""skeletons in the closet,"" that is, for fear of exposing who among them had collaborated with the old regime -- the Polish president Lech Walesa, who allegedly was a police informant from 1970 to 1976, being a prime example. Successor elites, when back in power but facing its loss, crafted limited lustration laws to preempt something more severe in the future."
12,Myth of the Social Volcano: Perceptions of Inequality and Distributive Injustice in Contemporary China; Accepting Authoritarianism: State-Society Relations in China's Reform Era,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2010-08-25/myth-social-volcano-perceptions-inequality-and-distributive,Myth of the Social Volcano: Perceptions of Inequality and Distributive Injustice in Contemporary China; Accepting Authoritarianism: State-Society Relations in China’s Reform Era,"The Chinese have become more passionate believers in the American dream than Americans themselves, to judge by the findings of a nationwide survey conducted by Whyte in 2004. Although China is one of the most unequal countries in the world, most Chinese believe that wealth goes to those who work hard and that everyone has a fair chance to get ahead. The consensus holds across most sectors of society and is strongest among the group that is objectively most disadvantaged: rural residents. Whyte conjectures that this is because all groups, and the peasants in particular, are so much better off now than under Mao. Widespread rejection of the past and faith in the future, he believes, help power China's economic dynamism and generate support for the political system."
13,"Rock and Roll in the Rocket City: The West, Identity, and Ideology in Soviet Dniepropetrovsk, 1960-1985",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2010-09-01/rock-and-roll-rocket-city-west-identity-and-ideology-soviet,"Rock and Roll in the Rocket City: The West, Identity, and Ideology in Soviet Dniepropetrovsk, 1960-1985","It may come as a surprise, but in Leonid Brezhnev's day, the youth of Dniepropetrovsk, Ukraine, a closed missile-manufacturing city far from the cosmopolitan circles of Moscow and St. Petersburg, knew all about Deep Purple's lead vocalist, Ian Gillan, and, for that matter, the stars of nearly every other American and British rock band. Try as they might -- and try they did -- the thought police made little progress in channeling teenage interest away from such, as one ex-KGB official put it, ""ideological anti-Soviet pollution."" Zhuk, who grew up in Ukraine as part of the Beatles generation, details his cohort's intricate knowledge of the Western rock scene, smuggled Western movies, and, among schoolchildren, Western adventure classics. Officialdom had a reason to care. Even if the mania over Western youth culture was not a revolt against political realities, it did represent an effort to avoid them by creating a sphere of meaning free of outside authority. Zhuk's deft exploration of this cultural scene has the texture of real life in the last decades of Soviet communism, and because members of the generation he writes of are now leaders of a new Ukraine and a new Russia, it has a distinct contemporary relevance."
14,Russian Orientalism: Asia in the Russian Mind From Peter the Great to the Emigration,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2010-09-01/russian-orientalism-asia-russian-mind-peter-great-emigration,Russian Orientalism: Asia in the Russian Mind From Peter the Great to the Emigration,"The author's focus is not on the Russian mind writ large or even the mind of the ruling elite but rather on that of the generations of academic Orientalists from the eighteenth century on. Peter, Catherine, their nineteenth-century successors, and members of the court paid close attention to these scholars when it suited their foreign policy ambitions or cultural fads. And important Russian writers and composers, from Aleksandr Borodin to Leo Tolstoy, played with Asian themes. From Peter's time to the Bolshevik Revolution, for Russian intellectuals, ""the Orient"" signified the South -- Islam, the Turks, and the Persians. Russian interest in East Asia began with the Mongol conquerors in the thirteenth century, focused more in the eighteenth century on Catherine's taste for chinoiserie in her summer palaces, and then became more serious in the late nineteenth century as Russia embarked on its last stage of imperial expansion. Throughout, the dialogue had much more to do with the place and function of the Near East in Russia's sense of identity. The book's major contribution is an in-depth three-century study of the emergence and evolution of Orientalism within the Russian academy."
15,Let Our Fame Be Great: Journeys Among the Defiant People of the Caucasus,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2010-09-01/let-our-fame-be-great-journeys-among-defiant-people-caucasus,Let Our Fame Be Great: Journeys Among the Defiant People of the Caucasus,"Not many people have heard of the Circassians or know of their horrific end in 1864, when the imperial Russian military literally drove them into the sea from the upper Black Sea coast, including much of contemporary Abkhazia. Pockets of the survivors' descendants are spread across Jordan, Syria, even Israel, and in particular Turkey -- and some are in various corners of the North Caucasus. Bullough has visited many of these communities and vividly conveys what remains of their historical memory and cultural legacy, weaving their story into a detailed history of what actually happened. It is a story seriously misremembered on the Russian side of the Caucasus, in part because of romanticized nineteenth-century accounts by the likes of Aleksandr Pushkin and Mikhail Lermontov. Bullough also examines the fate of other peoples from the region -- the Karachays, the Balkars, and the Chechens -- covering Stalin's deadly depredations, the mass deportations to Central Asia during World War II, the violent colonization of the nineteenth century, and, completing the litany, Russia's recent wars in Chechnya. What makes the book particularly compelling, however, is not the macro statistics or the composite history but rather the poignant tales of the individuals Bullough met on his travels."
16,The Greengrocer and His TV: The Culture of Communism After the 1968 Prague Spring,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2010-09-01/greengrocer-and-his-tv-culture-communism-after-1968-prague-spring,The Greengrocer and His TV: The Culture of Communism After the 1968 Prague Spring,"Between 1968, when Moscow planted its boot athwart the Prague Spring, and 1989, when the Velvet Revolution overthrew the communist government in Czechoslovakia, the Czechoslovak regime went about cowing society in the name of ""normalization."" Accounts that focus on the civic group Charter 77, the spread of dissidence, and the petty revolts of a sullen population would lead one to believe that this did not work. But Bren argues that it was largely successful. In fact, the average Czech or Slovak -- Václav Havel's greengrocer -- settled into the regime's imposed ""quiet life."" They were joined by a good portion of the country's cultural elite, who could not bear to stop painting, singing, playing, and acting. Doing the history of passivity and accommodation is not easy, and Bren proceeds ingeniously by exploring the subtle buying into the system by the vast viewing audience that embraced the lives of the characters on popular television serials, lives redolent of what ""normalization"" meant. Then, in a particularly revealing step, she examines the awkward response to reruns of some of the most popular of these serials in the aftermath of what she calls Czechoslovakia's ""late communism."""
17,The Muslim Revolt: A Journey Through Political Islam,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2010-08-25/muslim-revolt-journey-through-political-islam,The Muslim Revolt: A Journey Through Political Islam,"A journey needs a vade mecum, and this little book fits the bill in size and substance for a journey through political Islam. It contains not maps, illustrations, and statistics but interpretations of the many visits and interviews across the Muslim world that Hardy clocked as a journalist over the past three decades. To these he adds summary histories of political Islam in many diverse countries. The Muslim Revolt is not confined to the Middle East. It covers Sudan, Pakistan, and Southeast Asia, which, it should be remembered, contains the world's largest Muslim country -- Indonesia. Hardy even treats the Muslim minority in Thailand and makes a passing reference to the Philippines. Especially compelling is his separate chapter on Muslims in Europe. Succinct and readable, this account demonstrates the regional and ideological diversity of political Islam even while explaining Muslims' malaise vis-à-vis the West."
18,Social Capital in Developing Democracies: Nicaragua and Argentina Compared,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2010-09-01/social-capital-developing-democracies-nicaragua-and-argentina,Social Capital in Developing Democracies: Nicaragua and Argentina Compared,"Despite being a poor, agrarian society, Anderson argues, Nicaragua is progressing toward democracy because Nicaraguans possess the right civic virtues: inclinations toward mutual cooperation with and trust in their fellow citizens. More controversially, Anderson claims that the Sandinista revolution -- arising from grass-roots organizations and advancing ideals of social justice -- greatly enhanced that social capital. She argues that Argentina, in contrast, despite its relative wealth, is less democratic than it ought to be because Argentines -- especially the political heirs to Juan Perón's semi-fascism -- are distrustful and hence not inclined to democratic participation and peaceful compromise. Still, Argentine checks and balances have restrained the authoritarian tendencies of Perón's followers -- a demonstration that states can construct ""institutional capital,"" such as strong parliaments and legal systems, that resist tyranny. Skeptical readers may find Anderson's empirical tests a bit thin, but Social Capital in Developing Democracies, always spirited and stimulating, is a valuable addition to the literature on the multiple pillars of democratic development."
19,Afghanistan: A Cultural and Political History,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2010-08-25/afghanistan-cultural-and-political-history,Afghanistan: A Cultural and Political History,"Those who have suspected that the ""graveyard of empires"" label does not quite capture Afghanistan in international politics past and present will find in this book the comprehensive coverage they seek. Barfield, an anthropologist and old Afghanistan hand, has written a history of Afghanistan that weaves in geography, economics, and culture (think tribes, rural-urban dichotomies, value systems) while maintaining a focus throughout on Afghan rulers' relations with their own people and the outside world. The many peoples, places, and dates cited make for a dense book. (Although there are useful maps, a timeline would have helped.) But it is lightened by many breaks in the narrative to address broad themes or make intriguing comparisons, such as likening patrimonial Afghanistan to medieval Europe. Barfield's Afghanistan is not frozen in amber. He describes a country whose state-building efforts were not unlike those of other Muslim polities in modern times but came later and produced less change. It is a country whose ruler must ""convince the Afghans that he is not beholden to foreigners, even as he convinces these very same foreigners to fund his state and military.""Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

Hirst presents a history of Lebanon's regional diplomacy since the late nineteenth century while concentrating on the period since the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. He is tough on all parties but consistently harsh on Israel."
21,Democratic Governance in Latin America,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2010-09-01/democratic-governance-latin-america,Democratic Governance in Latin America,"In this collection, some of Latin America's brightest policymakers join with leading social scientists to explain the region's success stories. But the contributors quarrel over whether there exist generally applicable guidelines for progress. The editors (with Jorge Vargas Cullell) mine large databases to dissect successful democratic governance across nine dimensions; not surprisingly, Chile, Costa Rica, and Uruguay score high, Guatemala and Haiti low. A contrary piece by Francisco Rodríguez pokes holes in statistical methods that seek to derive universal truths by manipulating large sets of data from many countries. The volume's most compelling essays are those written by veterans of public service. Now governor of Chile's central bank, José de Gregorio details the policies behind his nation's top-notch performance and is not shy about defending basic economic principles. Another exceptional Chilean practitioner-scholar, Alejandro Foxley, foresees a world of networked innovation nations -- Australia, Finland, Israel, Malaysia, South Korea, and, yes, Chile -- in which they all share best practices while each selects its own competitive industry cluster. In a particularly pithy contribution, the Brazilian statesman Fernando Henrique Cardoso reaffirms the role of decisive leadership in altering the paths of history."
22,Left Behind: Latin America and the False Promise of Populism,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2010-09-01/left-behind-latin-america-and-false-promise-populism,Left Behind: Latin America and the False Promise of Populism,"Twenty years ago, Edwards and Rudiger Dornbusch explained how populist largess and misconceived state intervention in Latin America led inevitably from initial euphoria to lasting regret. Updating his classic argument, Edwards rips into the Venezuelan caudillo Hugo Chávez and predicts his inevitable demise. But Edwards' real targets here are the run-of-the-mill policymakers who have failed to tackle the deeper institutional reforms -- ranging from building efficient judiciaries to demanding quality education -- required for growth. An exacting grader, the UCLA professor bestows an A only on his native Chile and suggests that a mere handful of other Latin American countries -- Colombia, Costa Rica, and Peru -- will likely dislodge vested interests (such as corrupt corporate monopolies and entrenched teachers' unions) and sufficiently advance reforms. At a time when Latin America's democratic strides and financial resilience suddenly compare favorably on a world scale, the author's anguish seems off key."
23,Declining Inequality in Latin America: A Decade of Progress?,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2010-09-01/declining-inequality-latin-america-decade-progress,Declining Inequality in Latin America: A Decade of Progress?,"Latin America is infamous for its yawning gaps between the very rich and the very poor. It is big news, therefore, that this deeply entrenched disgrace is showing signs of reversal. Over the last decade, according to the number-crunching economists assembled in this book, inequality measurably declined in 12 of 17 countries. The volume attributes this to two factors: the massive expansion of elementary schooling during the past decades, which narrowed the earnings gap between high-skilled and low-skilled workers, and carefully targeted government programs that transferred cash to the poor. (Democratization has helped, too.) The persistence of this redistributive momentum will depend, the editors contend, on progressive tax reforms. This is an important, evidence-rich study that directly challenges the notion that globalization inevitably widens income gaps in developing nations."
24,Learning to Salsa: New Steps in U.S.-Cuba Relations,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2010-09-01/learning-salsa-new-steps-us-cuba-relations,Learning to Salsa: New Steps in U.S.-Cuba Relations,"This volume describes the lessons for U.S. policy toward Cuba drawn from six simulations, wherein participants imagined that they were gathered in the West Wing or its Havana equivalent. Especially intriguing are the mock deliberations between Cuban President Raúl Castro and his closest advisers as they ponder how to free up the Cuban economy without loosening their grip on power. The contributors emphasize that notwithstanding the restrictive Helms-Burton Act of 1996, the White House retains considerable power to lift sanctions and permit a wide range of commercial, educational, and cultural exchanges. It could, to take one idea, license U.S. companies to exploit Cuban oil and gas reserves, thereby reducing Cuban dependence on Venezuela's Hugo Chávez. Like most committee reports, there are internal contradictions and unresolved dilemmas -- whether, for example, Washington should proceed unilaterally or link the pace of reform to reciprocal Cuban gestures. But Learning to Salsa is replete with doable ideas and should be required reading in the real West Wing."

All states engage in secret diplomacy, but Israel offers some of the most shocking examples. In this book (written by an editor at this magazine), the reader finds the Israel that emerged in the wake of the Holocaust linked decades later in off-the-books diplomacy to an apartheid South Africa led by Nazi sympathizers. That Israel had good relations with and sold weapons to South Africa during the two or so decades before the end of apartheid in the early 1990s was no secret, but the full dimensions of what amounted to an ""unspoken"" military alliance of nuclear proportions have only now come to light. Polakow-Suransky's dogged research efforts earned him access to South Africa's hitherto secret archives, and his equally dogged seeking out of all who would receive him has produced a compelling history. Although he deplores Israel's ties to the apartheid regime, Polakow-Suransky has treated the handful of officials in the two countries implementing that alliance fairly, even empathetically. He drops his guard only when he refers to ""the ever sanctimonious Shimon Peres."" How important were these secret ties? By 1979, South Africa had become Israel's largest arms customer, and the total military trade between the two countries reached an estimated $10 billion during the last two decades of the apartheid regime."
27,"Corporate Governance, Competition, and Political Parties: Explaining Corporate Governance Change in Europe",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2010-09-01/corporate-governance-competition-and-political-parties-explaining,"Corporate Governance, Competition, and Political Parties: Explaining Corporate Governance Change in Europe","The continental system of corporate governance, in which insider shareholders dominate company ownership, has traditionally differed from the Anglo-American model, in which a broad base of shareholders and institutional investors wield more power. But recently, Europe's system has moved substantially closer to that of the United Kingdom and the United States. Barker credits this shift not to right-wing ideology, since more often than not, it was left-wing parties that engineered the necessary legal changes. Instead, he argues, although right-wing parties were linked to the old system, left-wing parties used reform to attract new support from business. In addition to his econometric evidence, Barker offers an intriguing comparison of Germany and Italy to support his view -- although one wonders whether the rise of the service sector, the diversification of labor forces, and cross-class alliances might provide a more compelling explanation. Still, Barker's book contains interesting evidence that Europe's corporate landscape is anything but stagnant."
28,The Politics of Welfare State Reform in Continental Europe: Modernization in Hard Times,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2010-09-01/politics-welfare-state-reform-continental-europe-modernization,The Politics of Welfare State Reform in Continental Europe: Modernization in Hard Times,"Conventional wisdom, among both political commentators and scholars, views European welfare systems as overgenerous given Europe's demographic and fiscal pressures yet unreformable due to political pressure from voters. In fact, over the past decade, France, Germany, and other western European countries have substantially reformed their labor markets, unemployment benefits, family policies, welfare systems, and pension schemes -- the last of which is the subject of this book. Why would the French and the Germans not block any reduction in existing privileges, just as Americans stymie Social Security reform? Häusermann shows that welfare can be reformed by exploiting cross-cutting alliances among social groups in an increasingly complex labor market. Governments can carefully balance cutbacks with expansions in benefits, such as child-care assistance, for other constituencies. Successful reform coalitions mobilize outsiders against insiders, more skilled against less skilled workers, professionals against wageworkers, women against men, and service-sector workers against industrial workers. This book is not easy reading, but it is essential for those interested in the future of the welfare state, Europe's greatest modern political achievement."
29,NATO: In Search of a Vision,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2010-09-01/nato-search-vision,NATO: In Search of a Vision,"How many volumes have been devoted to the old chestnut: Wither NATO? As the transatlantic alliance enters its seventh decade, few authors can avoid drowning in the clichés of the genre. In a single concluding paragraph, this book states that NATO is in crisis, faces new challenges, and lacks a grand strategic vision, and that it must therefore develop a common threat assessment, craft a new consensus, establish a comprehensive approach to civil-military relations, work closely with other international institutions, and forge new global partnerships. Yet beneath the generalities, there are gems. No recent volume is a better guide to the historical legacies that created the current institutional structure of NATO, the policy dilemmas of the Balkans a decade ago and of Afghanistan today, the complex and ambiguous diplomatic relations between NATO and Russia, and the various schemes for enhancing cooperation within the organization."

Asia, they say, is the future. Hamilton and Quinlan's annual report, based on detailed surveys of economic activity, is crammed with data belying the conventional wisdom. It is not just that many U.S. regions and cities still depend primarily on European trade. More important, in the modern global economy, foreign investment is a deeper form of economic integration than trade, dwarfing the movement of goods and services. Up to three-quarters of U.S. foreign direct investment remains directed toward Europe. Research and development, closely connected to investment, moves primarily across the Atlantic as well. These patterns are particularly pronounced in the service sector, a harbinger of the new economy. The authors also find that the financial crisis has made Europe even more attractive, with U.S. firms actually divesting from China. An analysis of portfolio investments and money markets would have made the argument more persuasive. Still, no geopolitician or political economist can afford to ignore this case for the continued predominance of the $4.3 trillion transatlantic economy."

They are also those every country will soon face, if it does not already. This volume collects the insights of some of the most thoughtful academics, politicians, and policy analysts about Europe's long-term trajectory. Their views are idiosyncratic, as one might expect looking two decades into the future -- but all the more interesting as a result. Although the contributors rightly reject lurid scenarios of Islamization or the appeasement of terrorists as groundless, one might argue that this book (like most analyses of Europe these days) is more pessimistic than the facts warrant. It dwells on Europe's squandered potential in security and economic cooperation. Yet the EU has enlarged to 27 members, introduced the euro, established its own security forces, formed a single market, and dissolved borders in the Schengen area. What region of the world has achieved more in the past two decades?"

Gaztambide-Fernández went to Weston believing that attendance at such a school conferred a kind of permanent elite status on its students. As any of his subjects could have told him, this is wrong. These days, admission to an elite boarding school is simply one of the first steps in a long and uncertain process, and status anxiety -- mostly centered on the quest for admission to an elite college -- haunts both the students and their parents. Unfortunately, Gaztambide-Fernández's status obsession prevents him from examining more interesting questions. The reader learns nothing about what these students are taught, how they respond to it, or what ideas and values catch their imaginations. The author has wasted an immense opportunity, but perhaps in the end one should turn to novelists rather than anthropologists to explain the devious and complex processes that shape social life."
33,Progressivism: A Very Short Introduction,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2010-09-01/progressivism-very-short-introduction,Progressivism: A Very Short Introduction,"Nugent's book accomplishes three important things in very few pages. First, it provides an irreproachable and clear summary of the conventional view of the American Progressive movement and its historical importance. Second, it shows that a serious scholar can produce a short book that is well written and makes its points effectively and completely. The world needs more books like this one, and Oxford University Press should be commended for producing this series of ""very short introductions."" Finally, Progressivism shows the limits of the conventional approach to the Progressive movement. Nugent is too close to the Progressives to see them whole; like most treatments of the movement, his book is written in part to pass the torch on to new generations. Although there is much to honor in Progressive history, upper-middle-class white progressivism (in both its northern and southern wings) had a much more complex relationship with both populism and urban labor movements than Nugent seems willing or able to describe. The study of progressivism will have reached a satisfactory point when a book as brief, clear, and elegantly organized as Nugent's can present a more nuanced picture of this vitally important element of U.S. history."
34,Henry Clay: The Essential American,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2010-09-01/henry-clay-essential-american,Henry Clay: The Essential American,"Henry Clay is not only an also-ran in nineteenth-century presidential politics; today, he is an also-ran in American political memory. One of the triumvirate of statesmen (along with his colleagues and rivals John Calhoun and Daniel Webster) who competed with Andrew Jackson and one another to dominate the political stage between the War of 1812 and the Compromise of 1850, Clay (like Calhoun and Webster) never became president but seemed greater and more consequential than many of the relative nonentities who occupied the White House in those years. Clay was a polarizing figure; revered by some and loathed by others, he was the chief spirit of the Whig Party and a great advocate of what he called the American system of high tariffs, designed to build a world-class industrial economy in the United States. Historians have a hard time making him a compelling figure, and although the Heidlers have written a useful and clarifying account that is a pleasure to read, they have not created the kind of electrifying biography of Clay that could explain his appeal and importance to the twenty-first century. Until that book is written, this one will serve readers as a sound introduction to a major American figure."
35,National Security Strategy,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2010-08-25/national-security-strategy,National Security Strategy,"The Obama administration's first national security strategy paper is less a strategy paper than a statement of faith and a wish list. This was to be expected. The administration has its share of bright academics and think-tankers, people who often believe that the relationship between theory and policy is much closer than it is. They will, of course, learn better, like all those who have preceded them on the downward path from the sunny uplands of the academy to the meat grinder of history. Meanwhile, this document provides helpful insight into the mindset of the Obama administration in its early days. Although it contains what many will feel is an unseemly number of disparaging references to the last administration, in its transformational and Wilsonian ambitions (on issues such as nonproliferation), it is a document the Bush team can admire. Judging from the evidence here, the current administration shares the neoconservative belief that the world is ready to be fundamentally reshaped under U.S. leadership; the Obamans disagree violently with the Bushies on the nature of the reshaping and the tactics required to get there, but there is little sign here that the administration plans to draw in the United States' horns."

This legacy is complex and mixed; the liberal intellectual Walter Lippmann had more lives, ideologically speaking, than a cat. Progressives such as John Dewey and Charles Beard had the rare gift of being dogmatic, judgmental, and wrong on almost every major issue in American foreign policy during their lives. On the other hand, those such as George Kennan and Reinhold Niebuhr, who broke with core progressive ideals (Kennan did not much like democracy), often understood the world more clearly than either liberal internationalists or neoconservatives. Not all of this book is of equal value; editors have a ghastly habit of asking thinkers to make books of intellectual history ""relevant"" by ending with contemporary political analysis and, worse, prescription, and Beinart's concluding chapter is, intellectually, an anticlimax. The book is strongest when Beinart is examining the foundations of progressivism; the analyses of Lyndon Johnson and George W. Bush are less original and less masterly than the handling of U.S. foreign policy between 1913 and 1941. Nevertheless, with this book Beinart vindicates his standing as one of the major thinkers of his generation on the United States' world role."

Wirls provides a brisk and highly critical account of how this happened, starting with Ronald Reagan, noting the caution of George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton in the face of dire warnings about the dangers of assuming that the world had become a safer place, and then dwelling on the profligacy of George W. Bush. Wirls' target is what he sees as a built-in bias for spending on the military without any proper debate over whether the money is well spent. After a decade of frustrating military campaigns, and with the country facing such a staggering budget deficit, Wirls gives ammunition to those who believe that the Pentagon's budget is a prime target for cuts."

Editorial judgments reflect convictions about what is newsworthy, which often involves highlighting conflict and dissent. This can be frustrating for governments, but they have the advantage of being able to frame issues to suit their policies. Meanwhile, the public, which knows and cares little about international affairs, must work out who they trust and what they want to understand. In this landmark study, Baum and Groeling reveal how foreign policy messages are conveyed and undermined. With a cascading set of hypotheses and a demanding methodology, at times the argument just gets too complicated. Nonetheless, perseverance is rewarded. Using the Iraq war as their main case, the authors show how governments can take advantage of the ""elasticity of reality"" -- at least until it becomes too difficult to fit awkward events into their preferred narratives. This limits the durability of any ""rally round the flag"" effect. Indeed, War Stories demonstrates that bipartisanship may become an even more elusive goal, not only because of the evident divisions among the elite but also because of the fragmentation of the new media, which lets the public choose their opinion sources without too great a risk of being challenged."

Wuthnow considers how Americans have responded to seemingly existential perils, including nuclear weapons, terrorism, the millennium bug, the avian flu, and global warming. He traces how threats, first described by governments, the media, and experts, eventually seep into literature and movies, such as Nevil Shute's On the Beach or Al Gore's An Inconvenient Truth. This thoughtful account explains how official responses become institutionalized in organizations and professional bodies that have an interest in describing a threat in ways they can manage. Drawing on ""terror management theory"" from the field of psychology, Wuthnow finds that the public feels a need to do something, even something inconsequential and inappropriate, in response -- from charitable giving, vigils, and demonstrations to violence against members of those communities supposedly responsible, as after 9/11."

As a classicist with an interest in the contemporary, he sees continuities in why and how wars are fought. This is something that should be taken seriously, he believes, because it usually matters who wins and because the pain and suffering that wars inevitably cause is likely to be greater if generals and their political masters are clueless about its conduct. In the first, and best, essay in this lively collection, Hanson deplores the tendency of universities since the Vietnam War to treat war studies with the same distaste with which they treat war, as if oncologists should be viewed with suspicion given their fascination with cancer. Acknowledging his rather old-fashioned focus on strategy and battle, he is somewhat bemused by academic writing on war that is concerned with such matters as gender and identity. He makes his point by citing the responses of students taught in a night class at Fresno State, in California, whose down-to-earth responses to Thucydides (""I bet he killed a few to write like that"") he clearly prefers to the postmodern analyses of the Ivy League. As with any collection, the pieces are uneven, but the writing is always elegant and erudite."

Wildavsky argues that the latter objective will be extremely difficult to achieve, even over decades, but that the effort to increase access to higher-quality education, based on merit and performance rather than personal connections, will be beneficial all around. He addresses all aspects of the internationalization of universities -- students, faculty, branch campuses, financing, and even curricula -- and contends that the combination of research and teaching, although sometimes a source of tension within universities, has been a resounding success. Americans should not fear advances abroad, he points out, since these will only add to the stock of public knowledge and enlarge the possibilities for innovation, which makes everyone better off."

The alternative is not Soviet-style central planning, which is incapable of allocating resources in a modern economy, but state capitalism. Under this model, semiautonomous enterprises, often owned by governments, are guided in their strategic and sometimes even their operational decisions by their political masters. Although the usual goal for these enterprises is to create jobs, when profitable, they can finance the state. As this interesting book demonstrates, state capitalism is nothing new, but it has been given new longevity. Bremmer explains how the model has taken hold in China, Russia, Saudi Arabia, and other Arab Gulf states, which he contrasts with developing countries, such as Egypt and India, that have begun to rely more on markets. (Europe, surprisingly, is not covered.) The title aside, Bremmer believes that market capitalism has compelling advantages over state capitalism, especially its flexibility and capacity for innovation. Provided it is well managed, market capitalism will predominate in the long run, especially in functioning democracies, where state capitalism is hard to sustain against private enterprise. But state capitalism will not give way easily or quickly where it serves the interests of those in power."

Here he provides a fast-paced insider's account of his attempts to stay ahead of rapidly moving developments, especially during the second half of 2008. Whether these efforts succeeded or failed, they tended to be cliffhangers. The story is presented as a personal chronology of events, with occasional asides to provide the reader with background on persons, firms, agencies, and the legal limitations to action. The result is a fascinating picture of how Washington functions during a time of crisis, complicated in this case by an election campaign and a reluctance by many Republicans -- including Senator John McCain -- to cooperate with a pragmatic Republican administration."

The tenth parallel is the circle of latitude several hundred miles north of the equator, which happens to correspond to some of the ""hot spots"" in U.S. foreign policy -- Nigeria, Sudan, Somalia, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. Griswold uses this geographic device to argue that these countries are not only arid, poor, and war-torn but also the scene of the new ideological fault line between a resurgent Islam and evangelical Christianity. And she documents how what are often considered religious conflicts are also about land, water, oil, and other natural resources. Since ethnicity, religion, and economic livelihood sometimes coincide, however, conflicts over seemingly secular concerns are shaped by religious ideas, values, and doctrines, too."

Hours, even days, can be spent in disagreement over the exact wording of clauses. The still unfinished Doha Round of international trade negotiations, which began in late 2001 after a failed attempt in Seattle two years earlier, has been plagued by such disagreements since the beginning. Blustein, a journalist, captures both the broad thrust for trade liberalization and the numerous minidramas during Doha Round negotiations up through the failed ministerial meeting of July 2008. It is a sad tale of the triumph, so far, of particularistic interests and anxieties over a broad vision that almost all the parties have insisted they desire. Blustein concludes with a well-deserved swipe at the recent proliferation of bilateral preferential trade agreements, which have diverted attention from multilateral liberalization.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

In this new volume, the think tank has again assembled experts to assess the UN -- and the diagnosis has not improved much. Its activities, budgets, and personnel have continued to expand, but serious reform efforts have failed. The chapters catalog the body's dysfunctions and disappointments when it comes to military intervention, peacekeeping, the environment, human rights, and the advocacy of economic and social rights. Some of the contributors acknowledge the unique role that the UN plays as a multilateral organization with universal membership, particularly in areas such as human rights and public health. Kim Holmes makes a striking contribution in advancing the notion of ""smart multilateralism,"" arguing that U.S. policymakers should engage multilaterally only when it advances well-defined U.S. interests and promotes freedom. One theme that unites the volume is the need for the United States to work more closely with other democracies inside and outside the UN to isolate despotic states while giving greater voice to the American values of markets and freedom. Just how to reconcile this goal with the goal of strengthening global institutions to cope with the world's proliferating economic, social, and environmental problems, however, requires more reflection."

He journeys through the Western literary and philosophical canon in search of insights about power, order, and strategy. At each stop along the long arc of world history, Hill pauses to consider the thoughts of poets, playwrights, novelists, and essayists -- Homer, Thucydides, Virgil, Cervantes, Machiavelli, Shakespeare, Defoe, Rousseau, Schiller, Dickens, Nietzsche, and many more -- who illuminated the grand political developments of their day. (In Gulliver's Travels, to take one example, Jonathan Swift reflected on the various types of states at a time when the future of the modernizing state was uncertain.) Hill affirms the intellectual endeavor of looking at the world through a literary lens -- seeing literature as a ""tutor of statecraft"" -- as much as the strategic insights that specific texts might yield. At a deeper level, the book is about the fragility of order and the struggle of statesmen to balance, restrain, and legitimate state power."

Clinton-era foreign policy focused on economic hegemony and the expansion of NATO, and the George W. Bush administration recast the pursuit of unipolar dominance in terms of the ""war on terror,"" militarizing its diplomacy and transforming the United States from the ""world's favorite protector into its leading disturber of the peace."" Calleo singles out the neoconservatives for criticism, but he also thinks that the ""unipolar fantasy"" is a more general feature of the American political imagination. Due to the United States' declining economic and soft power, he concludes that the gap between grand visions of hegemonic dominance and national power will only grow. The book's most interesting arguments are about Europe and its role in redirecting Washington toward the pursuit of a more collaborative -- or even confederal -- interstate system in which a coalition of power centers takes the lead. Follies of Power provides one of the most elegant statements yet in favor of a U.S. strategy of retrenchment. But it fails to reflect on the liberal features of U.S. hegemony -- support for rules and an open world system -- which are still in demand."

This provocative little book looks at the numbers and concludes that retrenchment is unavoidable. Mandelbaum paints a gloomy portrait of the massive and unsustainable budget deficits that have been generated in the last decade by generous tax cuts, expanded federal programs, and the war in Iraq -- pressures that, as Americans age and entitlement spending expands, will only get worse. These accumulated liabilities will begin to impinge on the United States' foreign policy spending and geopolitical commitments. It will be a new situation for U.S. policymakers, who have not had to think in terms of economic costs since the 1940s. Mandelbaum calls the impending scarcity of foreign policy resources an ""unfortunate development,"" given the United States' long-standing role as a provider of global economic and security leadership. Not just American elites but the world, too, will need to adjust to the contraction of Washington's global role -- and Mandelbaum believes that this could lead to renewed great-power conflict as China, Russia, and other states compete to fill the vacuum. But he leaves as an open question what commitments and global roles the United States will need to cut."

This is especially true in the cases of China and India, which both boast near double-digit rates of growth and have therefore inspired confidence around the region. But too many commentators discuss China and India with breathless admiration -- extrapolating, for example, that growth will continue at a breakneck pace for decades. In doing so, they treat emerging economies as if they were already world powers, echoing the hubris that preceded the Asian currency crisis of 1997-98."

Norrlof disagrees. In this carefully argued treatise, she contends that despite a gradual decline in its relative economic size, the United States still possesses three critical features that give it ""positional advantages"" over all other states: the largest domestic economy, the key world currency, and the strongest military. Although some observers think that the United States' hegemonic burdens outweigh any benefits, she suggests otherwise: Washington actually reaps more than it pays out in the provision of public goods. Drawing on ""hegemonic stability theory,"" which was developed by Charles Kindleberger, Robert Gilpin, and others in the 1970s and 1980s, Norrlof argues that the United States has incentives to use its dominant position to organize and maintain an open economic system, providing security and access to markets for other states while enjoying a steady stream of economic benefits for itself. With the special role of the dollar, the United States has been able to externalize the costs of macroeconomic adjustment, and its global military presence reinforces the perceived stability of the dollar and the U.S. market. Thanks to the mutually reinforcing logics of trade, money, and security, Norrlof argues, even a gradual decline in the United States' global market share would not undermine its primacy."

Some fish populations are accumulating anthropogenic toxins; others threaten to disappear altogether (remember Atlantic cod?). Climate change may already be rearranging rainfall and glacial melting patterns, making life in arid areas increasingly untenable and intensifying floods in the already wet, and more populous, regions."
54,Not Ready for Prime Time,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/south-africa/2010-09-01/not-ready-prime-time,Not Ready for Prime Time,"Few matters generate as much consensus in international affairs today as the need to rebuild the world geopolitical order. Everyone seems to agree, at least in their rhetoric, that the makeup of the United Nations Security Council is obsolete and that the G-8 no longer includes all the world's most important economies. Belgium still has more voting power in the leading financial institutions than either China or India. New actors need to be brought in. But which ones? And what will be the likely results? If there is no doubt that a retooled international order would be far more representative of the distribution of power in the world today, it is not clear whether it would be better."
55,Bringing Israel's Bomb Out of the Basement,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/israel/2010-09-01/bringing-israels-bomb-out-basement,Bringing Israel’s Bomb Out of the Basement,"In the shadow of the Holocaust, Israel made a determined effort to acquire nuclear weapons. However, just as fear of genocide is the key to understanding Israel's nuclear resolve, that fear has also encouraged nuclear restraint. After all, if Israel's enemies also acquired the bomb, the Jewish state might well face destruction, given its small size and high population density. Moreover, the specter of killing large numbers of innocent people, even to save their own, was morally unsettling for Israeli leaders."
56,Beyond Moderates and Militants,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/turkey/2010-09-01/beyond-moderates-and-militants,Beyond Moderates and Militants,"In the Middle East, U.S. President Barack Obama has spent the first year and a half of his presidency seeking to undo the damage wrought by his predecessor. He has made up some ground. But given how slowly U.S. policy has shifted, his administration runs the risk of implementing ideas that might have worked if President George W. Bush had pursued them a decade ago. The region, meanwhile, will have moved on."

60,Defending a New Domain,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2010-09-01/defending-new-domain,Defending a New Domain,"In 2008, the U.S. Department of Defense suffered a significant compromise of its classified military computer networks. It began when an infected flash drive was inserted into a U.S. military laptop at a base in the Middle East. The flash drive's malicious computer code, placed there by a foreign intelligence agency, uploaded itself onto a network run by the U.S. Central Command. That code spread undetected on both classified and unclassified systems, establishing what amounted to a digital beachhead, from which data could be transferred to servers under foreign control. It was a network administrator's worst fear: a rogue program operating silently, poised to deliver operational plans into the hands of an unknown adversary."
61,Staying Power,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/afghanistan/2010-09-01/staying-power,Staying Power,"Nine years ago, the United States worked with Afghanistan's Northern Alliance to overthrow the Taliban government in Kabul. The world was united, the cause for war was clear, and U.S. President George W. Bush enjoyed the support of roughly 90 percent of Americans. That was a long time ago."

63,Russia's New Nobility,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/russia-fsu/2010-09-01/russias-new-nobility,Russia’s New Nobility,"In December 2000, Nikolai Patrushev, who had succeeded Vladimir Putin as director of Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB), gave an interview to mark the anniversary of the founding of the Cheka, the Bolshevik secret police. He described the FSB's personnel: ""Our best colleagues, the honor and pride of the FSB, don't do their work for the money,"" he said. ""They all look different, but there is one very special characteristic that unites all these people, and it is a very important quality: It is their sense of service. They are, if you like, our new 'nobility.'"""
64,Out of Order,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2010-09-01/out-order,Out of Order,"In June, U.S. President Barack Obama acted swiftly and wisely in relieving General Stanley McChrystal of command of the war in Afghanistan. In removing McChrystal for making disparaging comments about civilian leaders in a Rolling Stone article, the president reasserted the constitutional principle of civilian control of the military. He also immediately appointed General David Petraeus as the new commanding general in Afghanistan, with the U.S. mission continuing as before. Republicans did not try to exploit the situation for political advantage. There was no crisis, no rending of the fabric of political-military relations, and no threat to the U.S. Constitution."
65,How to Handle Hamas,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/israel/2010-09-02/how-handle-hamas,How to Handle Hamas,"The biggest obstacle to peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians is not the Palestinians' demand that Jewish settlements in the West Bank be dismantled, the barrier separating much of the West Bank from Israel, or the recent rightward shift of the Israeli body politic. It is the emergence of Hamas as the de facto government of the Gaza Strip, where 1.5 million Palestinians reside."
66,Smaller and Safer,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/russian-federation/2010-09-01/smaller-and-safer,Smaller and Safer,"On April 8, sitting beside each other in Prague Castle, U.S. President Barack Obama and Russian President Dmitry Medvedev signed the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START). Just two days earlier, the Obama administration had issued its Nuclear Posture Review, only the third such comprehensive assessment of the United States' nuclear strategy. And in May, as a gesture of openness at the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty Review Conference in New York, the U.S. government took the remarkable step of making public the size of its nuclear stockpile, which as of September 2009 totaled 5,113 warheads."
67,An Unlikely Trio,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/review-essay/2010-08-19/unlikely-trio,An Unlikely Trio,"Insanity, it is often said, is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results. When it comes to the Middle East, writes Stephen Kinzer, a veteran foreign correspondent, Washington has been doing just that. Hence, in Reset: Iran, Turkey, and America's Future, he proposes a radical new course for the United States in the region. The United States, he argues, needs to partner with Iran and Turkey to create a ""powerful triangle"" whose activities would promote a culture of democracy and combat extremism."

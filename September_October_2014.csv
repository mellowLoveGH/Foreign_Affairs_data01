That would be a mistake: limits on the collection of personal data should remain central to the protection of privacy. Simply put, governments and organizations cannot abuse or lose control of personal data that they cannot collect or retain in the first place."
1,Showdown in Santiago,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/south-america/2014-08-18/showdown-santiago,Showdown in Santiago,"More than 40 years after the 1973 military coup that cost Chilean President Salvador Allende his life and brought General Augusto Pinochet to power, the historical record on the U.S. role in Chile continues to stir debate. Far from being a “cold case” of the Cold War, as Foreign Affairs implied in its July/August issue, it remains a hot and controversial topic. Jack Devine’s audaciously titled article, “What Really Happened in Chile,” relates his version of the story of infamous U.S. covert actions in which Devine himself played a key role as a young CIA officer based in Santiago."

Neither side stood to gain from acknowledging that Washington’s favorite dictator owed his position to American skullduggery. So regarding the events of August 1953, when the shah fled his country after unsuccessfully challenging its constitutionally elected prime minister, only to be restored a few days later after a military coup, both sides stuck to the story that the shah’s loyal subjects were responsible for his salvation."

6,Passage to India,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/india/2014-08-11/passage-india,Passage to India,"In the century ahead, U.S. strategic interests will align more closely with India’s than they will with those of any other continental power in Asia. The United States and India both seek to spread democracy, expand trade and investment, counter terrorism, and, above all, keep the region peaceful by balancing China’s growing military power. As Washington expands its presence in Asia as part of the so-called pivot, New Delhi will be a critical partner. In the Asia-Pacific region, especially, India joins Australia, Japan, South Korea, and others in a U.S.-led coalition of democratic allies. And as the most powerful state in South Asia, India will exert a positive influence on a troubled Afghanistan, as well as on Bangladesh, Nepal, and Sri Lanka."
7,Leaders Indicating,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/americas/2014-08-11/leaders-indicating,Leaders Indicating,"The normal rhythm of politics tends to lead most nations’ economies around in a circle, ashes to ashes. This life cycle starts with a crisis, which forces leaders to reform, which triggers an economic revival, which lulls leaders into complacency, which plunges the economy back into crisis again. Although the pattern repeats itself indefinitely, a few nations will summon the strength to reform even in good times, and others will wallow in complacency for years -- a tendency that helps explains why, of the world’s nearly 200 economies, only 35 have reached developed status and stayed there. The rest are still emerging, and many have been emerging forever."
8,An Army to Defeat Assad,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/middle-east/2014-08-18/army-defeat-assad,An Army to Defeat Assad,"Syria is a hard one. The arguments against the United States’ taking a more active role in ending the vicious three-year-old conflict there are almost perfectly balanced by those in favor of intervening, especially in the aftermath of the painful experiences of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. The cons begin with the simple fact that the United States has no interests in Syria itself. Syria is not an oil producer, a major U.S. trade partner, or even a democracy."
9,Print Less but Transfer More,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2014-08-11/print-less-transfer-more,Print Less but Transfer More,"In the decades following World War II, Japan’s economy grew so quickly and for so long that experts came to describe it as nothing short of miraculous. During the country’s last big boom, between 1986 and 1991, its economy expanded by nearly $1 trillion. But then, in a story with clear parallels for today, Japan’s asset bubble burst, and its markets went into a deep dive. Government debt ballooned, and annual growth slowed to less than one percent. By 1998, the economy was shrinking."
10,A Broken Promise?,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/russia-fsu/2014-08-11/broken-promise,A Broken Promise?,"Twenty-five years ago this November, an East German Politburo member bungled the announcement of what were meant to be limited changes to travel regulations, thereby inspiring crowds to storm the border dividing East and West Berlin. The result was the iconic moment marking the point of no return in the end of the Cold War: the fall of the Berlin Wall. In the months that followed, the United States, the Soviet Union, and West Germany engaged in fateful negotiations over the withdrawal of Soviet troops and the reunification of Germany. Although these talks eventually resulted in German reunification on October 3, 1990, they also gave rise to a later, bitter dispute between Russia and the West. What, exactly, had been agreed about the future of NATO? Had the United States formally promised the Soviet Union that the alliance would not expand eastward as part of the deal?"
11,The New Arabs; Arab Social Media Report,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2014-08-18/new-arabs-arab-social-media-report,The New Arabs; Arab Social Media Report,"Since the Arab uprisings of 2011, Cole, an academic historian and prolific blogger, has tracked the young generation he calls “the Arab millennials,” or “the Arab Gen Y,” or simply “the Arab New Left.” In this book, he focuses on Egypt, Libya, and Tunisia and argues that the millennials brought down those countries’ authoritarian regimes and that, any appearances to the contrary, the millennials will remain a force in one form or another and will find ways to hold to account the new regimes in all three countries. Cole’s chronicle is interesting, but he doesn’t provide enough quantitative data about the millennials’ basic characteristics, making it difficult to understand their agenda, assess their staying power, or grasp the political variety that surely exists within the demographic. For example, the leaders of the 2011 uprising in Egypt, such as the young people who formed the April 6 Youth Movement, are quite different from the youthful leaders of Tamarod (Mutiny), the group that provoked the downfall of Egypt’s first freely elected civilian president, Mohamed Morsi, two years later."

Sander has produced something better than a battlefield memoir: an accomplished history of the operation that explains why it failed. The U.S. Army had long wanted to destroy a North Vietnamese transportation hub in the Laotian village of Tchepone but had refrained because such a move would have presented political problems for the Nixon administration and would have required a great deal of military effort. By the end of 1970, however, the administration decided that an attack on Tchepone was worth the potential costs. But the mission was a disaster: the North Vietnamese pushed back, and the South Vietnamese ended up withdrawing under heavy fire. As it had done many times before, Washington overestimated the capabilities of the South Vietnamese forces and underestimated the strength of the North Vietnamese."
13,Africa’s Urban Revolution,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2014-08-18/africas-urban-revolution,Africa’s Urban Revolution,"Sub-Saharan Africa boasts the fastest-growing urban population of any region in the world. With an annual rate of urbanization of 3.3 percent, the region can’t be viewed as primarily rural anymore. Indeed, the authors of this timely collection of essays estimate that if the region maintains its present rate of growth, a majority of Africans will live in cities by 2030. Already today, in absolute terms, there are more Africans living in cities than there are Americans or Europeans living in cities. The authors resist the common tendency to depict Africa’s cities as unfolding ecological and political disasters, instead recognizing that urban populations in sub-Saharan Africa have exhibited great resilience and ingenuity. But the authors do criticize the relative inattention paid to urban policy concerns by the region’s governments and lament the woefully inadequate public resources devoted to improving urban infrastructure and to addressing welfare needs. A lack of resources plays a major role, they concede, but they also argue that African governments have historically feared the potential political power of concentrated urban populations and so have been reluctant to devolve power to the municipal level."
14,Authoritarian Origins of Democratic Party Systems in Africa,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2014-08-18/authoritarian-origins-democratic-party-systems-africa,Authoritarian Origins of Democratic Party Systems in Africa,"Africa’s fledgling democracies feature both stable, strong political parties, in countries such as Ghana, and fractious, weak, and unstable parties, in countries such as Benin. In this finely crafted book, Riedl argues convincingly that the main factor in determining the strength of parties in any given country in the region is the extent to which the authoritarian regime that dominated politics prior to the country’s democratic transition was able to influence the terms of democratization. But the relationship is somewhat counter-intuitive: the greater the staying power of the old regime, the more likely it is that the opposition coalesced into a well-institutionalized, strong party. The book’s best sections smartly observe and carefully compare the electoral politics of Benin, Ghana, Senegal, and Zambia. Riedl demonstrates that in contemporary Africa, single-party authoritarian rule might well have left a positive legacy."

The Eritrean People’s Liberation Front (EPLF) took power and promised rapid development, suggesting that it would model its economic policy after Singapore’s, focusing on exports to the European market and tourism on the coral-rich coastline of the Red Sea. Many hoped that a vibrant and well-educated expatriate population would return to Eritrea and spearhead its development. Instead, the country has remained one of the poorest in the world, and its government pursues a counterproductive policy of autarky that owes considerably more to North Korea than Singapore. This insider’s account by a former member of the EPLF’s leadership blames President Isaias Afwerki, who turned the country into a personal fiefdom. Giorgis never completely explains why he chose to accept leadership positions in the Afwerki regime until finally breaking with it in 2006, but he provides interesting behind-the-scenes descriptions of key policy decisions and power struggles within the EPLF. Particularly good are two chapters devoted to the 1998–2000 border war with Ethiopia and the subsequent peace negotiations."
16,"Africa in the World: Capitalism, Empire, Nation-State",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2014-08-18/africa-world-capitalism-empire-nation-state,"Africa in the World: Capitalism, Empire, Nation-State","This wide-ranging essay on the evolving relationship between Africa and the rest of the world since the Middle Ages is erudite and insightful. Cooper uses his considerable knowledge of the historical record to comment on contemporary debates about the role of institutions in economic development and the extent to which Africa’s progress has been impeded by its international relations. He also asks whether the current political map of the continent, which features more than 50 countries, was inevitable, or whether multistate federal structures could have developed. He has no easy answers to these questions but offers good ways of thinking about them. The book’s most novel passages concern the failure to create a broad Francophone federation in West Africa in the waning years of French colonial rule. Cooper shows how such a federation was thwarted by French concerns about granting full citizenship rights to Africans and by the ways that the quest for sovereignty quickly put African nationalist leaders at odds with one another."
17,The Bright Continent: Breaking Rules and Making Change in Modern Africa,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2014-08-18/bright-continent-breaking-rules-and-making-change-modern-africa,The Bright Continent: Breaking Rules and Making Change in Modern Africa,"In her sunny tour of contemporary sub-Saharan Africa, Olopade does not deny the existence of the region’s ills so much as selectively focus on the positive contributions of individuals and grass-roots civic organizations. In her telling, kanju, a Yoruba term that broadly suggests resilience and ingenuity, will help Africans overcome poor governance and material scarcity. The book profiles creative entrepreneurs who have improved people’s lives or who have forced governments to act more positively; these stories include fascinating details and make the book an excellent introduction to contemporary sub-Saharan African society and the region’s economy. Olopade’s optimism is refreshing, especially because she does not oversell her arguments and never peddles fashionable magic bullets to solve the region’s problems. The more policy-oriented reader will nonetheless be disappointed that few prescriptions emerge from her analysis and will wonder whether kanju is more a palliative for the region’s shortcomings than a solution to them."
18,"An Anatomy of Chinese: Rhythm, Metaphor, Politics",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2014-08-18/anatomy-chinese-rhythm-metaphor-politics,"An Anatomy of Chinese: Rhythm, Metaphor, Politics","Link focuses on how Chinese syntax is to a great extent ordered by speech and sound and not by the kind of grammatical logic at work in many Western languages. He scrutinizes the ways in which certain Chinese words take on metaphoric meanings. For example, the word for “yellow” can imply “licentious,” and the word for “black” sometimes connotes “calamity”; the terms for “to eat” or “to ingest” can imply “taking or conquering,” “suffering,” or “incurring blame.” In writing about the intersection of politics and language in China, Link reveals -- with precision, courage, and irony -- how the Chinese Communist Party’s officialese dominates the speech and writing of the world’s most populous country. Link’s mastery of Chinese extends beyond modern Mandarin to include subdialects of Cantonese, and it is difficult to overstate the breadth and subtlety of his analysis. This book should be read by anyone who wants to engage with China intellectually, commercially, or culturally."
19,In Transit: The Formation of a Colonial East Asian Cultural Sphere,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2014-08-18/transit-formation-colonial-east-asian-cultural-sphere,In Transit: The Formation of a Colonial East Asian Cultural Sphere,"The short-lived Japanese empire (1895–1945) espoused a confused and contested ideology. One of its strands was assimilationist: Koreans, Taiwanese, and others were supposed to act as imperial subjects and, in some parts of the empire, were encouraged to accept Japanese names, language, culture, and even marriage partners. But the project was also racist, and many Japanese treated other Asians as inferior. The diverse ways in which both Japanese and colonial subjects navigated these contradictions have rarely been explored in English. Although Kleeman’s book is sometimes disjointed, it helps open up this interesting subject by examining the lives of a number of women who crossed boundaries for personal or professional reasons. Her subjects include Japanese aristocrats who married into Manchu or Korean royal families, fiction writers who romanticized colonial encounters, and actors and dancers who became exotic superstars. More people cooperated with the Japanese colonial project than most Asians today acknowledge or realize. But after World War II, many of these boundary crossers were rejected by their own societies, as anti-Japanese sentiments drove the reassertion of exclusively national identities."
20,A Middle Class Without Democracy: Economic Growth and the Prospects for Democratization in China,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2014-08-18/middle-class-without-democracy-economic-growth-and-prospects,A Middle Class Without Democracy: Economic Growth and the Prospects for Democratization in China,"About a quarter of the Chinese population is now middle class. Classic modernization theory predicts that these new middle-class citizens will push for democracy. But as earlier researchers have pointed out, few have done so. Chen attributes this restraint to three factors. The middle class depends on the state-dominated economy for its prosperity, it is relatively satisfied with the state’s provision of urban services, and it fears the disruptive potential of the lower classes, which still form a large majority. Middle-class Chinese want individual rights, but they are less likely than workers and farmers to support democratizing reforms that they fear might destabilize the government. Chen’s study relies chiefly on survey research, which makes it difficult to uncover the effects of the fear of repression, and of the government’s control of information, on people’s attitudes. Chen believes that middle-class support for the government could weaken if economic conditions worsen or if economic liberalization reduces the dependence of the middle class on the state."
21,North Korean Nuclear Operationality: Regional Security and Nonproliferation,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2014-08-18/north-korean-nuclear-operationality-regional-security-and,North Korean Nuclear Operationality: Regional Security and Nonproliferation,"Pyongyang is well on the way to mastering the technologies it needs to build a deliverable nuclear weapon. But the expert contributors to this volume argue convincingly that little will change when North Korea crosses that threshold. The retaliatory capabilities of Japan, South Korea, and the United States are already sufficient to deter Pyongyang from attacking anyone with a nuclear weapon, and North Korea already has enough military power to deter its neighbors from attacking it. China and Russia do not approve of further advances in North Korean nuclear weaponry, but they will continue to support Pyongyang in order to avert a collapse of the North Korean regime, which serves as a buffer against U.S. power. Several contributors believe that the key to changing this dead-end dynamic is for Washington to give Pyongyang diplomatic recognition and institutionalized security guarantees and for South Korea to deepen its engagement with the North, in exchange for a freeze on North Korean weapons development. But these proposals are unlikely to be adopted -- and even if they were, they would probably fail to alleviate the sense of siege that motivated Pyongyang to pursue nuclear weapons in the first place."

Kaplan traveled around the rim of the South China Sea in an attempt to understand competition among the littoral states. Those countries value this body of water for its transportation routes, undersea oil, and fishery resources. And modern military technology has made the South China Sea vital to the security of the entire Asia-Pacific region: as technology has shrunk distances, China’s interests have conflicted with the other states in the area. Kaplan may overdramatize when he says that Chinese domination of the South China Sea would make it a “virtual hegemon” in a region that stretches from the Indian Ocean to the Pacific, but he does not think this is the most likely outcome. Rather, he argues that balance-of-power politics might allow for a growing Chinese role without major conflict, albeit amid constant tension and friction. But this least worst scenario depends on a continued robust U.S. presence and on American technological superiority, both of which are perennially uncertain."
23,The Army and Democracy: Military Politics in Pakistan,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2014-08-18/army-and-democracy-military-politics-pakistan,The Army and Democracy: Military Politics in Pakistan,"Shah is a strong advocate for civilian control of military forces. His book explores why such control has consistently eluded Pakistan’s government. Many others have studied the Pakistani military, but Shah brings new insights based on interviews with intelligence officials and analyses of Pakistan’s National Defense University and its publications. He argues that Pakistan’s military maintains its own institutional norms and culture. It views civilian politicians as inherently incompetent and therefore as a threat to national security. The military blames its own serial bungling, from the loss of East Pakistan in 1971 to the fiasco of the Kargil conflict with India in 1999, on the failings of the civilian leadership. Since the military regime led by Pervez Musharraf ended in 2008, there have been glimmers of hope that civilian control of the military might be established. But Shah cautions that the military’s spy agency, Inter-Services Intelligence, remains a powerful tool and that the military retains tight control of Pakistani policy on Kashmir, India, and nuclear weapons. The military seems to have learned to prefer indirect control to direct rule, and Pakistan’s most powerful partner, the United States, is unlikely to pressure the military to change its ways."

My colleague should read Hamid’s book; so should others. Many observers have explored the question of whether Islamist moderation is tactical or sincere. Hamid’s answer is clear: it is tactical. Hamid has extensively researched the Brotherhood’s branches in Egypt, Jordan, and Tunisia. He explains that only a legitimate concern for survival led the Brotherhood to moderate its positions before 2011 and to deliberately underperform in elections held by authoritarian regimes in all three countries. The democratic openings after 2011 forced a change in strategy: now, in order to survive, the Brotherhood had to win elections. The strong showing of Salafists in Egypt’s first open parliamentary elections, in 2011–12, was a Tea Party moment for the Brotherhood, forcing the organization to tack to the right. Looking to the future, Hamid takes a clear stand: “Liberalism cannot hold within it Islamism.” Liberal secularists and Islamists, he writes, hold “irreconcilable worldviews.”"
25,Do Muslim Women Need Saving?,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2014-08-20/do-muslim-women-need-saving,Do Muslim Women Need Saving?,"""It is never easy to cleanly distinguish freedom and duty, consent and bondage, choice and compulsion.” So writes Abu-Lughod, an anthropologist with three decades of field experience in the Middle East, reflecting on the question of women’s rights and status in Muslim-majority societies. This elegantly written and compelling book contends that women in such places suffer more from the inequities of globalization than from patriarchy. Indeed, she suggests that humanitarianism represents the new face of colonialism, sometimes unwittingly -- arguing, for example, that well-intentioned Western feminism has served as a cover for the U.S.-led war against the Taliban in Afghanistan, a military action she deems to be deeply flawed. She criticizes a genre of writing about the Muslim world that she terms “pulp nonfiction”: sensationalized accounts of rape, oppression, and brutality that are suffused with a kind of titillating sexuality. She presents an interesting and original analysis of Muslim feminism and tells the complex life stories of a number of ordinary Egyptian women, revealing them to be far more than simple tales of oppression. Abu-Lughod’s message is valuable, but she asks readers to evince a sensitivity to nuance that has taken her 30 years to acquire."

The book begins in the late nineteenth century by exploring the politics surrounding the monumental project of building the railroad and the extraordinary challenges it posed. Wolmar describes in textured detail what travel on the Trans-Siberian Express has looked like from its early years up to the present. He notes the railway’s original mission as a military and imperial project, its role in populating the emptiness of Siberia, and its unique impact as a solitary thread tying Russia together. He follows its fate during the civil war following the 1917 revolution, when it became a high-stakes prize in the struggle between the Bolsheviks and their opponents. Above all, he recounts the vital role that the railroad played in saving the Soviet Union during World War II."

On the contrary, argues Petrovsky-Shtern in this important history, from the 1790s, when parts of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth were incorporated into the Russian empire, until the 1840s, shtetls were economically vibrant, culturally diverse, lively merchant communities. Had the Russians left these communities intact as the private holdings of Polish magnates, sustained by Jewish traders and businessmen and unburdened by serfdom, these areas might have remained a dynamic western outpost of the Russian empire. But beginning in the 1840s, industrialization and Russian nationalism destroyed that prospect and transformed the shtetls into something closer to the popular image that persists today. In a tour de force of archival research, Petrovsky-Shtern re-creates life in the shtetls in all its amazing richness: the whirl of trade fairs, taverns, inns, and the traditional Jewish house, alongside prolific smuggling, the social role of liquor, Jewish-Slavic relations, “kosher” sex, and the flowering of Hasidism."

True spy stories are good fun, and this one -- relating the madcap efforts of a small band of British intelligence agents sent into Russia during World War I -- is better than most. The team included Arthur Ransome, a leftist journalist who romanced Leon Trotsky’s secretary and joined the social circles of the highest Bolshevik leaders, including Lenin, and Sidney Reilly, the likely inspiration for Ian Fleming’s James Bond, who hatched a loony plot in 1918 to capture Lenin and Trotsky and overthrow the Bolshevik government. Through bravery, incredible ruses, and narrow escapes, these spies provided the United Kingdom with vital intelligence on Russia -- including information about the Bolshevik plot to foment a revolution in India, the crown jewel of the British Empire."

Plokhy claims that period is a critical and misunderstood antecedent to the entire historical era that followed. Using recently released documents, he traces in fascinating detail the complex events that led to the Soviet Union’s implosion and profiles the principal actors -- Gorbachev, Russian President Boris Yeltsin, Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk, and U.S. President George H. W. Bush -- revealing that their roles were far more complicated than is generally assumed. In particular, the Bush administration, far from seeing those months as the best moment to secure a final victory in the Cold War, was more concerned with ensuring that the Soviet Union remain intact -- its nuclear weapons under central control and its arms control arrangements with the United States secured."

Reattaching the splintered parts of a war-torn country has never been easy, but when the high representative pushed for institutional changes that would have led to police reform, the move was resisted by Serbian-dominated Republika Srpska, a critical region in the country, and things went terribly wrong. The dispute essentially reignited the Bosnian war, although without guns or bloodshed. In legal chambers, the press, and diplomatic talks, the Serbian faction waged a fully formed political and diplomatic insurgency against the international community’s effort to advance the Dayton agreement. In the end, the international community lost and the proposed changes were abandoned. Leroux-Martin reflects on that outcome and offers a highly original and practical exploration of the way that, for outside peace makers, the aftermath of a war can pose challenges almost as great as the war itself."

But he marshals 500 years’ worth of evidence so relentlessly that even a skeptic is likely to concede his basic argument: for centuries, vodka has served as a cynically employed instrument of power, a key to state finance, and a source of Russian society’s backwardness. Schrad seems to overreach only in suggesting that vodka consumption determined Russia’s victories or defeats in various wars and that the prohibition of vodka was a principal cause of the 1917 revolution. Readers will be left agog by Schrad’s tales of the bacchanals hosted by nearly every Russian tsar (and tsarina) and Joseph Stalin, and by the stunning cruelty those leaders inflicted on their loyal courtiers. Then there are the numbers: in 1680, 53 percent of state revenue came from a tax on vodka and salt, and that number remained roughly the same for much of the next two centuries. Every year, roughly 300 Americans die of alcohol poisoning; in 1994, 55,000 Russians did."
32,The Tupac Amaru Rebellion,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2014-08-18/tupac-amaru-rebellion,The Tupac Amaru Rebellion,"Empires that try to coerce their colonial subjects into financing their overseas ambitions do so at their own peril, as both George III of the United Kingdom and Charles III of Spain learned. In Peru in 1780, anger over rising Spanish taxes and the many abuses of the Spanish colonial authorities spurred a Jesuit-educated, middle-class, indigenous merchant who called himself Túpac Amaru -- claiming to descend from the last ruler of the Incan Empire -- to organize an armed rebellion with the assistance of his wife, Micaela Bastidas. But as Walker explains, the Spanish authorities quickly and ruthlessly quelled the indigenous uprising: Túpac Amaru lacked organizational skills and a clear vision and made major tactical errors, including failing to seize the strategically vital city of Cuzco. During the course of the ethnically polarized struggle, the rebels were unable to win enough public support to survive, and the powerful Catholic Church sided with the colonial authorities. Superior Spanish firepower and brutality proved decisive, resulting in the deaths of an estimated 100,000 people. To succeed, anticolonial rebellions typically require assistance from geopolitical rivals. But for reasons that Walker does not fully explore, the British showed no interest in aiding Túpac Amaru’s challenge to the United Kingdom’s rivals in Spain."
33,Banker to the Poor,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/interviews/2014-08-18/banker-poor,Banker to the Poor,"Conceived at the 1944 Bretton Woods conference to help rebuild postwar Europe, the World Bank has expanded over the ensuing 70 years into a global organization dedicated to promoting economic growth and reducing poverty -- goals it aims to meet by giving the billions of dollars in gets in contributions from developed countries to developing ones in the form of loans and grants. In 2012, U.S. President Barack Obama broke with tradition by nominating Jim Yong Kim to serve as the institution’s president. Unlike his predecessors, Kim came not from the world of finance, economics, or politics but from that of public health. Trained as an anthropologist and a physician, Kim co-founded the nonprofit Partners in Health in 1987, gaining renown for his work on drug-resistant tuberculosis. He then directed the HIV/AIDS Department of the World Health Organization, taught at Harvard Medical School, and served as the president of Dartmouth College. Kim spoke with Foreign Affairs deputy managing editor Stuart Reid at the bank’s Washington headquarters in June."

Russian President Vladimir Putin, the argument goes, annexed Crimea out of a long-standing desire to resuscitate the Soviet empire, and he may eventually go after the rest of Ukraine, as well as other countries in eastern Europe. In this view, the ouster of Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych in February 2014 merely provided a pretext for Putin’s decision to order Russian forces to seize part of Ukraine."

37,Halfway There,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2014-08-04/halfway-there,Halfway There,"Two big and important American social movements, both pioneered by the left, are heading in opposite directions. In recent years, lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) activists have scored one victory after another. Homosexuals now serve openly in the U.S. military and can legally marry in at least 19 states and the District of Columbia, and discrimination against them in other areas of public life is rapidly diminishing. At the same time, organized labor -- another (at least former) pillar of left-wing politics -- seems trapped in a downward spiral. Private-sector labor unions are struggling to survive, and organized public workers have become the villains of choice for numerous governors and state legislators. Understanding why the fates of these two great movements have diverged so dramatically reveals a great deal about the real influence of the left on American society today -- and the limits of that influence, as well."
38,Smuggler Nation: How Illicit Trade Made America,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2014-08-04/smuggler-nation-how-illicit-trade-made-america,Smuggler Nation: How Illicit Trade Made America,"Smuggler Nation is one of those rare books that compellingly reconstructs history by examining familiar events through an entirely novel lens. Andreas’ subject is the long American tradition of turning a profit by illicitly evading overbearing rules and laws imposed for reasons of national security, revenue collection, or morality. Whenever authorities have sought to deny intense consumer demand or to impose prohibitive taxes on commerce, enterprising Americans have smuggled a remarkable range of unauthorized goods: from tea, rum, and hard drugs, to condoms and pornography, to industrial technology, skilled workers, and immigrant laborers. But Andreas is no mere collector of amusing tales from the underground: rather, in demonstrating that cross-border criminality is nothing new, he counters sensationalistic fearmongers who warn that globalization presents unprecedented dangers and requires more expansive policing. Washington’s repeated overreaction to the alleged threat of illicit trade and illegal immigration has resulted in a massive, invasive, and increasingly militarized federal law enforcement bureaucracy and has badly damaged relations between the United States and Mexico, among other countries. Washington, he argues, should recognize that contraband capitalism is driven by demand and that solutions to the problem of illicit trade must address that reality. Smuggler Nation should appeal to libertarians on the right and progressives on the left alike."
39,Three Books on Trade in the Western Hemisphere,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2014-08-18/three-books-trade-western-hemisphere,Three Books on Trade in the Western Hemisphere,"In international negotiations with seemingly much stronger states, astute developing countries can sometimes successfully defend their national interests and even win major victories. Bernal, a seasoned trade negotiator, explains how, during the negotiations over an interregional free-trade agreement signed in 2008, a number of Caribbean countries extracted important concessions from the EU. Decades earlier, as Siekmeier ably documents, a revolutionary government in Bolivia managed a similar feat in its bilateral dealings with the United States."

Dramatic as the turnaround has been, it pales in comparison to Greece’s experience during the first half of the last century, when it suffered through two Balkan wars, numerous skirmishes with Turkey, a military coup, German occupation, and a bitter civil war that ran, on and off, from 1942 to 1949. It’s a bloody and confounding history that few non-Greeks even remember today, let alone understand. This singular book -- part memoir, part history -- should change that. In it, Rizopoulos, a historian and former director of studies at the Council on Foreign Relations, deftly weaves together his own implausible story -- he was raised in Athens, was orphaned at 17, and yet somehow still found his way first to the Hotchkiss School, in Connecticut, and then to Yale -- with that of his turbulent homeland. Shaped by a combination of striking detail and lack of self-pity that brings to mind Vladimir Nabokov’s Speak, Memory, the book works well as both personal narrative and political saga."

What Americans Can Learn From European Public Policies,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2014-08-04/lessons-europe-what-americans-can-learn-european-public-policies,Lessons From Europe? What Americans Can Learn From European Public Policies,"This book sets out to explore what the United States could learn about public policy from European countries. European models are increasingly cited in American public debates, often as negative examples in ideologically polarized discussions. This group of distinguished authors seeks more sober conclusions, grounded in empirical evidence. They examine rules relating to issues of work-family balance, labor-market regulations, climate change policy, urban transport, election law, pensions, and immigration. Three lessons stand out. First, Europe is a continent of extreme diversity, and so a single European model rarely exists. Second, in all but the last two areas, plenty of European policy solutions exist that the United States could learn positive lessons from. Third, although some might criticize the entire notion of learning from Europe on the ground that the United States is “exceptional,” much of the distinctiveness of the United States results from policy choices and political institutions that could be reformed, should Americans desire better outcomes from their government."
43,Land and Wine: The French Terroir,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2014-08-18/land-and-wine-french-terroir,Land and Wine: The French Terroir,"As do most books on wine, this one contains histories of famous regions and ancient vineyards, paeans to the distinctiveness of particular grapes, and florid descriptions of specific wines. And, as do nearly all wine books, it sings the praises of terroir -- the qualities that a product such as wine exhibits owing to its place of origin. Yet I have never encountered a book quite like this one. In careful detail, it tells the geological history of France, at each point linking the character of the country’s wines to the underlying geology of the land on which the grapes are grown. The story proceeds chronologically, starting 500 million years ago, when great oceans were swallowed up during tectonic shifts, and ends just 10,000 years ago, at the moment when the Strait of Gibraltar broke open and the Mediterranean ceased to be an inland sea. Throughout, one is struck by the violence and diversity of geological change and by the overarching lesson that few things are as essential to a place as its terroir."
44,The Tragedy of the European Union: Disintegration or Revival?,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/tragedy-european-union-disintegration-or-revival,The Tragedy of the European Union: Disintegration or Revival?,"This is the most honest and sensible book yet to tackle the euro crisis. Soros eschews the sanctimony and pseudoscience that frequently accompany commentary on the EU and gets right to the basic political conflicts and human foibles that underlie the union’s problems. Although he is a bit imprecise on the origins of the euro system, he explains with clarity how the single currency created a financial system dominated by incorrect assessments of risk. One result has been the eurozone’s domination by Germany, which benefits from the system in the short term and refuses to change it, blocking significant banking reform. This guarantees a long period of stagnation for southern European countries, which now find themselves in a position similar to that of developing countries that borrow in a foreign currency. Soros sees this as a “nightmare” from which Europe might never wake: for better or worse, the eurozone might not last. This book represents not merely the clear-eyed criticism of a single economist; it also marks a final loss of faith in the EU project on the part of one of its most prominent believers."
45,Is the EU Doomed?,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/eu-doomed,Is the EU Doomed?,"Zielonka is an intellectual provocateur in the best sense of the word. He has previously likened the EU to an empire; now, he claims the union is doomed to disintegrate into the governmental equivalent of polyphonic music. Underneath that strained analogy lies a serious point. Arguments over the future of Europe tend to fall into two extreme camps: the EU must either centralize power in Brussels and become a technocratic United States of Europe, as federalists advocate, or it must grant power back to national governments, as British conservatives and others desire. Zielonka argues, entirely plausibly, that neither idea would work. He suggests that decentralized networks of businesses, civil society groups, independent government agencies, EU officials, and European citizens should interact with one another in open-ended, nonhierarchical forums tailored to different issues. Some might object that such a vision simply repackages the EU as it already functions. Others might protest, as globalization theorists have for years, that any arrangement that does not formally allocate political responsibility is bound to be dysfunctional, and even dangerous. Yet this book will stimulate debate on Europe’s continuing multinational experiment."
46,Crashing the Party,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2014-08-18/crashing-party,Crashing the Party,"For the six years since President George W. Bush left office, his party has turned its back on him. Bush spoke at neither the 2008 nor the 2012 Republican National Convention. When aspiring successors to his former office mentioned him at all during the primary debates, they cited his legacy as something to avoid repeating. Yet Bush may prove much harder to ignore at the party’s next convention: one of the most mentioned possibilities for the 2016 Republican presidential nominee is the ex-president’s brother, former Florida Governor Jeb Bush."
47,Massacre in Norway: The 2011 Terror Attacks on Oslo and the Utoya Youth Camp,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2014-08-18/massacre-norway-2011-terror-attacks-oslo-and-utoya-youth-camp,Massacre in Norway: The 2011 Terror Attacks on Oslo and the Utoya Youth Camp,"Since 2001, Europe has suffered more terrorist incidents than the United States, although none of the attacks has been as spectacular as those that struck New York City and Washington on 9/11. Among the most lurid European incidents was the 2011 massacre by a lone gunman of 69 young Norwegians at a summer camp near Oslo associated with the Labour Party, which was combined with a diversionary bomb blast in the city that killed eight people. Bromark, a Norwegian journalist, tells the story based on detailed eyewitness accounts, and his book serves as a corrective to wrong-headed foreign commentary that used the event to criticize Scandinavian social democracy. Despite the xenophobic rhetoric of the perpetrator, his crime was not evidence of widespread right-wing radicalism or of lax Norwegian law enforcement. The murderer, although an adult, seems to have been a lonely outsider in a close-knit society, not unlike many of the teenagers responsible for school shootings in the United States. The most revealing anecdotes in this book illustrate something that foreigners often overlook: the deep bonds of friendship and community that continue to define what it means to be Norwegian."
48,Pitchfork Politics,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2014-08-18/pitchfork-politics,Pitchfork Politics,"Since Roman times, virtually every type of government that holds competitive elections has experienced some form of populism—some attempt by ambitious politicians to mobilize the masses in opposition to an establishment they depict as corrupt or self-serving. From Tiberius Gracchus and the populares of the Roman Senate, to the champions of the popolo in Machiavelli’s sixteenth-century Florence, to the Jacobins in Paris in the late eighteenth century, to the Jacksonian Democrats who stormed nineteenth-century Washington—all based their attempts at mass mobilization on appeals to the simplicity and goodness of ordinary people. By the mid-twentieth century, populism had become a common feature of democracy."

Their collapse in the past five decades is one of the most important changes the United States has undergone in the contemporary era, but there has been little serious thought about its meaning. An Anxious Age is a dazzling tour de force, in which Bottum offers the richest and most interesting analysis yet of this cultural shift. Whereas most conventional analyses of the decline of the Protestant establishment emphasize the rise of Catholics and Jews after World War II, Bottum argues that the Protestant establishment collapsed because of internal shifts rather than external pressure. The heirs of the mainline Protestants, Bottum argues, still set the tone for American social and cultural life, but they no longer do so in an overtly religious context. Not all of Bottum’s observations ring equally true, but any reader interested in American politics or culture needs to grapple with the insights of this fascinating book."
50,America in Decay,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/united-states/america-decay,America in Decay,"The creation of the U.S. Forest Service at the turn of the twentieth century was the premier example of American state building during the Progressive Era. Prior to the passage of the Pendleton Act in 1883, public offices in the United States had been allocated by political parties on the basis of patronage. The Forest Service, in contrast, was the prototype of a new model of merit-based bureaucracy. It was staffed with university-educated agronomists and foresters chosen on the basis of competence and technical expertise, and its defining struggle was the successful effort by its initial leader, Gifford Pinchot, to secure bureaucratic autonomy and escape routine interference by Congress. At the time, the idea that forestry professionals, rather than politicians, should manage public lands and handle the department’s staffing was revolutionary, but it was vindicated by the service’s impressive performance. Several major academic studies have treated its early decades as a classic case of successful public administration."

In The Scorpion’s Sting, Oakes surveys the legal doctrines that enabled President Abraham Lincoln to envision and then enact the Emancipation Proclamation. Under the international laws of the day, countries at war could emancipate slaves with or without compensation to masters and could either establish or ban slavery in specific territories in treaties or as acts of policy. Thus, international law allowed Lincoln to override the constitutional protection of slaveholders’ property rights. The point is not merely one of antiquarian interest; the degree to which the provisions of international law affect the rights and responsibilities of the federal government is a controversial subject today. The Scorpion’s Sting will lead readers to reflect on the degree to which international law might hold significant implications for the American system of government."

Power and Purpose in American Statecraft From Harry S. Truman to George W. Bush,"This remarkable book catapults Brands into the foremost ranks of a new generation of U.S. strategic thinkers. Brands brilliantly combines an analysis of the grand strategies of selected presidents (Harry Truman, Dwight Eisenhower, Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, and George W. Bush) with an investigation into the nature and value of the very concept of grand strategy. Throughout, his analysis is evenhanded and insightful. He argues that an effective presidency requires a conscious strategic framework even when the pressure of events makes it impossible to adhere rigidly to an overall grand design. The task of formulating a grand strategy relies less on creating rigid plans than on examining and testing the sometimes contradictory assumptions that drive U.S. policy. Future presidential administrations would do well to embrace this vision at a time when the United States faces limited resources and a bewildering array of challenges. On the evidence of this closely reasoned book, Brands will have much to contribute to the strategic debates that lie ahead."

It is best understood as Clinton’s attempt to position herself for the intense political battles she will likely face in the next few years as the front-runner for the Democratic nomination for president in 2016. Still, it is a rich and even compelling read, hinting at how Clinton wants to be seen in the culminating years of her political career. The memoir pulls off a deft political balancing act; Clinton distinguishes herself from President Barack Obama even as she highlights her loyalty to the man she served as secretary of state. Clinton ran for president in 2008 as a liberal hawk, albeit one chastened by the Iraq war, which she supported. Hard Choices indicates that she is standing her ground, and has perhaps become more hawkish and less chastened. She makes clear that she would have preferred a more muscular U.S. intervention in the civil war in Syria and highlights her deep reservations about Russian President Vladimir Putin. Meanwhile, she demonstrates her continuing liberal values by emphasizing the importance of women’s issues in her approach to foreign affairs."

In this short -- perhaps too short -- book, Barzilai, an enterprising young scholar and U.S. diplomat, has done a good job of pulling together the basic sources on this set of events. He was frustrated by his inability to use government archives but has enlivened his account through interviews with key policymakers. This story is already known, including the fact that the United States committed an insufficient number of ground forces to prevent bin Laden’s escape and that Washington was loath to take risks with the limited forces it did deploy. Barzilai also blames the outcome on a combination of political inattention and sloppy tactics. The lesson he draws is that civilian leaders need to monitor military commanders carefully and make sure they understand the political significance of operational decisions."

As this excellent volume reveals, such feelings can come to form essential parts of national mythologies, and this has been especially so in the case of World War II. Japan, for example, has only grudgingly accepted its guilt -- a task complicated, perhaps, by the fact that the Japanese can also claim that they were the victims of a terrible act of war: the U.S. nuclear attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. When China needed Japanese investment to grow its economy, Chinese officials avoided condemning Japanese brutality during the Nanjing massacre of 1937; now that China and Japan are once again locked in a fierce rivalry, some members of China’s leadership point to Nanjing as evidence of Japanese immor-ality. Unlike Japan, Germany has fully come to terms with its guilt. But German contrition has allowed others countries -- Austria, for example -- to avoid reckoning with their collaboration with the Nazis. This book explores what is normal in war and what constitutes exceptional atrocity, and it underlines the importance of independent and honest historical writing that stays close to the evidence and steers clear of mythmaking."

But the stability of the atomic age has bred complacency and reduced policymakers’ fluency with the nuances and practicalities of nuclear strategy. Those trained in the dark arts of deterrence are growing older and are not being replaced, even though the weapons live on. It is therefore important for fresh eyes to look at the dilemmas created by nuclear weapons."
57,Out of Poverty: Sweatshops in the Global Economy,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2014-08-18/out-poverty-sweatshops-global-economy,Out of Poverty: Sweatshops in the Global Economy,"This book might have been titled In Praise of Sweatshops. It is a serious attack on well-meaning European and U.S. organizations that lament the working conditions in the factories of many developing countries, sometimes calling for boycotts against the multinational firms that purchase from such factories or that even own them. But Powell argues persuasively that sweatshops, where the conditions are admittedly appalling by Western standards, represent an improvement -- often a significant improvement -- over the alternatives available to their workers. To boycott them or impose other significant additional costs on them makes life worse for many poor people by depriving them of relatively good jobs. This is especially true for women in the developing world, for whom rural life is often far worse than industrial labor in cities. The book contains a good deal of data and economic analysis, but it also addresses moral and philosophical issues and compares the labor dilemmas of the contemporary developing world with those that arose during comparable periods of British and U.S. history, when sweatshops likewise represented a step forward. One lesson of the book is hard to ignore: if Americans want more workers around the world to enjoy American working conditions, they should let more immigrants into the United States."

Meyer boldly attempts to characterize the diverse cultural practices of Asians, Europeans, and North and South Americans in eight areas: communication, performance evaluation, persuasion, leadership and hierarchy, decision-making, trust building, dealing with disagreements, and scheduling. The book abounds with well-chosen anecdotes to illustrate the misunderstandings that can arise from clashing cultural assumptions, making this enlightening book a pleasure to read."

The spread of such knowledge is also necessary to deal with climate change. Yet economists and environmentalists alike know little about the process. This useful book -- a thorough piece of practical research -- looks closely at how clean energy technologies such as gas turbines, advanced batteries, solar photovoltaics, and coal gasification emerged and spread to China. Gallagher bases her case studies not only on data and written material but also on nearly a hundred interviews she conducted with participants in the clean energy sector. She finds many of the usual problems faced by cross-border businesses. But her book also suggests some reasons for optimism. Much diffusion of technology does occur, both through direct investment and through licensing. Intellectual property issues, although present, rarely prove insuperable. China is developing new indigenous technology and even exporting it. China’s patent system is growing rapidly, and Chinese courts are gradually developing the capacity to resolve patent disputes impartially."
60,Flash Boys: A Wall Street Revolt,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2014-08-18/flash-boys-wall-street-revolt,Flash Boys: A Wall Street Revolt,"Hardly a week goes by without news of some malfeasance committed by a large American or European bank. Lewis zeros in on one particularly explosive charge: the claim that major banks engage in predatory trading behavior. Instead of filing their customers’ orders to buy and sell stocks and bonds in a straightforward way, banks have found it far more lucrative to trade those orders in “dark pools” -- private stock markets run by the banks themselves -- and to sell access to those pools to high-frequency traders who use superior technological tools to make large purchases or sales, often at the expense of ordinary customers. This has allowed the banks to game the financial system and enhance their earnings -- as well as the bonuses they pay to key employees and executives. Lewis’ main characters are a group of financial specialists who become disillusioned with this rigged system and set up a new exchange called IEX, which aims to level the playing field and treat investors more fairly. The book is a chatty exposé, rich with dialogue and character studies, and also explains complex financial processes in terms accessible to laypeople."

Two quite different factors are driving the change: people are living longer, and they are having fewer babies. The potential fiscal strains arising from greater longevity have received a lot of attention; the implications of falling birthrates, much less. With this book, Kramer aims to correct the imbalance. He believes that falling birthrates pose a serious threat to a number of wealthy countries, not only to their economic well-being but also to their national security. With a decrease in fertility comes a loss of economic vitality, an increase in dependency ratios (the number of retirement-age citizens who need the support of working-age ones), and the decline of rich countries relative to the rest of the world. Those changes might destabilize international migration. Kramer describes and analyzes the policy reactions -- or absence thereof -- to declining birthrates in France, Italy, Japan, Singapore, and Sweden. He concludes, on the basis of the French and Swedish cases, that governments can increase fertility rates with policies that make it easier for women to raise families and also pursue careers. But such approaches succeed only when governments commit to them for the long term and are willing to use public funds to pay for them.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

Power and Influence in the Global System,"Reich and Lebow have joined a long list of writers who have announced the end of U.S. hegemony and the coming of the next world order. In fact, they argue that hegemony has been dead for many decades. “Hegemony is a fiction propagated to support a large defense establishment, justify American claims to world leadership, and buttress the self-esteem of voters,” they proclaim. But they have an odd notion of what constitutes hegemony, which they equate with “the blunt exercise of force.” Reich and Lebow note that influence is far more important than raw power and identify three functions that leading states must perform to sustain order in today’s allegedly post-hegemonic international system: agenda setting (advocating policies and principles of order), custodianship (stabilizing the world economy), and sponsorship (initiating rules and institutions). These are perfectly good points, but the main critique relies on a straw man: political scientists and policymakers are well aware of the distinction between raw power and influence. Indeed, the field of international relations even has a term for the strategy of influence that Reich and Lebow advocate. That term is “hegemony.”Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

Today, at least 24 international courts and organizations review administrative decisions, assess government compliance with international law, and pass judgment on constitutional questions. These include global bodies, such as the International Court of Justice, the International Criminal Court, and the World Trade Organization, and regional legal bodies in Africa, Europe, and Latin America. These bodies have issued thousands of rulings, and, as Alter argues, they are not simply settling disputes between governments but also offering authoritative views about what it actually means to follow the rule of law in specific policy areas. In detailed case studies, Alter examines when and how such courts and organizations exercise political influence. She masterfully demonstrates how, as the idea of global governance takes root, governments increasingly take pains to be seen as following the law -- a development that has greatly increased the power of international courts and judges.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."
64,"Liberal Internationalism: Theory, History, Practice",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2014-08-18/liberal-internationalism-theory-history-practice,"Liberal Internationalism: Theory, History, Practice","The Western liberal tradition rests on free markets, limited government, human rights, and the rule of law. But as Jahn notes, those concepts originated as guides to the organization of domestic politics, and the effort to project them onto the international system, which began in the early nineteenth century, has been marked by tensions, dilemmas, tradeoffs, and contradictions. Liberal internationalism enshrines the norms of sovereignty and self-determination, for example, but it also has provided the rationale for imperialism, military interventionism, and postwar European efforts to transcend the sovereign state. In this rare and welcome survey of an important school of thought, Jahn argues that the tensions between the theory and the practice of liberal internationalism have been particularly pronounced since the end of the Cold War. During the past three decades, financial crises, the rise of illiberal democracy, and the hegemonic exceptionalism of liberalism’s most powerful advocate, the United States, have called into question the viability of a stable and universal liberal system. Jahn’s outlook is pessimistic, but her book nonetheless reaffirms why liberalism has endured thus far: the possible alternatives to a messy and incomplete liberal international order are all much worse.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

Western powers that ushered in the Industrial Revolution and the rise of the liberal order are now barely able to perform rudimentary tasks. When beleaguered Western leaders look over their shoulders, they see authoritarian Asian countries -- especially China and Singapore -- gaining ground. These two recent books offer competing but complementary visions of the past, present, and future of government."

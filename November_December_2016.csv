0,The Power of Populism,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/issue-packages/2016-10-17/power-populism,What’s Inside,"On November 8, scores of millions of voters will cast their ballots for the most remarkable presidential candidate in the history of American politics—a charismatic real estate developer turned reality TV star whose strident populism and checkered past have been denounced even by many in his own party.  Last June, meanwhile, defying most of the country’s establishment, a majority of voters in the United Kingdom opted to abruptly exit the European Union, throwing the region’s future into chaos. And elsewhere in Europe, surging populist parties now control parliamentary majorities or pluralities in six countries and share in government in three others. What tectonic shifts are generating these earthquakes? How and why has populism reemerged with a vengeance in the heart of the advanced industrial world, and what will happen next? These are the questions we try to answer in this issue’s lead package, drawing as usual on a broad range of experts from various perspectives. The package kicks off with a fascinating interview with Marine Le Pen, the second-generation leader of France’s National Front, western Europe’s flagship populist party, who endorses Donald Trump, defends the burkini ban, and calls for a “Frexit.” Then, Fareed Zakaria surveys the West’s populist revival, arguing that its roots lie in the convergence of opinion on economic policy, the divergence of opinion on culture, and a pushback against increased immigration. Michael Kazin looks at the Trump phenomenon through the history of American populism, casting the fiery candidate as the latest champion of the ethnonationalist strand of the movement, which trains its fire on nonwhite “others” below as much as nefarious elites above. Cas Mudde explores the European scene, tracing how the decades-long erosion of support for mainstream political parties created an opening for outsider challenges. And Shannon O’Neil explains why Latin America, long a region notorious for its populist political antics, has moved away from populism in recent years. Sheri Berman dispels the notion that today’s populists are fascists but warns that they are symptoms of a decline in the ability of traditional political parties on both the left and the right to satisfy the needs of most voters—a trend that could lead to even greater turmoil down the road. And Pankaj Mishra locates the West’s populist surge in a broader uprising around the world against elites who have backed neoliberal globalization while ignoring the persistence of massive inequalities. Whatever the U.S. election results turn out to be, it is clear that today’s populist revolt cannot be ignored or dismissed. New voices are being heard, new issues are being forced onto the agenda, and politics as usual is unlikely to return anytime soon."
1,The End of White Christian America,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2016-10-17/end-white-christian-america,The End of White Christian America,"The combination of a decline in the percentage of Americans who consider themselves white and a decline in the percentage of those white Americans who call themselves Christian leads Jones to announce the death of “white Christian America” and the end of the long period during which it defined the national discourse. This topic matters, but the book disappoints. Readers looking for insights into how this shift will change U.S. politics and culture won’t find much to chew on here. Jones, a product of the liberal wing of American Protestantism, seems more interested in scoring polemic points against evangelical rivals than in analyzing what he argues is an epochal transformation. It’s a missed opportunity: something is clearly happening in the world of American religion, but The End of White Christian America offers only a few tantalizing insights into what it might mean."
2,Off-Target,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2016-10-12/target,Off-Target,"Not one of the articles in your package “Tomorrow’s Military” (September/October 2016) addresses the impact of climate change on the U.S. armed forces or the world in which they will operate. Yet in a 2015 report to Congress, the U.S. Department of Defense noted that “climate change is an urgent and growing threat to our national security, contributing to increased natural disasters, refugee flows, and conflicts over basic resources such as food and water. These impacts are already occurring, and the scope, scale, and intensity of these impacts are projected to increase over time.”"
3,"Been There, Done That",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2016-10-12/been-there-done,"Been There, Done That","Fred Kaplan (“Rethinking Nuclear Policy,” September/October 2016) rightly argues that “the United States stands on the precipice of another nuclear debate,” as its leaders confront major decisions about how to modernize its nuclear forces. But his closing argument is misleading. Kaplan claims that “no civilian officials have scrutinized the U.S. nuclear war plan . . . since the review of a quarter century ago”; he concludes that “it’s long past time” for the government to review its approach to nuclear weapons, “scouring the war plan clean, as if there were no nuclear weapons at all, then building it up from scratch, based on a rational assessment of how many are needed, to do what.”"
4,"The Ghana Reader: History, Culture, Politics",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2016-12-12/ghana-reader-history-culture-politics,"The Ghana Reader: History, Culture, Politics","This collection of essays, scholarly articles, newspaper reports, poems, and song lyrics provides a wonderful introduction to Ghana and its people, stretching all the way back to prehistoric times. Opening the book to virtually any page yields a judiciously selected text that reveals something about Ghana: Konadu’s reflections on the origins of Akan ethnic identity; a poem by Abena Busia about a famous private school in Accra that sits in what was once a dense forest with spiritual significance for locals; a lovely essay by Esi Sutherland-Addy about the funeral of a traditional king in eastern Ghana. The book ends with the poet Kwesi Brew’s laud of Ghana’s resilience:"
5,"Muslims Talking Politics: Framing Islam, Democracy, and Law in Northern Nigeria",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2016-10-12/muslims-talking-politics-framing-islam-democracy-and-law-northern,"Muslims Talking Politics: Framing Islam, Democracy, and Law in Northern Nigeria","Since the mid-1990s, several states in Nigeria’s predominantly Muslim north have sought to institutionalize Islamic law (sharia). Kendhammer combines deft ethnographic research with a deep knowledge of Nigerian history and culture to examine this trend, its implications for democracy and liberalism, and the reasons why many Muslim Nigerians have welcomed it. He finds that although some northern politicians have cynically exploited Muslim fears of being attacked and marginalized in an increasingly secular society in order to promote sharia, many ordinary Muslim Nigerians required little convincing: they sincerely believe that implementing Islamic law will improve the performance of woefully deficient state administrations and legal systems, encourage economic development, and lead to a more responsive democracy. In practice, Kendhammer finds that sharia has served to strengthen the state’s regulatory apparatus over religion, and that it has also harmed the interests of non-Muslim minorities. Meanwhile, sharia’s effects on good governance and growth have been inconsistent and partial."
6,Women and Power in Postconflict Africa,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2016-10-12/women-and-power-postconflict-africa,Women and Power in Postconflict Africa,"The country with the world’s largest proportion of female legislators is Rwanda, where, following national elections in 2013, 64 percent of the seats in Parliament were held by women. In this regard, Rwanda—which barely more than two decades ago was mired in a genocidal civil war—is exceptional but not quite an exception in sub-Saharan Africa. As Tripp’s book convincingly demonstrates, countries in the region that have suffered civil wars have empowered women to a significantly greater extent than countries that have not. Based on data-rich case studies of Angola, Liberia, and Uganda, Tripp argues that since the 1990s, protracted periods of civil conflict have led to changes in the nature of gender relations. Peace agreements have contained measures, including constitutional reforms, that have mandated greater gender equality. Tripp argues that the main factors behind such steps are domestic in nature but also acknowledges the influence of the international institutions and foreign donors that have more systematically supported gender equality in the last quarter century. This is an optimistic but not misty-eyed book, and Tripp concedes that much work remains to be done in securing rights and opportunities for African women."
7,Ebola: How a People’s Science Helped End an Epidemic,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2016-10-12/ebola-how-peoples-science-helped-end-epidemic,Ebola: How a People’s Science Helped End an Epidemic,"In 2013, when the Ebola epidemic broke out in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone, many issued grim predictions about its likely impact, as it was widely believed that these desperately poor countries lacked the health-care infrastructure necessary to contain the highly infectious virus. Thankfully, the worst fears were not realized, as a large international effort helped to eventually halt the spread of the disease, although not before more than 11,000 people had died. In this provocative book, Richards argues that the international response may actually have extended the epidemic’s duration, as it offered no medical solution (no cure or vaccine is yet available) and slowed the ability of the affected populations to develop the cultural and behavioral adaptations that were ultimately the key to defeating the virus—for example, changes to practices around care for the ill and burial of the dead. Too often, the well-intentioned international response was shaped by a top-down logic that sought to impose novel practices on people rather than work with them to adapt their existing customs to the new reality."
8,Morning in South Africa,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2016-10-17/morning-south-africa,Morning in South Africa,"In the process of making the contrarian argument that South Africa’s prospects are promising despite the country’s current difficulties, Campbell has also written an excellent introduction to the South African political economy. After a concise history of the recent past, Campbell ably surveys such policy areas as economic development, health care, and education. He repeatedly concedes that South Africa’s performance since the end of apartheid has been mediocre at best, but he also sees reasons for meas-ured optimism. Inequality is rising, but some poverty alleviation has taken place. The quality of educational opportunities for black South Africans remains low, but there has been a notable increase in their overall access to education. Corruption is increasing and the ruling African National Congress shows signs of an authoritarian drift, but the judiciary remains professional and largely apolitical. Campbell’s optimism stems from his belief that the country’s democratic institutions are strong and resilient and that its people have already completed much of the hard work of building a “nonracial” democracy. Whether or not one finds that persuasive, the book’s reasonable tone and fact-based review of the record represent a useful antidote to more common alarmist accounts. Also welcome is Campbell’s call for more active and ambitious U.S. engagement with South Africa."
9,Trading With the Enemy: The Making of U.S. Export Control Policy Toward the People’s Republic of China,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2016-10-17/trading-enemy-making-us-export-control-policy-toward-peoples,Trading With the Enemy: The Making of U.S. Export Control Policy Toward the People’s Republic of China,"During the Cold War, the United States made the sensible decision to restrict the export of advanced military technologies to its chief strategic rival, the Soviet Union. In contrast, U.S. high-tech firms now need access to large and growing markets in China in order to fund the research and development that keeps them at the cutting edge of information, communications, and space technologies. Meijer charts an admirably clear path through the technological and bureaucratic complexities of his subject to show how U.S. export control policy evolved over 30 years in the direction of “higher walls around fewer items.” Under this policy, the United States has sold China a widening range of dual-use technologies, hoping to provide American firms with the financial resources to “run faster” in the innovation competition with China. The policy remains risky and has long caused controversy in the executive branch and in the U.S. Congress. But Meijer’s analysis suggests that technological and market developments have left American policymakers with few alternatives."
10,Information for Autocrats: Representation in Chinese Local Congresses,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2016-10-17/information-autocrats-representation-chinese-local-congresses,Information for Autocrats: Representation in Chinese Local Congresses,"Why do some authoritarian systems invest time and effort in maintaining fake representative institutions, such as China’s people’s congresses? These decorative “flower pots,” as many Chinese call them, rarely if ever exercise their legal powers to interrogate budg-ets or fire officials. Their delegates are elected every five years at five levels of the political system, from the township up to the national level. Manion suggests that the real purpose of the congresses is to enable delegates to lobby for local projects such as roads, bridges, schools, and clinics. In doing so, the delegates provide information that government officials need in order to secure favorable performance reviews and earn promotions. Manion’s interviews and surveys provide new details on how these important but poorly understood institutions function at the local level to support, rather than challenge, authoritarian rule."
11,Xinjiang and the Modern Chinese State,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2016-10-17/xinjiang-and-modern-chinese-state,Xinjiang and the Modern Chinese State,"Under a coating of theory about empires and ethnic groups, this book tells the blood-soaked story of three Chinese governors who ruled the turbulent territory of Xinjiang in the first half of the twentieth century. Left to their own devices by a weak central state, and facing the challenges of local nationalism and Soviet intervention, the governors kept a precarious grip as they shifted from the traditional strategy of alignment with local ethnic leaders to a new strategy, borrowed from the Soviets, of expropriating local elites on the pretext of modernizing a backward people. As other scholars have pointed out, China was the only great modern empire to enter the postcolonial era with most of its territory intact. But the price of this achievement has been harsh rule over resistant minorities. China today, Jacobs argues, is not a nation-state but a “national empire,” still struggling to integrate subject peoples into a modern state."
12,The Great East Asian War and the Birth of the Korean Nation; South Korea’s New Nationalism: The End of “One Korea”?,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2016-10-12/great-east-asian-war-and-birth-korean-nation-south-koreas-new,The Great East Asian War and the Birth of the Korean Nation; South Korea’s New Nationalism: The End of “One Korea”?,"Three decades ago, new thinking about constructed identities was spurred by the historian and political scientist Benedict Anderson’s book Imagined Communities. Anderson’s insights continue to inspire a stream of research that has grown ever more relevant in a period of rising nationalism around the world. In her final book—completed by her husband and former students after her death—the late Haboush shows that Korean identity, despite its seeming permanence, is just as historically contingent as any other. She places its origins further back than other constructivists have, tracing them to the Imjin War (1592–98), when Koreans rose up to resist an invasion from Japan. Until then, the inhabitants of the Korean Peninsula had thought of themselves as junior members of a universalistic Confucian cultural sphere. But during the war, Haboush argues, local elites invented a new rhetoric of ethnic identity in order to levy a volunteer resistance army. In order to defeat surveillance by the invaders, they started to use vernacular Korean as a medium of public communication, shifting away from the use of classical Chinese, which they had relied on until then. Haboush’s innovative research shows how Korea emerged as one of the first imagined communities, and one of the most enduring."
13,Turn of the Tortoise: The Challenge and Promise of India’s Future,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2016-10-12/turn-tortoise-challenge-and-promise-indias-future,Turn of the Tortoise: The Challenge and Promise of India’s Future,"The veteran business journalist Ninan has produced a deeply informed and readable survey of India’s problems and prospects. He labels the country a tortoise for the decades of economic policy mistakes that have left it “the last major poor country on earth.” The chief obstacle to growth has been inefficient governance and its legacy of market-stifling regulations and corruption. In the absence of an economic crisis, there has been no impetus for systemic reform. But a huge middle class is emerging and doing more for itself, independent of the government. The country has entrepreneurs, engineers, cheap labor, and a huge market; it can cope with its infrastructure problems; China and Pakistan pose security challenges but not existential threats; a set of active nongovernmental organizations has developed; and constitutional democracy is contentious but secure. For all its complexity, the vision in Ninan’s crystal ball is clear: expect annual per capita income to pass the $6,000 mark before long and for India to bid to host the Olympics as a statement that it has finally arrived as a fully developed society."
14,Powerplay: The Origins of the American Alliance System in Asia,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2016-10-17/powerplay-origins-american-alliance-system-asia,Powerplay: The Origins of the American Alliance System in Asia,"In exploring the sources of the unique “hub and spoke” alliance system in Asia—in which each of the main defense treaties involves the United States and one partner—Cha has embedded a lively narrative of post–World War II diplomatic history inside a thought-provoking analytic framework. Secretary of State John Foster Dulles and other U.S. policymakers wanted to deter communist expansion but also to restrain messianically anticommunist allies such as Taiwan’s Chiang Kai-shek and South Korea’s Syngman Rhee from launching attacks that might trigger World War III. To do so required treaty arrangements that gave the United States veto power over the Taiwanese and South Korean militaries. Washington likewise wanted what Cha calls a “neo-imperial” level of control over Tokyo’s economic and security policies so that the United States could shape Japan as its strategic cornerstone in Asia. Multilateral arrangements have proliferated in the region recently. But Cha argues that bilateral patterns continue to dominate U.S. diplomacy there because they give the United States maximum influence with minimum risk of entanglement. China is following a similar strategy, preferring whenever possible to extend economic and diplomatic influence over its neighbors one by one rather than multilaterally, although without forming military alliances."
15,America’s Continuing Misadventures in the Middle East,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2016-10-12/americas-continuing-misadventures-middle-east,America’s Continuing Misadventures in the Middle East,"Freeman brings to bear his considerable experience as a senior-level U.S. diplomat in this collection of addresses he has delivered in recent years, which appear designed to entertain as much as to enlighten. His main message is that the United States has made fundamental and perhaps irreversible blunders in its Middle East policy, of which its “abject failure” to secure peace for Israel and statehood for the Palestinians is the most egregious. Freeman pins the blame for that on the subservience of U.S. policymakers to self-destructive, obdurate counterparts in Israel. More generally, Freeman laments what he considers to be Washington’s abandonment of diplomacy in favor of war-making and sanctions regimes that he regards as counterproductive. And then there is the damage at home in the United States: conflicts in the Middle East and elsewhere, Freeman argues, have led to the erosion of constitutional norms of privacy and put the country on the path to becoming a garrison state."
16,Muted Modernists: The Struggle Over Divine Politics in Saudi Arabia,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2016-10-12/muted-modernists-struggle-over-divine-politics-saudi-arabia,Muted Modernists: The Struggle Over Divine Politics in Saudi Arabia,"Rasheed writes about a small group of Saudi intellectuals: “liberal” syncretists who blend Western ideas about civil society, checks and balances, and popular choice with the Islamic values of community (ummah), consultation (shura), and accountability (hisba). They assert that there should be a negotiated contract between the ummah and its rulers, one that is subject to change and revision. Rasheed is sympathetic to this line of thought but points out that Saudi state repression and the negative reactions that such “modernist” positions would induce in many Saudis may limit their appeal. Some of the figures she profiles emerged out of the “awakening” (sahwa) movement that followed Iraq’s 1990 invasion of Kuwait and the subsequent stationing of U.S. military personnel in Saudi Arabia. The shock of that event propelled some Saudi thinkers toward radical jihadism and others toward Islamic liberalism; for both groups, holding the regime accountable was at the heart of their concerns. Rasheed’s protagonists are not quite liberals: some have problems with the idea of gender equality; others with the idea of Shiites as the equals of Sunnis. But if there is to be reform within Sunni Islam, it will proceed with hesitations and ambiguities."
17,Syria,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2016-10-17/syria,Syria,"The subtitle of this survey of the crisis in Syria could be It’s Complicated. Abboud relies mainly on secondary sources, and he offers no unconventional insights, but he covers all the bases, and the whole of the book is greater than the sum of its parts. The stronger sections detail the Local Coordination Committees, which helped organize the 2011 uprising against the Assad regime and have managed to survive during the subsequent civil war, and the so-far fruitless missions of the un envoys Kofi Annan, Lakhdar Brahimi, and Staffan de Mistura. Abboud offers little new information on the machinations of outside actors in the Syrian conflict, such as Hezbollah, Iran, Qatar, Russia, Saudi Arabia, and the United States, none of which has achieved anything that could be seen as beneficial to the Syrian people. He eschews the idea of a peace plan built on strengthening central state institutions and instead calls for one that would rely on the decentralization of social services and investment, the repatriation of refugees, a push for job creation, and a transitional government that would include the Alawite-dominated Baath Party, the Kurds, and the Sunni jihadist al-Nusra Front—but not ISIS. Those with better ideas, please step forward."
18,The New Sectarianism: The Arab Uprisings and the Rebirth of the Shi’a-Sunni Divide,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2016-10-12/new-sectarianism-arab-uprisings-and-rebirth-shia-sunni-divide,The New Sectarianism: The Arab Uprisings and the Rebirth of the Shi’a-Sunni Divide,"Abdo argues that the Arab uprisings of 2011 did not herald the beginning of a journey toward liberal democracy; instead, they rekindled deep historical and doctrinal cleavages between Shiite and Sunni Muslims. Few would argue otherwise. More controversial is her assertion that in the eyes of most Muslims in the Middle East, the Shiite-Sunni split has become even more threatening than Israel. The sectarian antagonism cannot be explained away as merely the result of political manipulation or the exploitation of superficial identities: “Sometimes,” Abdo posits, “it is all about religion.” In Bahrain, the Sunni monarchy’s discrimination against the Shiite majority is institutionalized and deliberate. The rise of Sunni jihadists in Lebanon has been the inevitable response to the persistence of a state within a state maintained by the Shiite militant group Hezbollah. But there are also intrasectarian rifts: in the 1980s, Iran’s Shiite supreme leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, posed a bigger threat to Shiite clerics in Iraq than did Iraq’s Sunni dictator, Saddam Hussein. Abdo’s treatment of these topics is balanced, if not particularly original. What is original is her analysis of prominent self-appointed Salafi “sheiks” and their output on Twitter, where some of them have millions of followers."
19,ISIS: A History,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2016-10-12/isis-history,ISIS: A History,"Gerges has been on the trail of the Islamic State (also known as ISIS) since it emerged, under a different name, in the aftermath of the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003. The group distinguishes itself from other Salafi-jihadist organizations not primarily through doctrinal differences but rather through its embrace of extreme violence and theatrical beheadings, its hatred of Shiites, and its commitment to hold territory and govern populations as a revived caliphate. It is notable that Ayman al-Zawahiri, who now heads al Qaeda, has denounced ISIS’ poor timing and excessive violence but not its ultimate objectives. Still, isis fights rival jihadists as viciously as it does non-Muslims. In this useful book, Gerges argues that ISIS cannot survive much longer as a military force and, more important, that the group is intellectually impoverished. Moreover, its constituent parts do not share the same interests. But ISIS is the product of an “organic crisis” in Arab politics, Gerges contends, and even if the group collapses, something like it will arise again unless Sunni Muslims reject the ideas and narratives that have allowed the group to flourish."

Hamburg is exceedingly ambitious, attempting to synthesize two periods that are normally divided: the two centuries before the era of Peter the Great (which lasted from 1682 to 1725) and the century or so that followed. The first period was defined by ideas about authority, righteous rule, and social virtues that originated in the Russian Orthodox Church. By Peter’s time, Russian thinkers—many of them in or near government—were still defending autocracy, but some had also begun promoting norms and institutions that would create a more modern state, with a semblance of the rule of law and a relationship between church and state based on religious tolerance. This trend culminated during the so-called Russian Enlightenment, which took place during the reign of Catherine the Great, in the second half of the eighteenth century. What makes Hamburg’s treatment so original is the way he reveals the continuity in the complex mergers between church and state that took place across the centuries and his demonstration of how European thought echoed in Russia, even before Peter and Catherine, but without undoing the core link between religious faith and politics."

Smith acknowledges that this ground has been plowed many times, but he argues that the mystery of Rasputin remains. Smith does not pretend to have produced a definitive portrait; nevertheless, he renders in great detail the ten years that Rasputin spent on the national stage, from 1906 until his murder in 1916. Sorting through the Rasputin mythology, Smith discards the apocryphal and weighs the plausible, balancing the extraordinary mix of mysticism and debauchery that made the peasant monk notorious. Digging through countless and often conflicting firsthand accounts and impressions, Smith gives Rasputin’s mystique a depth and a fine edge missing from prior histories. In the end, readers themselves must decide whether Rasputin was a holy man with hypnotic powers or merely a charlatan. But Smith goes a long way toward making him more intelligible by exploring the fascination polite society had with the occult and the demonic during imperial Russia’s final, fateful decade."

Rather than think of the Soviet Union as a checkerboard of territorial units with Russia at its core, one could better understand it as “an empire of mobile diasporas that . . . helped construct a truly multiethnic society,” Scott writes. He explores what it meant to be Georgian outside the borders of Georgia, distinct in one’s nationality but also viewing oneself as an integral citizen in the Soviet project. He draws comparisons not only with other nationalities in the Soviet mix but also with the experiences of other empires and the United States. But his focus is on the evolving role of the Georgian diaspora: its early contributions to revolutionary politics; its growing cultural prominence, particularly in cuisine, in the 1930s; its place in post-Stalin arts and entertainment; its role in sustaining the “informal economy”; and, ultimately, its struggle to adapt when its home base was sliced away from Russia after the collapse of the Soviet Union."
23,The New Russia,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2016-10-17/new-russia,The New Russia,"Gorbachev here offers a detailed account of his thoughts, actions, and concerns from the day he resigned as president of the Soviet Union, in 1991, until today. The emotions on display are a mix of anger (giving way to undisguised hatred in the case of his successor, Boris Yeltsin), defiance, and sadness. Throughout, Gorbachev defends what he accomplished with perestroika at home and “new thinking” in foreign policy. He had hopes for Vladimir Putin, and at the outset of the Putin era, he excused a degree of authoritarianism as necessary and praised the new president’s agenda. Even when the Putin regime began to veer from the democratic path that Gorbachev had passionately defended, he blamed “the government” or “state authorities” rather than Putin himself—until roughly 2011, when his despair became comprehensive. On the Ukrainian crisis, Gorbachev punts, simply exhorting all parties to come together and find a solution. Despite his loosely formulated, sometimes backward-looking ideas, it is hard not to come away from this memoir thinking that Russia would be better off today if it were following Gorbachev’s instincts."
24,The Invention of Russia: From Gorbachev’s Freedom to Putin’s War,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2016-10-17/invention-russia-gorbachevs-freedom-putins-war,The Invention of Russia: From Gorbachev’s Freedom to Putin’s War,"Ostrovsky builds his book around two powerful contentions. First, he claims that from Soviet days to today’s Russia, mass media have been key to the system, and controlling them is the beginning and end of power. Second, he argues that Vladimir Putin’s Russia lacks a strategic vision and is driven only by the conviction “that strength [lies] in money, that there [is] no such thing as values, and that the only difference between Russian and Western officials [is] that Western ones [can] hide their cynicism better.” Regardless of whether a reader accepts these propositions, he or she will admire Ostrovsky’s eye-opening revelations about the role that media figures have played in shaping and controlling the images that have defined the Gorbachev, Yeltsin, and Putin eras. Ostrovsky makes a convincing case that the perversity of contemporary Russia is not an aberration but rather the logical result of the self-deception and misplaced hopes and ideals of the Gorbachev period, the flawed reforms and surging corruption of Boris Yeltsin’s time in power, and the crude statism and nativism that have added to even greater corruption in the Putin era."
25,In Wartime: Stories From Ukraine,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2016-10-17/wartime-stories-ukraine,In Wartime: Stories From Ukraine,"It is no small trick to convey what life is like for ordinary Ukrainians, particularly in the towns and villages where the detritus of the past remains piled high and left largely undisturbed because of the corruption that still prevails. It is more difficult still to capture the cruel mix of desolation, monotony, resignation, and pain experienced by those who remain in areas laid waste by the civil war that has raged in eastern Ukraine since 2014. Judah succeeds by traveling to these often out-of-the-way communities, poking around neighborhoods and museums, starting conversations with the people he meets, and interviewing local notables, knaves, quiet heroines, and people who are simply coping. From Lviv, in the heavily Polish-influenced west, to Bessarabia, a backwater to the south, to the epicenter of the war, in the Donbas, he reveals the links between the current conflict and the history lying beneath the emotions and memories that divide Ukrainians, brought to a sharp and ragged edge by the war."
26,Aspirational Power: Brazil on the Long Road to Global Influence,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2016-10-12/aspirational-power-brazil-long-road-global-influence,Aspirational Power: Brazil on the Long Road to Global Influence,"Over the past 20 years, prescriptions for Brazil’s foreign policy have tended to swing wildly between two extremes. When the economy is strong, as it was in the first decade of this century, intellectuals urge Brazil to seek a global role worthy of the world’s fifth-largest country in terms of population, pushing grand but perhaps ill-considered quests, such as Brazil’s 2010 effort to mediate the international dispute over Iran’s nuclear program. When the economy is weak, as it is now, observers wag their fingers and suggest that Brazil put its global ambitions on hold until its own house is in order. But there is a middle path, which Mares and Trinkunas illuminate with admirable clarity. They argue that despite its recent troubles, Brazil remains “likely to one day emerge as a great power.” But, they add, its rise would be hastened by more fully embracing its role as a big, if often messy, democracy. Aligning with authoritarian China and Russia through the BRICS group, and failing to condemn their abuses, has diminished Brazil’s otherwise promising soft power in recent years, the authors contend. A more principled approach, siding instead with India, South Africa, and even nontraditional partners such as South Korea, would win Brazil more friends, power, and influence in the world—regardless of swings in the economy."
27,Cultural Code: Video Games and Latin America,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2016-10-17/cultural-code-video-games-and-latin-america,Cultural Code: Video Games and Latin America,"If you think that video games—wildly popular across all socioeconomic strata in Latin America—are meaningless child’s play, think again: they are a big business and exert significant cultural influence. But video games are hardly pernicious agents of global homogenization. In fact, games designed in Latin America often transmit local cultural and political content, even as they appeal to a global marketplace. Penix-Tadsen argues that critics of video games too often focus on their basic narratives, missing many location-specific references. Decoding the games, grasping their sarcasm and parody, requires a sense of humor. Moreover, video games also represent a form of “virtual tourism,” taking players into the slums of Rio de Janeiro, the Aztec temples of central Mexico, or the streets of Latino neighborhoods in Los Angeles. In Latin America’s robust and growing video design industry, Penix-Tadsen optimistically sees a boom reminiscent of the one produced by the region’s magical realist literature in the 1960s. Sensing opportunity, policymakers have begun promoting local software designers, sponsoring start-up events and industry incubators, providing business financing, and protecting intellectual property rights."
28,Creating Charismatic Bonds in Argentina: Letters to Juan and Eva Perón,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2016-10-12/creating-charismatic-bonds-argentina-letters-juan-and-eva-peron,Creating Charismatic Bonds in Argentina: Letters to Juan and Eva Perón,"Juan and Eva Perón forged powerful emotional bonds with the Argentine people when Juan served as president from 1946 until 1955. Having worked in radio, Eva understood the power of melodrama in popular communications; her triumphal appearances on the balcony of the presidential palace remain deeply imbedded in the Argentine psyche. Making use of newly discovered letters written by common Argentines to the Peróns, Guy argues that the couple’s charismatic connection to the public was formed as much by the people as by Juan and Eva themselves. These bonds, she argues, were not merely fleeting and personal but deep and collective; they helped shape the country’s nationalist identity and Argentines’ sense of citizenship. Moreover, Guy finds that the political foundation of Peronism was not only the organized working class but also the very poor internal migrants—especially women and children—who at the time of Perón’s rise were moving in waves from rural areas to Buenos Aires. Guy’s archival explorations have yielded a useful addition to the unflattering or even disdainful portrayals that dominate the English-language literature on the famous couple and their brand of authoritarian populism."
29,Reflections on Memory and Democracy,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2016-10-12/reflections-memory-and-democracy,Reflections on Memory and Democracy,"We remember historical tragedies in the hope of drawing lessons and not repeating past errors. This collection of essays asks whether, by recalling the evil deeds of authoritarians and by delivering justice to victims of state violence, societies can strengthen their democratic systems. The elegantly crafted contributions cover means of historical memory as diverse as investigative journalism, Mayan oral histories, and Argentine fiction. At times, the authors assert causal relationships between historical truth commissions, judicial punishments, and victim compensation, on the one hand, and the legitimacy and sustainability of democratic institutions, on the other. Alas, these case studies are too few in number and too specific to particular times and places to allow for robust generalizations, as Grindle recognizes in her introduction. Still, they are worthwhile on their own terms, especially Marjorie Agosín’s poetic tribute to the Chilean women whose weavings created powerful visual tributes to their disappeared relatives; Sergio Bitar’s courageous reflections on Chilean politics, which forcefully distinguish between pragmatic coexistence and genuine reconciliation; and a profound essay on moral reciprocity by Salomón Lerner Febres, the former chair of Peru’s Truth and Reconciliation Commission."

In retrospect, the 1990s were the golden age of inter-American diplomacy, as the OAS partnered with the leading powers of the Western Hemisphere to safeguard democracy whenever it was threatened, in places such as Guatemala, Haiti, and Paraguay. But in the decade that followed, the rise of populist caudillos challenged the legitimacy of liberal democracy and its protectors, paralyzing the OAS. Latent tensions within the organization’s mission and constitution came to the fore: between democracy promotion and the principle of nonintervention, between the powers of the OAS’ secretary-general and those of its Permanent Council of Ambassadors, and between the ethos of full consensus and the goal of institutional effectiveness. Perina concludes with a detailed list of recommendations for returning the OAS to its former glory while correcting its errors. With the retreat of authoritarian rule in important countries such as Argentina, the time may be right for Perina’s well-informed proposals for how to reinvigorate inter-American diplomacy."

In a model of historiography, Dyson and Maes assemble biographical vignettes of ten economists and economic policymakers, including Robert Triffin and Jacques Delors, who helped establish the euro. Although these people differed in their specific visions of monetary union, they agreed on a few basic principles—most of which the eu has failed to live up to. They believed that the union should encourage symmetrical adjustment, rather than disproportionately burdening countries that run budget deficits, as the current system does. They agreed that the eurozone should include only a small number of core states with convergent economies, rather than the larger, divergent set of countries that eventually joined. And they agreed that a functioning monetary union would require extensive banking, fiscal, and political cooperation, in contrast to the minimalist system that emerged."
32,Towards an Imperfect Union: A Conservative Case for the EU,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2016-10-12/towards-imperfect-union-conservative-case-eu,Towards an Imperfect Union: A Conservative Case for the EU,"It is puzzling that so many American and British conservatives are vocal critics of the eu. The union’s Brussels-based institutions employ fewer bureaucrats than a typical small city government, tax and spend only about two percent as much as their member states, and are primarily dedicated to goals such as free trade, deregulation, quashing state subsides, facilitating the free movement of capital and labor, and coordinating international policing, counterterrorism, and defense efforts. So why don’t Anglo-American conservatives praise the eu? Rohac does. He argues persuasively that the eu is a force for peace and prosperity that, on balance, promotes the precepts of the libertarian philosopher Friedrich Hayek. He argues that rather than seek to weaken Brussels, conservatives should work to strengthen and reform eu institutions. Rohac does not paper over the union’s flaws, especially the growth-inhibiting euro. But he concludes that the answer to Europe’s problems is more union, not less. Although Rohac doesn’t always argue his case rigorously and sometimes recycles questionable criticisms of Brussels, his book is an original corrective to unthinking (and often mendacious) Euroskepticism on the right."
33,The Nazi Hunters,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2016-10-12/nazi-hunters,The Nazi Hunters,"The last former Nazis are dying out, and so, too, are those whose life’s work was to hunt them down. Nagorski tells their stories evenhandedly, uncovering a fascinating cast of characters from all over the world and placing their efforts in a broader perspective. He describes how Nazi hunters first aimed to exact revenge without trials, how early court cases were exploited to present dubious hearsay that convicted former Nazis in the court of public opinion, and how Germany and other countries eventually lost interest in prosecuting former Nazis. Later, however, authorities established proper judicial proceedings, in Nuremberg and elsewhere, that made it impossible to credibly deny the crimes of the Holocaust. Out of this experience, moreover, came greater public awareness of genocide as a global problem and new norms of international justice to combat it—including the clear principle that “following orders” is not a valid excuse for committing crimes of this type, which has since been applied in places as far afield as Cambodia, Chile, and Rwanda. In the end, Nagorski concludes, some good can come out"
34,Karl Polanyi: A Life on the Left,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2016-10-17/karl-polanyi-life-left,Karl Polanyi: A Life on the Left,"The Hungarian sociologist Karl Polanyi, who eventually settled in Canada, was one of the most prescient and persuasive political economists of the mid-twentieth century. In pioneering historical analyses, he argued that a “great transformation” took place in the early nineteenth century that systematically destroyed the premodern systems of welfare and social justice and established unfettered free markets—and thus reduced individual laborers to expendable commodities. His basic premise, drawn from Marxist theory, was that unregulated markets are based on political coercion. They also generate inequality, which those who support market liberalization foster misleading ideologies to justify. After World War II, Polanyi, like most social democrats, supported political reforms that would institute the redistribution of wealth and impose restrictions on private property rights, thereby reversing the great transformation. If such premises and prescriptions seem old-fashioned, it is because we have moved recently toward a more globally integrated, privatized, financialized, and in some respects unequal and socially segregated world—changes accompanied by a partial return to nineteenth-century values. That reversal would surely have shocked and baffled Polanyi, but it also serves to render this clear explication of his provocative ideas all the more timely and relevant."
35,Hillbilly Elegy: A Memoir of a Family and Culture in Crisis,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2016-10-11/hillbilly-elegy-memoir-family-and-culture-crisis,Hillbilly Elegy: A Memoir of a Family and Culture in Crisis,"Vance’s account of his childhood and adolescence in a self-described “hillbilly” family in a languishing Ohio mill town opens a window onto a world that Americans need to see and understand more clearly. When European immigration to the United States essentially ended after 1924, both African Americans from the South and whites from Appalachia were recruited by manufacturers to fill expanding factories. The decline of industrial employment in the last few decades has left both blacks and whites bereft of jobs and subject to the forces of social decay, made worse in both communities by habits of violence and the presence of drugs. Vance’s tale of how he made it to Yale Law School (via the Marine Corps and Ohio State University) is a moving human story in itself; it will also help nonblack Americans look at the problems of urban poverty through fresh eyes, undistorted by the prism of race. This isn’t a story with an obvious political agenda; Vance does not conclude with a ten-point plan for a new War on Poverty. Readers, however, are likely to come away with the feeling that although it may be harder to address the needs of American communities left behind by the economic transition than people once thought, it is more important than ever to try."

Anderson reminds readers that white rage has a long history in the United States and that it has frequently come in response to black progress. Her book tells the story of Reconstruction and Jim Crow in harrowing terms, using specific incidents of white violence against blacks to personalize the horror. She looks to the northern states as well, showing how white mobs viciously attacked middle-class black families who tried to buy homes in white neighborhoods. Anderson writes as a passionate advocate rather than as a dispassionate historian, and at times, she undermines her own credibility, as when she links the genesis of the crack epidemic to Reagan administration efforts to fund the Nicaraguan contras. Nevertheless, for readers who want to understand the sense of grievance and pain that many African Americans feel today, White Rage offers a clearly written and well-thought-out overview of an aspect of U.S. history with which the country is still struggling to come to terms."

Going back to the nineteenth century, The Star and the Stripes notes a continuing oscillation in the American Jewish community, between prioritizing the problems of Jews around the world and pushing for the alleviation of suffering and persecution more generally. Barnett identifies a time of “peak communalism” after the 1967 Six-Day War, which led to an upsurge in Jewish pride and identification with Israel. The communal era continued through the 1970s, encouraged by the plight of Soviet Jews desperate to emigrate. But since 1980, Barnett finds, growing qualms about Israeli policies have led many American Jews to step away from the communal agenda. This, he notes, has led some American Jewish philanthropists to support Palestinian rights groups: by 2005, “American Jewish organizations ranked among the top donors to Palestinian organizations, providing anywhere from 20 to 30 percent of their total grants.” One wishes Barnett had cast his net a little wider: as Henry Kissinger and many others would remind him, humanitarianism is not synonymous with foreign policy for American Jews any more than for anyone else."

But even if Levin won’t be asked to write policy memos for the next president, The Fractured Republic makes important contributions to the national debate that will resonate on both sides of the aisle. He starts from the position that since the 1950s, American society has steadily lifted restrictions on individualism. The left welcomes the diversity of lifestyles and the enhanced capacity for self-expression among minorities that this shift has brought, but deplores the economic individualism and inequality it has also encouraged. The right takes the opposite view: economic individualism, good; breakdown of public conformity to Judeo-Christian norms on sex and family, bad. Yet as Levin notes, both sides yearn for the sense of solidarity and national unity associated with the postwar era. Levin suggests that, rather than indulging in misplaced nostalgia, both the left and the right should think about how to build a new and more inclusive national identity that reflects and welcomes the diversity of American life in the twenty-first century."

He is quite defensive on the Romans’ behalf, noting that the idea of empire went out of fashion only rather recently, and argues that the Romans deserve credit for managing to rule disparate lands for centuries, and most of the time without too much trouble. At the same time, he does not deny that the emperors’ motives were hardly altruistic or that their methods were often cruel and brutal. And at no point did the Romans ever doubt their right to dominate: the question was how others would accommodate themselves to Roman rule. But the Romans understood the value of alliances, and they treated the tribes that were prudent enough to surrender to the empire with relative grace; indeed, many of the conquered peoples adopted the conqueror’s ways."

Nelson also captures well the chaotic decision-making in Tokyo in the run-up to the attack, when a militaristic faction gained the upper hand and overrode the mis-givings of more cautious officials, who realized that however well the attack went, it was bound to end in disaster for Japan. And so it did. Owing to the Americans’ failure to take basic precautions, the Japanese navy enjoyed far more surprise and caused more damage than it should have been able to—but the bombings could never have delivered a knockout blow. The attack demonstrated the difficulty of anticipating when an enemy might act irrationally. Still, the complacency of the American side remains remarkable."

Budiansky tells the story of U.S. efforts to crack the Soviets’ codes, which proved difficult to do after 1948, even with the benefit of the most powerful computers available. His story begins in the 1940s and ends in 1989, but a lack of declassified material from the more recent decades forces him to focus on the years prior to the mid-1960s. Budiansky ably guides readers through the technical details of code breaking and the bureaucratic wrangling that so often bedevils intelligence work. He illuminates a number of U.S. successes and credits the National Security Agency with helping demonstrate that the bark of Soviet leaders was worse than their likely bite. But he is also critical of the nsa’s missteps, including its tendency to capture far more material than it could ever hope to analyze and its readiness to spy on Americans at the behest of U.S. President Richard Nixon."

In these writings, Whaley was less interested in whether the actions in question were successful than in their conception and implementation. Whaley offers advice on how to institutionalize the practice of deception and leavens his guidance with a sense of humor rarely witnessed in discussions of such matters. Whaley recounts various ruses, such as pretending that a big move is imminent (or, alternatively, that one has been delayed), and discusses the use of double agents. Many of his examples are taken from World War II, when militaries (especially the British one) had a better appreciation than they do today of the benefits of misleading opponents about one’s real intentions and strengths. This enjoyable guide to the more mischievous side of military history will have enduring value for instructional purposes—and also as a tribute to one of the great students of the subject."

Elvis Presley, who spent some time in the U.S. Army, makes only fleeting appearances: the real focus of this rich, readable book is the institutional transformation of the army from the end of World War II to the eve of Vietnam. This was a time of great upheaval, as the military had to constantly adjust in the face of rapid postwar demobilization, the shock of the Korean War, debates about nuclear conflict (and whether an army would be needed at all), the changes under way in American society, and the ebb and flow of the Cold War. Linn is relentlessly honest, detailing not only positive elements of the story, such as the important role the army played in desegregation, but also negative ones, such as the army’s bureaucratic rigidity, the dubious radical right-wing and racist views held by some of its senior commanders, and its futile and damaging effort to figure out how it could use nuclear weapons in a tactical manner. At all times, Linn keeps the focus on ordinary gis and their coping strategies, reflected in Elvis’ advice to new soldiers: “Play it straight and do your best.”"

It covers a wide range of issues, some expected (the provision of clean water, the preservation and delivery of vaccines) and others less familiar (the prevention of infectious outbreaks on cruise ships). Many of the studies involve attempts to encourage or discourage particular behaviors, such as efforts to persuade individuals with chronic diseases to take their prescriptions and the incentives that the Affordable Care Act created to get more Americans to purchase health insurance. A central theme is that consumers now have more information available to them than ever before—some of it unreliable—regarding health, occupational safety, medical providers, and treatments. This growing knowledge will increasingly shape business performance in the health arena in rich and poor countries alike."

She details how they set up far-flung networks of trusts, shell corporations, and foundations to protect the wealth of high-net-worth individuals—and to conceal it from tax authorities, creditors, and potentially acquisitive family members. Wealth managers not only exploit gaps in legal systems but also seek to influence legislation, especially in offshore tax havens, to the benefit of their clients. In doing so, they preserve and even increase wealth inequality and help undermine the legitimacy of governments that tolerate their wealthy citizens’ evasion or avoidance of the financial responsibilities that everyone else must meet—a form of shirking made easier by modern communications technology. Harrington advises governments seeking to address inequality to focus not only on the rich but also on the professionals who help them game the system."

But the main rationales for doing so have varied. This fine model of social science research explores the history of income and inheritance taxes in 20 North American and European countries and critically evaluates several hypotheses for why there have been such great differences within and between countries. Although advocates for taxing the wealthy at high rates often invoke “fairness,” ideas about what is fair differ greatly. Through careful statistical analysis, Scheve and Stasavage reject the most common explanations for why governments choose to impose high rates on the rich—for example, to address rising inequality. They conclude, instead, that the most common justification is “comparable sacrifice,” a rationale that has proved especially successful immediately after periods of heavy military conscription, which often disproportionately affects the poor and leads to calls for “wealth conscription.” Corporations, however, seem mostly immune to this dynamic, which helps explain why globalization has led to greater overall declines in corporate tax rates than in the rates applied to high-income individuals."

The question of the deal’s likely effects has now become a major political issue in the United States: the TPP is the focal point in an epochal fight over the future of U.S. policy toward foreign trade and investment. Strong opposition to the agreement—neither major presidential candidate supports it—reflects the rise of populist-tinged antiglobalization and protectionism. Like all recent trade agreements, the TPP is excruciatingly complex and detailed, mostly as the result of special-interest influence. With this volume, a team of experts from the Peterson Institute for International Economics has produced an indispensable guide to the issue, one intended for nonspecialists. They look past the politics and describe and evaluate the deal’s most important attributes and implications: what it would do and, equally important, what it would not do. The team is not happy with everything the negotiations produced but believes that, on balance, the TPP will be overwhelmingly beneficial to the United States."

Mallaby’s masterful biography—which doubles as an excellent economic history of the past three decades—tells a story of Greenspan’s technocratic ascent, from his modest boyhood in New York City, to a young adulthood colored by his philosophical attraction to the antigovernment libertarianism of the novelist Ayn Rand, to his career as a high-flying economic consultant, and finally to his rise to the pinnacle of power at the Fed. But the maestro’s reputation suffered a severe blow in the wake of the financial crisis of 2008, which many blamed on policies that Greenspan had developed and applied. Greenspan later admitted that he was blinded by his faith in the idea that the world of private finance was led by rational individuals fully aware of the risks they were taking—a system that he wrongly believed could essentially regulate itself. Throughout his career, Greenspan proved politically astute, reluctant to take on any battle that he could not win, which perhaps explains some of his hesitation to confront the dangerous asset bubble that was obviously building during the early years of this century."

All global powers want access to and influence in every region, and the rise of hostile states that seek to close off and dominate their neighborhoods jeopardizes that goal. Montgomery argues that a hegemon will support a rising regional state if that country’s growing power counterbalances another state in the region that is hostile to the hegemon or if the rising state might become a regional leader that supports the global hegemon. By the same token, if the rising power is hostile or threatens to disturb the regional balance, hegemonic opposition will follow. For evidence, Montgomery turns to detailed historical cases of British efforts to manage the rise of three regional powers during the nineteenth century: Egypt, the American Confederacy, and Japan. Montgomery also looks at the U.S. response to the rise of India amid power struggles in South Asia in the 1960s and to the threat that Iraq posed to the regional order in the Persian Gulf during the administrations of Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush."

In this collection of essays, he argues that the international system is in the midst of a protracted, perilous, but ultimately progressive movement from what he calls “the old geopolitics” to “a new geopolitics.” As Falk sees it, the old order—defined by a Western-dominated system of states and by global capitalism and realist ideology—is incapable of solving the cascading problems of armed violence, environmental catastrophe, despotism, corruption, and human suffering. For Falk, even the liberal internationalist vision of enlightened state leaders working through the un and other global bodies is insufficient to the task. Falk provides no blueprint for an alternative order, but he believes that rising non-Western states and transnational civic actors will pursue new forms of collective action, mobilizing peoples and societies to work toward more just and sustainable forms of political community, and that global spending on military power will be redirected to progressive social purposes."

In this groundbreaking book, Ripsman argues that successful peacemaking requires both approaches. Initial breakthroughs rely on governments’ negotiating formal peace settlements, often over the objections of their publics. But for the agreements to endure, rival states need to earn the buy-in of their societies, and this requires the long, slow work of groups working to strengthen economic and cultural ties between the two countries. Ripsman draws these conclusions from detailed studies of the peacemaking between France and Germany after World War II and Israel’s peace processes with Egypt in the 1970s and Jordan in the 1990s. In each case, a formal agreement was necessary to settle territorial disputes and prevent violence, and leaders were motivated by statist and geostrategic interests. But the move from what the scholar Alexander George called a “precarious peace” to a “stable peace” happened only when individuals and groups on both sides made efforts to change hostile attitudes and build trust."

In this illuminating study, Kennedy tells a different story, in which contemporary international relations play out as a continuous struggle between technocratic elites around the world, in which nothing is ever settled and everything is negotiable. Technocrats have not supplanted powerful states and capitalist interests at the top of the global power hierarchy, but their rise has changed how the major players maneuver for advantage. Kennedy focuses on the “knowledge work” of experts in areas such as development, human rights, and national security. He is particularly interested in international law, which seeks to enshrine universal rights and protections but, as Kennedy points out, also plays a role in legitimating power and entrenching influence. In Kennedy’s portrait of the world, geopolitics, nationalism, and grand ideological projects disappear into a thousand points of contention. And with lawyers and experts firmly tied to existing power structures, it is unclear what means exist for genuine reform."
53,Reordering the World: Essays on Liberalism and Empire,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2016-10-11/reordering-world-essays-liberalism-and-empire,Reordering the World: Essays on Liberalism and Empire,"The liberal tradition has long had a deeply fraught relationship with imperialism. In the late nineteenth century, British liberals embraced free trade, individual liberty, and the rule of law, while also defending the United Kingdom’s empire. In recent decades, liberal internationalist ideas have found their way into arguments in favor of humanitarian intervention, preemptive war, and campaigns to spread democracy—all of which critics often deride as imperialism in new guises. Bell’s masterful study represents one of the best efforts yet to untangle the many ideological and political knots that bind liberalism and imperialism. In a series of rich intellectual portraits of leading Victorian-era thinkers (including John Stuart Mill, Herbert Spencer, and L. T. Hobhouse), Bell shows that most British liberals at that time saw empire as a necessary—or even vital—part of the liberal project that “civilized” states were pushing forward. Only much later, after two world wars and long struggles against fascism and communism, did the liberal vision became a more universal secular creed whose ideological and political principles could be reliably seized on by opponents of empire."
54,The Envoy,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/interviews/2016-10-17/envoy,The Envoy,"After serving five terms in the U.S. Senate—including four years heading the Foreign Relations Committee—and surviving one unsuccessful run for president, John Kerry became President Barack Obama’s secretary of state in February 2013. Since then, Kerry, a decorated Vietnam veteran, has been in near-constant motion, logging more miles than any of his predecessors (1,281,744 at last count). On September 13, Kerry met with Foreign Affairs’ managing editor, Jonathan Tepperman, in Washington to discuss his tenure and his plans for his last months in office. They spoke again on October 11, after a deal Kerry negotiated with the Russians over Syria collapsed; their second conversation is appended below."
55,How to Succeed in the Networked World,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/world/how-succeed-networked-world,How to Succeed in the Networked World,"Foreign policy experts have long been taught to see the world as a chessboard, analyzing the decisions of great powers and anticipating rival states’ reactions in a continual game of strategic advantage. Nineteenth-century British statesmen openly embraced this metaphor, calling their contest with Russia in Central Asia “the Great Game.” Today, the TV show Game of Thrones offers a particularly gory and irresistible version of geopolitics as a continual competition among contending kingdoms."

57,The Borrowers,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/review-essay/borrowers,The Borrowers,"World history is at least as old as Herodotus and Thucydides, but self-conscious “global history” is a recent development in the academy. More than a hundred books with those words in the title have been published this century, up from a handful in the prior two decades and zero before that. At their best, such studies are able to see past the limits of national histories, exploring the interconnections and flows of people, goods, ideas, and events across time and space. As the German historian Jürgen Osterhammel has put it, they can illuminate “the relationship between general developments and regional variants,” putting familiar stories in a new perspective."
58,The Drone Revolution,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/review-essay/drone-revolution,The Drone Revolution,"It is a measure of how much the United States’ security has improved since the more dangerous moments of the Cold War that the most troublesome issues in the military field today concern not weapons of mass destruction but targeted killing. The power that comes with access to the nuclear codes, of course, remains foremost when considering a presidential candidate’s fitness for office. Yet no American leader has authorized the use of nuclear weapons since 1945. The last two U.S. presidents have regularly authorized the elimination of alleged Islamist terrorists."
59,The Great White Nope,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/review-essay/2016-10-17/great-white-nope,The Great White Nope,"Most Americans are optimistic about their futures—but poor and working-class whites are not. According to a recent analysis published by the Brookings Institution, poor Hispanics are almost a third more likely than their white counterparts to imagine a better future. And poor African Americans—who face far higher rates of incarceration and unemployment and who fall victim far more frequently to both violent crime and police brutality—are nearly three times as optimistic as poor whites. Carol Graham, the economist who oversaw the analysis, concluded that poor whites suffer less from direct material deprivation than from the intangible but profound problems of “unhappiness, stress, and lack of hope.” That might explain why the slogan of the Republican presidential candidate, Donald Trump—“Make America Great Again!”—sounds so good to so many of them."
60,Europe’s Ugly Future,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/europes-ugly-future,Europe’s Ugly Future,"Some foreign policy decisions hang like albatrosses around the necks of the states that made them. For the United States, the war in Iraq offers the prime example of a costly and seemingly irreversible blunder. For Europe, it is the adoption of the euro. Fifteen years ago, when the EU established its single currency, European leaders promised higher growth due to greater efficiency and sounder macroeconomic policies, greater equality between rich and poor countries within a freer capital market, enhanced domestic political legitimacy due to better policies, and a triumphant capstone for EU federalism. Yet for nearly a decade, Europe has experienced just the opposite."
61,The Crisis in U.S.-Israeli Relations,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/review-essay/2016-10-17/crisis-us-israeli-relations,The Crisis in U.S.-Israeli Relations,"Is the U.S.-Israeli relationship in serious trouble? Do the public disputes of the past few years—over Iran, the Palestinians, and the state of Israel’s democracy—represent nothing more than the latest round of a long-standing family feud, or do they amount to a more fundamental breach? And is there anything the next U.S. president can do to repair the relationship?"
62,France’s Next Revolution?,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/interviews/2016-10-17/france-s-next-revolution,France’s Next Revolution?,"As the youngest daughter of Jean-Marie Le Pen, the founder of the right-wing French political party the National Front, Marine Le Pen grew up in politics, starting to campaign with her father at 13. Trained as a lawyer, she won her first election in 1998, as a regional councilor, and in 2011, she succeeded her father as party leader. She soon distanced herself from his more extreme positions, and eventually—after he reiterated his claim that the Holocaust was a “detail” of history—she expelled him from its ranks. These days, in the wake of the European migrant crisis, the terrorist attacks in Paris and Nice, and the Brexit vote, Le Pen’s nationalist, Euroskeptical, anti-immigrant message is selling well. Recent polls show her as a leading candidate for the presidency in 2017, with respondents preferring her two to one over the Socialist incumbent, François Hollande. Le Pen spoke with Foreign Affairs’ deputy managing editor Stuart Reid in Paris in September."
63,Erdogan’s Journey,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/turkey/2016-10-17/erdogans-journey,Erdogan’s Journey,"What happened to Recep Tayyip Erdogan? The Turkish president came to power in 2003 promising economic and political liberalization. But under his rule, Turkey has instead moved in a profoundly illiberal, authoritarian direction—although not toward repressive Islamism, which some feared was Erdogan’s true agenda, given his background in Islamist politics. Rather, Erdogan has become something more akin to a traditional Middle Eastern strongman: consolidating personal power, purging rivals, and suppressing dissent."
64,Egypt’s Nightmare,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/middle-east/2016-10-17/egypts-nightmare,Egypt’s Nightmare,"On January 25, 2011, tens of thousands of Egyptians took to the streets, demanding an end to the nearly 30-year rule of President Hosni Mubarak. Eighteen days later, Mubarak stepped down. In Tahrir Square, the crowds cried, “Lift your head high, you’re an Egyptian.” “We can breathe fresh air, we can feel our freedom,” Gamal Heshmat, a former member of parliament, told The New York Times. “After 30 years of absence from the world, Egypt is back.”"
65,The Cruise That Changed China,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2016-10-10/cruise-changed-china,The Cruise That Changed China,"On September 2, 1985, the SS Bashan cruised through the green-leaved gorges of the Yangtze River, its prow breaking the waters along its 259-foot length. Inside, the river’s shifting light played off the hallways, staterooms, and modish decorations, and air conditioning kept the late-summer heat at bay. The luxurious cruise ship had entered service earlier that year, with room for nearly 150 passengers curious to see sights advertised as “inspir[ing] romantic poets and painters with [a] sense of timelessness, awesome beauty, and endless energy.” But the spacious decks of the Bashan were strangely empty."
66,Salvaging Brexit,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-kingdom/salvaging-brexit,Salvaging Brexit,"On June 30, a week after the British public voted to leave the EU, Theresa May gave a speech launching her candidacy for prime minister in which she declared, “Brexit means Brexit.” Her message was straightforward: even though she herself had supported remaining in the EU, she would not hesitate to implement the will of the voters. Yet months after assuming office, May has yet to answer crucial questions about what a British exit, or Brexit, would mean for trade, immigration, and financial services. It is still not at all obvious what Brexit will actually look like."
67,The Rebalance and Asia-Pacific Security,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2016-10-17/rebalance-and-asia-pacific-security,The Rebalance and Asia-Pacific Security,"In April, I laid a wreath at the Manila American Cemetery, in the Philippines, where some 17,000 Americans are buried. Looking up at the mosaic maps of battles whose names still echo throughout the U.S. Department of Defense—Guadalcanal, Midway, Leyte Gulf, and more—it is hard not to appreciate the essential role that the U.S. military has long played in the Asia-Pacific. Many of the individuals buried in the cemetery helped win World War II. For the people and nations of the region, they also won the opportunity to realize a brighter future."
68,The Globalization of Rage,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/world/2016-10-17/globalization-rage,The Globalization of Rage,"In September 1919, the Italian poet Gabriele D’Annunzio gathered a force of 2,000 mutinous troops from the Royal Italian Army, along with hundreds of other volunteers, and stormed the city of Fiume, on the Adriatic coast, which had been contested territory since the end of World War I. D’Annunzio had served as a fighter pilot in the war, and his daring feats had turned him into one of the most famous people in Europe. An ultranationalist, he had long wanted “Mother Italy” to seize all the territories that he believed rightly belonged to her. In 1911, he had zealously supported Italy’s invasion of Libya, an imperialist adventure whose savagery stoked outrage across the Muslim world. In Fiume, he saw a chance to realize his dream of rejuvenating Italy through war."
69,Populism Is Not Fascism,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2016-10-17/populism-not-fascism,Populism Is Not Fascism,"As right-wing movements have mounted increasingly strong challenges to political establishments across Europe and North America, many commentators have drawn parallels to the rise of fascism during the 1920s and 1930s. Last year, a French court ruled that opponents of Marine Le Pen, the leader of France’s National Front, had the right to call her a “fascist”—a right they have frequently exercised. This May, after Norbert Hofer, the leader of Austria’s Freedom Party, nearly won that country’s presidential election, The Guardian asked, “How can so many Austrians flirt with this barely disguised fascism?” And in an article that same month about the rise of Donald Trump, the Republican U.S. presidential candidate, the conservative columnist Robert Kagan warned, “This is how fascism comes to America.” “Fascist” has served as a generic term of political abuse for many decades, but for the first time in ages, mainstream observers are using it seriously to describe major politicians and parties."
70,Latin America’s Populist Hangover,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/americas/2016-09-27/latin-america-s-populist-hangover,Latin America’s Populist Hangover,"On the morning of October 17, 1945, thousands of protesters in Buenos Aires marched on Argentina’s main executive building, the Casa Rosada, to demand the return of Vice President Juan Perón, who had been forced to resign a week earlier. The day was hot, and many of the men took off their jackets and even their shirts. This earned them the mocking title of los descamisados—“the shirtless.” Perón’s supporters promptly reclaimed the insult and turned it into a badge of honor. When Perón ran for president in the 1946 election as an unabashed populist, he toured the country in a train he named El Descamisado after his followers."
71,Europe’s Populist Surge,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/europe/2016-10-17/europes-populist-surge,Europe’s Populist Surge,"The year 2015 was a dreadful one for Europe in general and for the EU in particular. It started with the terrorist attack against the magazine Charlie Hebdo in Paris and ended with an even more deadly jihadist assault in the same city. In between, the EU battled an economic crisis in Greece, which threatened the entire eurozone, and endured a staggering inflow of refugees from the Middle East and other war-torn regions."
72,Trump and American Populism,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2016-10-06/trump-and-american-populism,Trump and American Populism,"Donald Trump is an unlikely populist. The Republican nominee for U.S. president inherited a fortune, boasts about his wealth and his many properties, shuttles between his exclusive resorts and luxury hotels, and has adopted an economic plan that would, among other things, slash tax rates for rich people like himself. But a politician does not have to live among people of modest means, or even tout policies that would boost their incomes, to articulate their grievances and gain their support. Win or lose, Trump has tapped into a deep vein of distress and resentment among millions of white working- and middle-class Americans."
73,Populism on the March,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2016-10-17/populism-march,Populism on the March,"Donald Trump’s admirers and critics would probably agree on one thing: he is different. One of his chief Republican supporters, Newt Gingrich, describes him as a “unique, extraordinary experience.” And of course, in some ways—his celebrity, his flexibility with the facts—Trump is unusual. But in an important sense, he is not: Trump is part of a broad populist upsurge running through the Western world. It can be seen in countries of widely varying circumstances, from prosperous Sweden to crisis-ridden Greece. In most, populism remains an opposition movement, although one that is growing in strength; in others, such as Hungary, it is now the reigning ideology. But almost everywhere, populism has captured the public’s attention."

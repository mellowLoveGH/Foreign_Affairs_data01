That happened largely because the Western great powers hunkered down in the face of economic and geopolitical crisis, turning inward and passing the buck, each hoping that it might somehow escape disaster. But there was nowhere to run or hide, and catastrophe swept over them regardless."
1,Omar al-Bashir and Africa’s Longest War,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2016-12-08/omar-al-bashir-and-africas-longest-war,Omar al-Bashir and Africa’s Longest War,"Omar al-Bashir has ruthlessly ruled Sudan since 1989. In 2009, his alleged role in orchestrating mass violence against civilians in Darfur earned him the distinction of being the first sitting head of state to be indicted by the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity. Moorcraft was granted a remarkable amount of access to Bashir and his closest advisers and presents the Sudanese president as a leader treated unfairly by the West and as an often reluctant actor in the terrible events that have marked his reign. It’s an unpersuasive portrait and one that oddly makes Bashir seem not particularly interesting. Prior to the coup that brought him to power, Bashir was a career army officer, and the book focuses on military tactics and campaigns. More about Bashir’s legendary skills as a political tactician and Machiavellian wielder of power—the keys to his remarkable longevity—might have made for a more valuable and credible book."
2,The Paradox of Traditional Chiefs in Democratic Africa,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2016-12-08/paradox-traditional-chiefs-democratic-africa,The Paradox of Traditional Chiefs in Democratic Africa,"Across contemporary Africa, modern states coexist with traditional institutions such as chiefdoms and kingdoms. Some of these predate colonialism, such as the kingdom of Buganda in Uganda. In other cases, colonial powers looking for clients to help them assert control, particularly in rural areas, elevated the status of existing traditional authorities or even simply invented new ones. Post-independence governments initially promised to eliminate what they viewed as retrograde, antidemocratic institutions. But most chiefdoms have survived, and in many cases, they have even gained in stature and legitimacy. As Baldwin notes in her exceptional new book, the region’s democratization in the last two decades has paradoxically strengthened unelected traditional chiefs. With her creative use of different types of evidence, Baldwin argues convincingly that voters have come to appreciate how traditional chiefs serve as “development brokers” who lobby politicians for more social services and better infrastructure. For their part, politicians rely on chiefs for help in carrying out development projects. Baldwin is a bit vague on the motivations of the chiefs themselves but argues that they generally avoid self-dealing out of a sense of commitment to their communities."
3,Beyond Timbuktu: An Intellectual History of Muslim West Africa,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2016-12-08/beyond-timbuktu-intellectual-history-muslim-west-africa,Beyond Timbuktu: An Intellectual History of Muslim West Africa,"Medieval Timbuktu was a wealthy city whose great libraries allowed it to flourish as a center of learning and scholarship. Kane’s compelling intellectual history of West Africa places Timbuktu within a much broader tradition of Islamic learning in the region, which was home to other medieval knowledge centers and which continues to advance the study of Arabic philology even today. Kane wants to show that West Africa has been much more central to Islam than has been typically understood. His wide-ranging book focuses on the intellectual traditions of the region and its role in the production and circulation of key Arabic-language texts regarding religion, law, and ethics. Kane is far less interested in the political and economic history of the area, making only passing references to the trans-Saharan slave and gold trades that enriched it and to its colonization by France and the United Kingdom."
4,This Present Darkness: A History of Nigerian Organized Crime,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2016-12-08/present-darkness-history-nigerian-organized-crime,This Present Darkness: A History of Nigerian Organized Crime,"Ellis, a British journalist and an accomplished historian of African affairs, passed away in 2015. This was his final work, and it characteristically combines mastery of the subject with elegant, lively writing. Despite its title, the book is not really about “organized crime,” at least in the usual sense of that term, which denotes large, well-structured, hierarchical organizations engaged in illicit business. Instead, Ellis analyzes the fraud, political corruption, and general criminality that has plagued Nigeria for the last century, most of which stems from small, flexible networks of individuals. Emblematic of this kind of activity are the Internet-based scams that Nigerians perfected in the early years of this century, in which a con artist would promise someone a large sum of money if only the target would provide a much smaller amount up-front. Ellis reveals that Nigerians were at the forefront of such gambits as far back as 1920. More substantively, he skewers the culture of self-enrichment and brazen corruption that has plagued Nigerian politics since the country gained its independence."
5,Spies in the Congo: America’s Atomic Mission in World War II,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2016-12-08/spies-congo-americas-atomic-mission-world-war-ii,Spies in the Congo: America’s Atomic Mission in World War II,"The uranium used to build the first U.S. atomic bombs came from the Shinkolobwe mine in Katanga Province in what was then the Belgian Congo. The mine was attractive because it yielded an especially fine grade of uranium, and it would serve as a main source of material for the U.S. nuclear arms program well into the 1950s. The focus of Williams’ engaging book is the challenge posed by transporting thousands of tons of uranium 1,500 miles, by rail and truck, from the mine to the Atlantic coast, and then moving it by ship and airplane to the United States—all in the middle of World War II. After Belgium’s defeat and occupation by Germany, the Belgian Congo formally sided with the Allies. But the colony was not without its Nazi sympathizers, particularly when it seemed as though Germany might win the war. So the Americans also had to make sure that the Nazis did not find a way to tap into the area’s uranium mines for their own nuclear efforts. The story’s main players sometimes seem like stock characters: the handsome young American spy from Idaho; the mean-spirited, racist Belgian colonial official. But plenty of intrigue livens up the narrative, and Williams also offers a useful discussion of the strategic issues both sides faced."

Here, he reports that post-Mao reforms have only extended the official abuse that characterized life under Mao. The peasants’ view of local government is shaped by their memories of suffering during the famine of 1958–61, when local cadres forced them to comply with disastrous policies set by Beijing. Now they see a new generation of cadres exploiting ostensible reform policies to oppress them yet again, this time with unfair taxes, corruption, police abuse, inflated electricity prices, and election manipulation. The villagers fight back, ineffectively, with small acts of resistance and by petitioning to higher levels. But the problems are so deep that Thaxton discerns a “total loss of trust” in government, which could someday lead to armed rebellion, if the government showed signs of weakness. Whether things are this bad all over China is an open question. But Thaxton’s research casts a dark shadow over the sunny conventional wisdom about China’s rural reforms."

In this informative survey, Ghosh estimates that there are 50 million migrants, refugees, and stateless people in the region, among them populations transferred during wartime among Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan; caste and religious groups fleeing persecution; and Afghans, Chinese, Nepalese, Rohingyas, Sri Lankan Tamils, Tibetans, and others who have fled violence or repression during the past seven decades. These population movements have added to the already daunting complexity of societies in the region, intensifying political volatility and sharpening security issues. With the exception of Afghanistan, no South Asian states are party to the UN Refugee Convention. Still, compared with other regions, South Asia has treated its refugees relatively well, partly through assistance programs and partly through benign neglect. Most migrants have gotten jobs, and many have even become citizens of their countries of refuge."

After Pakistan carried out a nuclear test in 1998 in response to tests conducted by India, its intelligence and military leaders believed that the nuclear umbrella would give them the cover to conduct a proxy war against India built around undeclared armed operations, hijackings, terrorist incidents, and the destabilization of Afghanistan. They were right. But MacDonald shows in dramatic detail how this obsession with India (and in particular the problem of a divided Kashmir) undermined Pakistan’s democracy and economy, how peace opportunities were lost, and how Islamabad lost control of militant groups that it had initially fostered. Meanwhile, India has pulled ahead in the economic and diplomatic competition between the two countries. MacDonald also criticizes U.S. policy in the region, which has tilted toward India but not as far as she believes it should."
9,Philippine Politics: Possibilities and Problems in a Localist Democracy,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2016-12-08/philippine-politics-possibilities-and-problems-localist-democracy,Philippine Politics: Possibilities and Problems in a Localist Democracy,"The Philippines is a large country (its population exceeds 100 million) divided into many small parts (over 7,000 islands and 42,000 administrative villages), which are often further split into clans controlled by rival oligarchs—and then fractured yet again by feuds within those clans. Although the country’s national institutions are strong on paper, White finds that the local trumps the national, as clientelism and violence work their way up to the very top of the system. Money, undue influence, and violence permeate the executive branch, Congress, and the judicial system, leading to stagnation and polarization in the country’s economy and politics. An active civil society and occasional eruptions of “people power” have done little to change the Philippine way of politics. White’s analysis of these problems is comprehensive. Writing before the election of Rodrigo Duterte to the presidency last year, White correctly predicted that the modest reforms introduced by the previous president, Benigno Aquino III, were unlikely to last."

The selective and demanding Manchurian Military Academy and Japanese Military Academy instilled in their cadets a firm belief in willpower, discipline, total mobilization, and risk taking. Park displayed these characteristics in spearheading South Korea’s explosive industrial development while also ruling as a ruthless dictator. The book is not a biography, but it uses Park’s early career as a window onto Japanese militarism, which shaped the ethos of the men who later guided the first decades of an independent South Korea."

But few have studied one of the most important institutions in any authoritarian system: the political police. Greitens’ original and well-researched analysis uses case studies—Taiwan under Chiang Kai-shek and Chiang Ching-kuo, the Philippines under Ferdinand Marcos, and South Korea under Park Chung-hee and Chun Doo-hwan—to explore the different ways that dictators organize this coercive apparatus. She finds that they tend to fragment it into multiple competing organizations when they want to guard against coups, but they integrate and streamline it when they are worried about popular resistance. She also finds that better-organized and more penetrative coercive systems tend to use less violence than fragmented ones, since they do a better job of spying on citizens and deterring dissent."
12,Strategic Coupling: East Asian Industrial Transformation in the New Global Economy,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2016-12-08/strategic-coupling-east-asian-industrial-transformation-new,Strategic Coupling: East Asian Industrial Transformation in the New Global Economy,"The theory of the “developmental state” has shaped understandings of how the East Asian “tiger economies” flourished from the 1960s through the 1980s. It attributed their successes to wise interventions by government technocrats. But starting in the early 1990s, states began to be less effective and global markets started becoming more complex, forcing East Asian companies to find ways to compete on their own. Those who succeeded linked up (or, as Yeung says, “coupled”) with ever-larger and more elaborate global supply chains in one of three ways. Some provided cutting-edge design and manufacturing services to leading brands (as Taiwan’s Foxconn did for Apple). Others, including big shipbuilding firms in South Korea and Singapore, learned to specialize. And still others broke out as global brand names, such as Acer in Taiwan and Samsung, LG, and Hyundai in South Korea. This is a fascinating and richly informative contribution to the field of business history and to the study of the political economy of advanced industrial development."

This book offers little new information. Its strongest sections chronicle the long and successful battle of the U.S. Treasury Department to inflict crippling financial controls and sanctions on Iran. Solomon stresses, however, that Congress had to push the Obama administration hard to get it to apply the maximum pressure. He suggests that a desire to negotiate successfully with Iran came to dominate the administration’s Middle East policy. Solomon argues that in order to get to yes with Iran, Barack Obama declined to support the Iranian demonstrations protesting the results of the 2009 election; chose not to respond with military force when Iran’s ally, Syria, used chemical weapons in the summer of 2013; and did not challenge Iran’s meddling in Iraqi politics. And Solomon points out that the final nuclear agreement required major U.S. concessions regarding Iran’s centrifuges, enrichment facilities, and heavy-water facility. In about ten years, when the deal’s main terms expire, we will know whether Obama gave away too much."

It spearheaded all of Iran’s engagements during the Iran-Iraq War. The IRGC’s Quds Force, commanded by the redoubtable Qasem Soleimani, has internationalized the Iranian Revolution by involving itself in conflicts in Lebanon, Iraq, Syria, and Yemen. And the IRGC’s domestic feeder organization, the Basij militia, has been a bulwark of internal support for Iran’s supreme leader, Ali Khamenei. Ostovar provides a careful and dispassionate history of the organization and its domestic and foreign exploits. The IRGC cannot be reduced to a vanguard of impassioned religious warriors, although that aspect of it is important. It has economic interests to protect and is closely allied with Khamenei. Ostovar asks but does not answer the question of whether the next supreme leader will follow Khamenei’s example and ally himself closely with the IRGC or align himself more with the preferences of Iranian civil society. Whatever course he chooses, the IRGC will rely on its proven survival instincts. Donald Trump will be the seventh U.S. president it has confronted."
15,The Rope,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2016-12-08/rope,The Rope,"“I am the distillation of 5,000 years of your history,” the deposed Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein, a Sunni, declares to two Shiite guards as he awaits his execution by hanging in 2006, in Makiya’s fictionalized account of what took place at the gallows. One of those guards is the protagonist of Makiya’s novel, a beautifully written cri de coeur that takes place in the years following the U.S. invasion in 2003, of which Makiya was an early and vocal proponent. The book’s young hero, a follower of the Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr, witnesses the wreckage wreaked by every group of Iraqis, but particularly by his fellow Shiites, many of whom had a chance to build a different Iraq but succumbed to deceit, greed, and treachery. (The occupying Americans were doubtless guilty of stupidity but not of masterminding the debacle that followed the invasion.) At the novel’s heart are the deaths of a father and a son. The revered Ayatollah Abul Qasim al-Khoei died in 1992 while imprisoned by Saddam; his son Abdul Majid al-Khoei was murdered in 2003, allegedly at the behest of Sadr, who saw him as a rival. Their specters haunt the lives of the protagonist’s family and close friends, one of whom becomes a killer of Sunnis whose preferred weapon is a power drill."
16,The Land Is Full: Addressing Overpopulation in Israel,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2016-12-08/land-full-addressing-overpopulation-israel,The Land Is Full: Addressing Overpopulation in Israel,"Tal, one of Israel’s leading environmentalists, unabashedly embraces a Malthusian vision of contemporary Israel: there are too many Jews and too many Arabs. In its zeal to reverse the legacy of the Holocaust, the state has pursued disastrous pro-natal policies, such as providing financial awards to couples who bear children and housing subsides to large families. Israel’s carrying capacity has been greatly outstripped; the country is heavily dependent on imports for food. Nevertheless, voices such as Tal’s are dismissed as unpatriotic, even anti-Semitic. Tal’s book occasionally wanders as it uses the theme of overpopulation to explore a wide range of topics, such as Israeli society’s patriarchal values and the status of women in the country. Other topics, such as agricultural self-sufficiency, are left dangling. Despite Israel’s pro-natal agenda, total fertility is trending down in all sectors of society. Tal urges the government to reverse course and try to accelerate that trend, but he doesn’t say whether or not he favors a suspension of Jewish immigration. He implies, however, that the country is unlikely to witness future influxes on the scale of the nearly one million Jews who arrived from the Soviet Union and the post-Soviet states between 1989 and 2006."

The authors reject a one-state solution, arguing that it would inevitably disintegrate into a violent and uncontrolled partition. They call on U.S. President Barack Obama, as he approaches the end of his time in office, to emulate his predecessors Bill Clinton and George W. Bush by issuing a comprehensive but purposefully imprecise declaration of principles on how to resolve the conflict. Obama’s successor in the White House, they write, should build on that declaration to relaunch negotiations—but only if the antagonists accept the general validity of the U.S. principles. The authors should have put more flesh on the bones of their account of the two years (2009–11) that Mitchell spent as Obama’s special envoy for Middle East peace. They also make scant mention of Mitchell’s long career in the U.S. Senate and refer only briefly to the lessons Mitchell learned as one of the architects of the 1998 peace agreement in Northern Ireland."

Khalid’s lucid, rich history of the country’s origins will add considerable depth to readers’ understandings of the array of forces that shaped this important part of Central Asia in the 1920s. In particular, Khalid demonstrates how much more complicated the Soviet Union’s formation appears when viewed from the perspective of the regions, rather than exclusively through the prism of the aims and actions of those in the Russian center. In Uzbekistan, the process was indeed intricate. Some Uzbeks bought into the Bolshevik agenda but not its premises, and there was as much friction among key Uzbek factions as there was between the Uzbeks collectively and their new Soviet colonizers. Khalid focuses on the relationship between the Bolshevik vanguards sent from Moscow in the early years after the revolution and the progressive Muslim intelligentsia known as the Jadids, who were already an established force at that point. The two groups shared a commitment to modernizing Uzbek society, but the Jadids sought to transform a nation rather than to wage a revolution built around class struggle. Although Stalin eventually silenced the Jadids, Khalid argues that the dynamic tension between these contending forces during these early years produced a golden age in Uzbek culture and the foundations of the Uzbek state."
19,The Last Days of Stalin,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2016-12-08/last-days-stalin,The Last Days of Stalin,"Most students of the Soviet Union think they know the story of Stalin’s death in 1953 and the confusion that followed it, but in most cases, they likely do not—or at least they don’t know many of the details that Rubenstein here unearths. Unlike most accounts of Stalin’s demise, Rubinstein’s book makes clear how the episode was excruciatingly drawn out over weeks and how it produced a great deal of drama in foreign capitals. Rubenstein also reveals the likely lethal (although ultimately unrealized) plots that Stalin had developed against some of the longest-surviving members of his entourage and his designs for a vast crusade against Russian Jews that, had Stalin lived to see it through, would have gone beyond the anti-Semitic horrors he had already unleashed. Rubenstein skillfully narrates the tale of the political maneuvering among shaken successors in the months after Stalin’s death and carefully recounts the newly installed Eisenhower administration’s confused response to the tyrant’s passing. Washington, Rubenstein argues, squandered an opportunity to engage productively with the new leadership in Moscow in the narrow window that opened between Stalin’s death in March and the Berlin uprising three months later."
20,Opposing Forces: Plotting the New Russia,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2016-12-08/opposing-forces-plotting-new-russia,Opposing Forces: Plotting the New Russia,"For three days in April 2015, Michnik, the lion of Polish revolutions from 1968 to 1989, and Navalny, the Russian opposition figure and anticorruption crusader, discussed a wide array of topics: the merits and drawbacks of lustration after a revolution; how to deal with corruption; their views of Mikhail Gorbachev, Boris Yeltsin, and Vladimir Putin; nationalism; the Russian Orthodox Church; and Russia’s troubled relations with the West. The conversation flows naturally and yields valuable insights. Navalny comes across as an impatient and frustrated but thoughtful insurgent. Michnik emerges as a steely, principled democrat who has been through it all, including dozens of arrests and time spent in prison. He is remarkable for his tolerance, his willingness to forgive those with whom he has fought, and his deep commitment to dialogue. Over the course of the book, those qualities seem to rub off on Navalny, who displays more nuance than observers usually attribute to him, especially when it comes to what critics often claim to be his crude nationalist views."

His focus is on the period from 1801 to 1917, when this “prison without a roof,” where tsars and serf-owning lords sent undesirables—brigands, murderers, prostitutes, and those who simply annoyed the powerful—swelled with growing numbers of political dissidents and revolutionaries. In this lush mosaic laced together with fluent prose, Beer profiles prisoners of all sorts, narrating their ordeals and the stomach-turning punishments they endured. He gives special attention, however, to the exiled instigators of the Decembrist revolution of 1825. After they arrived, Siberia became an unlikely crucible of rebellion. Siberian exiles never accounted for more than five percent of the Russian population, but that still added up to a million people over the course of a century. For the sake of comparison, consider that the United Kingdom shipped only around 160,000 criminals to penal colonies in Australia over the course of 80 years."
22,Putin Country: A Journey Into the Real Russia,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2016-12-08/putin-country-journey-real-russia,Putin Country: A Journey Into the Real Russia,"Garrels, knowing that Moscow is not Russia, chose the city of Chelyabinsk as her portal into “Putin country.” Located east of the Urals, the city was once closed to nonresidents owing to the sensitive military facilities it housed. Garrels first visited it in 1993, when the city was in the midst of a chaotic transition from the old system to a new one. Her impressions from that year serve as a water line against which she measures the dramatic changes she encountered on return visits that began in 2012. Garrels met people from every corner of the city: young professionals, the parents of disabled children, single mothers, LGBT residents, doctors, religious fundamentalists, drug addicts, schoolteachers, and more. She tells their stories with sensitivity, and her reporting is driven by a highly intelligent curiosity. In the end, one comes away with a portrait of contemporary Russian society that is deeper and more vivid than the ones often presented by data-laden sociological studies."
23,The Discovery of Chance: The Life and Thought of Alexander Herzen,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2016-12-08/discovery-chance-life-and-thought-alexander-herzen,The Discovery of Chance: The Life and Thought of Alexander Herzen,"If you read only one book related to Russia this year, this should be it. Kelly’s magisterial intellectual biography of Alexander Herzen not only creates a complete image of the remarkable nineteenth-century Russian philosopher and revolutionary but also reveals the roiling intellectual currents that engulfed Russia’s intelligentsia during each stage of Herzen’s life. In many ways, he was a man of our times as much as his own. The philosophical problems that he struggled with (the essence of freedom, the role of providence in human affairs), his dramatic intellectual evolution, and his final embrace of chance and contingency as the core of his political thought: all have resonance today, when power is often wielded by people who embrace teleological certainties. Kelly masterfully traces the intellectual currents to which Herzen contributed, alongside Montesquieu, Francis Bacon, and dozens of lesser-known eighteenth-century thinkers, and reveals the influence that figures such as Ludwig Feuerbach, Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, and Saint-Simon had on Herzen. Above all, in elegant detail, Kelly establishes how central science was to Herzen’s life and thought. Herzen did more than anyone else—certainly more than the social Darwinists or the Leninists—to fuse Darwin’s insights into a philosophy of history."
24,Peru: Staying the Course of Economic Success,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2016-12-08/peru-staying-course-economic-success,Peru: Staying the Course of Economic Success,"Ever since recovering from the miserable, debt-laden 1980s, the Peruvian economy has performed remarkably well. From 1993 to 2014, Peru’s annual GDP growth averaged over five percent, poverty levels declined by more than half, and the middle class swelled. High global prices for commodities and massive Chinese spending and investment helped, but the International Monetary Fund claims some credit as well. In this comprehensive volume, rich with detailed technical analysis, notable Peruvian economists and IMF officials assess the many structural reforms that allowed Peru’s economy to become more efficient, stable, and resilient. Some of those reforms, such as liberalizing trade rules and making it easier to fire workers, fit the neoliberal paradigm. But others, such as strengthening tax authorities and regulatory institutions and promoting public-private partnerships in infrastructure projects, show the more pragmatic side of the IMF. Nonetheless, even smart policymaking can have negative unintended consequences: for example, reallocating mineral revenues to source communities has widened inequalities between the country’s regions. The authors recognize that, despite stellar progress, much more remains to be accomplished, notably in the areas of education, health, and gender equality and in extending governmental authority into the more remote rural zones."
25,Toussaint Louverture: A Revolutionary Life,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2016-12-08/toussaint-louverture-revolutionary-life,Toussaint Louverture: A Revolutionary Life,"Toussaint Louverture was born a slave in 1743, but at the zenith of his power, he ruled all of Hispaniola, the Caribbean island that consists of present-day Haiti and the Dominican Republic. In this deeply researched and highly sophisticated biography, Girard walks the reader through the bewildering series of maneuvers through which the wily Louverture rose to power during history’s only major successful slave rebellion. But his legacy is contested: to resurrect the sugar plantations, which he considered the island’s only viable source of wealth, Louverture deployed his professionalized military to impose labor conditions that were almost as bad as slavery. Eventually, Louverture overreached, when he challenged the authority of the early nineteenth century’s most powerful autocrat, France’s Napoleon Bonaparte. Imperial and spiteful, Napoleon sent an overwhelming expeditionary force to capture Louverture, a move that backfired by empowering Louverture’s far more radical and violent deputy, Jean-Jacques Dessalines, who formally declared Haitian independence and consolidated his power by ordering the slaughter of the remaining white population. The roots of modern-day Haiti’s maladies—strongman rule, violent racial strife, economic disorgan-ization, and oppressive poverty—can be traced to these apocalyptic events."

The bulk of his work was devoted to modern Europe, but he traveled to Latin America during the 1960s and early 1970s and witnessed a diverse continent in social upheaval—developments that appealed to his Marxian perspective. This collection of essays and reviews he wrote during that period, although reflective of the times, holds up remarkably well. It is refreshing to be reminded throughout that even for a person blessed with Hobsbawm’s intellectual powers, it is immensely difficult to foresee the future. Although his political sympathies are clear, he avoids the sarcastic bombast characteristic of some left-wing commentary. And he calls it like he sees it: writing in 1971, he chastised the ill-fated Allende government in Chile for lacking a long-term vision; in another essay, he wrote that Ernesto “Che” Guevara more closely resembled the hard-nosed Lenin than the romantic Lord Byron."

Relations with Mexico can sometimes become fraught, owing in part to the politics of immigration in the United States and to lingering resentment in Mexico over the nineteenth-century U.S. annexation of Mexican territory. In contrast, Canada is a staunch U.S. ally and a committed member of NATO. Indeed, The Harper Era in Canadian Foreign Policy asks whether who is in power in Ottawa even matters much for Canadian foreign policy, given the depth of Canada’s collaboration with its far more powerful partner to the south. Not surprisingly, the contributing authors find more continuity than change in Canadian foreign policy, regardless of who serves as prime minister and whether he or she leads a majority or a minority government. Even so, Stephen Harper of the Conservative Party, who held the office from 2006 to 2015, had an impact on Canadian political culture: he mimicked U.S. neoconservatism by advocating military interventions, de-emphasized North American trilateralism, reduced public funding for his ideological opponents in academia and the nonprofit sector, narrowed the range of Canada’s human rights advocacy, and sought to separate the issue of reproductive rights from the broader issue of gender equality. Despite Harper’s aggressive language, however, defense spending as a percentage of GDP declined during his tenure. Interestingly, in a convergence with long-standing U.S. political practice, Harper more closely aligned Canadian foreign policy with the interests of certain immigrant and ethnic groups."
28,Corbyn: The Strange Rebirth of Radical Politics,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2016-12-08/corbyn-strange-rebirth-radical-politics,Corbyn: The Strange Rebirth of Radical Politics,"Jeremy Corbyn is perhaps the most radical politician to head the British Labour Party in half a century. He lacks personal charisma, a significant record of legislative achievement, and any realistic prospect of leading his party to victory over the Tories in a parliamentary election. His views on world politics—a mix of praise for the UN, support for disarmament, opposition to global capitalism, and a tepid attitude toward the EU—appeal to an archaic version of British leftism. This book by a Marxist British journalist seeks to explain and justify the enthusiastic support that Corbyn has gained from many Labour Party members. Corbyn, Seymour argues, is a spokesman for those left behind by the twenty-first-century economy, similar in that respect to Marine Le Pen, Bernie Sanders, and Donald Trump. Corbyn may sometimes seem diffident and even hapless, but the United Kingdom needs a “movement politician” who can make use of social media and assemble large rallies of the faithful. Seymour’s book is by turns inspiring and implausible. Yet it is required reading for those trying to puzzle through the rebirth of more extreme parties in Western democracies."

His first masterpiece, If This Is a Man (known in the United States as Survival in Auschwitz), was first published in Italian in 1947 and described in horrifying detail how Auschwitz turned inmates into beasts—an insight based on his own experience as a prisoner there. His subsequent writings examined how memories of the Holocaust placed barriers between survivors and those who never experienced the camps. He committed suicide in 1987 by throwing himself down a stairwell. This book tells the little-known story of Levi’s brief time as a member of the Italian antifascist resistance. He faced complex moral dilemmas, notably the decision to murder fellow partisans so that the group as a whole could survive—a step that eventually led to Levi’s internment at Auschwitz. Luzzatto, an award-winning Italian historian, writes in a sensitive and insightful manner about times and troubles no one should forget."
30,From Convergence to Crisis: Labor Markets and the Instability of the Euro,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2016-12-08/convergence-crisis-labor-markets-and-instability-euro,From Convergence to Crisis: Labor Markets and the Instability of the Euro,"This book analyzes the ongoing eurozone crisis on the basis of a simple but penetrating insight about the domestic politics of the currency union’s member states. Johnston rejects the flawed notion that the crisis is the result solely of government overspending or a one-time financial shock. Instead, she borrows the “varieties of capitalism” theory, which maintains that each European state has institutions for regulating economic activity that differ fundamentally from those of its neighbors. For example, the powerful, centralized unions of northern European countries such as Germany have long tended to eschew wage increases in the interest of maintaining export competitiveness. Prior to adopting the euro, southern European countries with less centralized labor-market institutions tended to offset wage increases by depreciating their currencies or tightening monetary policy. After the introduction of the euro, northern countries could continue to use their preferred strategy. But the single currency made it impossible for southern countries to do so. This explains why the crisis has damaged even those European countries that maintain sound fiscal policies and why the extended application of austerity measures has not restored the continent to economic health."
31,The Global Chancellor: Helmut Schmidt and the Reshaping of the International Order,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2016-12-08/global-chancellor-helmut-schmidt-and-reshaping-international,The Global Chancellor: Helmut Schmidt and the Reshaping of the International Order,"Helmut Schmidt served as chancellor of West Germany from 1974 to 1982. He earned near-universal respect for his unique combination of working-class directness, practical intelligence, and artistic ability. (He was a talented pianist who once performed and recorded a Mozart concerto.) Yet he is not generally considered a successful politician. Schmidt lacked the personal charisma of his predecessor, Willy Brandt, and never enjoyed the comfortable parliamentary majorities and unique diplomatic opportunities that later benefited his successor, Helmut Kohl. But Spohr makes the case that Schmidt’s chancellorship was defined by foreign policy successes. Schmidt was a pragmatist who joined French President Valéry Giscard d’Estaing in creating the European Monetary System and helped implement NATO’s “dual-track decision,” which combined an increased deployment of ballistic missiles to Europe and an offer to negotiate with the Soviet Union. The Soviets saw the deployment as a provocation and rejected the offer, bringing down Schmidt’s government and ushering in the end of détente—but probably hastening the Soviet collapse, as well. Although Spohr sometimes exaggerates the impact of Schmidt’s achievements, she has done readers a service by crafting a well-documented English-language treatment of this leading twentieth-century statesman."

For Brands, the collapse of the Soviet Union was only one facet of a broader transformation brought about by globalization, democratization, and technological change; the Soviet demise was catalyzed but not caused by the policies of the Reagan administration. The broader shifts began well before the Reagan presidency, and the Ford and Carter administrations had already begun to reposition U.S. policy in ways that responded to those changes. Brands emphasizes that the unipolar moment was neither as overwhelming nor as dramatic as many analysts believed in the 1990s, and he does a good job of showing how the same trends that created the halcyon atmosphere at that time would later complicate the work of U.S. strategic planners. Making the Unipolar Moment is both important and engaging; specialists and general-interest readers alike will find it a pleasure to read."

Bush, and Obama administrations all pursued that agenda without the necessary prudence and discretion. Miller stresses the importance of prioritizing: not all causes and not all regions are of equal importance to U.S. foreign policy. Africa, he argues, has historically been “the least important region strategically to the United States,” and “its relative unimportance to the United States remains the same.” As a burgeoning supply of unconventional hydrocarbons makes Middle East oil less globally important, Miller says, the United States should “repudiate the Carter Doctrine,” the commitment that President Jimmy Carter made in 1980 to ensure the security of the Persian Gulf’s monarchies. Neoconservatism has lost whatever appeal it once had to many voters, so Miller’s vision of conservative internationalism might get a hearing. But to judge from Donald Trump’s victory in the U.S. presidential election, it may be conservative nationalists who now have the upper hand on the political right."
34,This Vast Southern Empire: Slaveholders at the Helm of American Foreign Policy,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2016-12-08/vast-southern-empire-slaveholders-helm-american-foreign-policy,This Vast Southern Empire: Slaveholders at the Helm of American Foreign Policy,"Some years ago, I wrote a book titled Special Providence, which identified the four schools of thought that, in my view, have shaped debates about U.S. foreign policy: the Hamiltonian, the Wilsonian, the Jeffersonian, and the Jacksonian. The book mentioned but did little to describe a fifth major school that vanished after the Civil War: the Davisonian school, named for Jefferson Davis, the Confederate president, and promoted by southern slaveholders who saw the defense of slavery as the most important goal of U.S. foreign policy. Karp has written a comprehensive history of the Davisonians that shows how a pro-slavery foreign policy dominated the executive branch from the presidency of John Tyler (1841–45) through the Buchanan administration, which ended in 1861. Once the United Kingdom abolished slavery in the British Empire in 1833 and set about opposing the slave trade and promoting abolition globally, southern slaveholders sought to protect other outposts of slavery (including Brazil, Cuba, the Republic of Texas, and French colonial possessions in the Caribbean) from British pressure and orient U.S. diplomacy around the needs of the South’s “peculiar institution.” Combining immense erudition with an engaging style, Karp sheds light on an important but poorly understood era in American foreign policy and provides much food for thought about the ways in which the Davisonian legacy continued to influence the United States long after slavery died."

In 2006, the historian Robert Kagan followed McDougall’s lead with an influential book titled Dangerous Nation, which interpreted U.S. foreign policy as oscillating between two schools of thought: an “expansionist” school that included presidents such as Abraham Lincoln, Theodore Roosevelt, and Franklin Roosevelt and that had its roots in classic American thought and a “realist” school that sought to limit the United States’ role in the world and had its origins among southern slaveholders and segregationists. McDougall’s latest book, which deserves and rewards a careful reading, is partly a belated riposte to Kagan’s book. Kagan, McDougall maintains, missed both the expansionism of the slaveholders and the foreign policy restraint of their opponents. The Tragedy of U.S. Foreign Policy argues that an American “civil religion,” an evolving set of ideas, began by conceiving of the U.S. role in the world as setting an example of democratic and Christian values. Over time, McDougall maintains, that civil religion has become more interventionist and progressive. As a result, U.S. foreign policy has become more ambitious and less realistic."
36,What Do We Know About Civil Wars?,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2016-12-08/what-do-we-know-about-civil-wars,What Do We Know About Civil Wars?,"For those who wonder whether all the effort that goes into political science really yields much benefit, Mason and Mitchell provide some reassurance by bringing together leading experts on civil wars for a substantial stock-taking exercise. Because wars within states are so much more common than wars between states, there is a rich amount of material available on their origins, incidence, duration, and effects. One can always doubt whether scholars can actually generate meaningful theories by comparing disparate cases, but this book shows how a combination of methodologies allows analysts to identify and explore a number of important issues, including the role of ethnicity, the importance of state capacity (or lack thereof), and the problems of bringing civil wars to definitive conclusions."

But for those who want to understand the key decisions that determined the outcome of the war, the organization of the opposing armies and their deployments, the role of logistics and intelligence, and the moments of inspired generalship (and missed opportunities), it is hard to imagine a better book than this. The authors reveal how the two sides stumbled into the first war of the modern era and then struggled to come to terms with the conflict’s strategic implications. The Union’s victory was by no means inevitable; leadership was the key, and the authors give high marks to President Abraham Lincoln for recognizing just how long and painful the war would be and how vital it would be to empower the right generals. In the east, Confederate generals displayed their tactical brilliance while hoping for a decisive battle. But the war was won, the authors argue, in the west, where the Union general Ulysses S. Grant made his name."
38,The Evolution of Modern Grand Strategic Thought,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2016-12-08/evolution-modern-grand-strategic-thought,The Evolution of Modern Grand Strategic Thought,"Far from evolving into a clear concept, grand strategy has never been properly pinned down. In a tight, terse piece of analysis, Milevski laments that grand strategy remains “a standardless, incoherent concept, whose popularity surge after the end of the Cold War multiplied the lack of rigour with which it was employed.” He traces the concept’s history, examining the major thinkers who have shaped it, beginning with the nineteenth-century maritime strategists Alfred Thayer Mahan and Julian Corbett and then moving on to the interwar British school of thought led by J. F. C. Fuller and Basil Liddell Hart. He then shifts to prominent figures in U.S. strategic history—including some familiar names usually associated with nuclear strategy but also shining a welcome light on the often overlooked Edward Mead Earle—before concluding with appraisals of contemporary American theorists such as Edward Luttwak and John Lewis Gaddis. This is an accomplished contribution to the literature on the history of strategic theory, precisely because it illuminates how policy debates and changing geopolitical circumstances have altered the meaning of a concept. This seems to bother Milevski, but I am not sure that it should."

This view was built on the trauma of Pearl Harbor and reinforced by the 9/11 attacks, and it is kept alive by a policy community obliged to constantly scour the world for threats. Roberta and Albert Wohlstetter, spouses who made their names at the RAND Corporation during the early years of the Cold War, did more than almost anyone else to foster this grim mindset. Robin demonstrates that this was a team effort, with Roberta’s early literary work on Hamlet providing a model for thinking about the effects of indecision and her later historical work on Pearl Harbor illuminating the dangers of surprise attack. Albert’s main contribution was a series of studies that demonstrated how the developing nuclear balance might be far more delicate than many believed. Although critical of the Wohlstetters’ policy agenda, Robin reveals that they possessed more intellectual depth than their many detractors recognize and traces the ways in which their legacy has been sustained by disciples such as Zalmay Khalilzad, Richard Perle, and Paul Wolfowitz."

Brooks is a law professor who worked as an adviser to a U.S. undersecretary of defense from 2009 to 2011, a position in which she witnessed how technological change and the nature of contemporary warfare have blurred boundaries that once divided war from peace, the military sphere from the civilian one, and armed forces from police departments. This blurring has made it harder to tell when normally criminal acts, such as forceful detention and killing, become lawful and acceptable acts of war. Blurred lines have also drawn the U.S. military, a generously resourced and usually competent arm of the government, into pursuits for which it is not well suited, such as postconflict reconstruction. Brooks is generous toward her former colleagues, portraying their failures as the results of contradictory pressures and imperfect organizations. She writes with knowledge and wit as she tries to identify best practices for a world in which war and peace exist on a complex continuum."
41,The Industries of the Future,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2016-12-08/industries-future,The Industries of the Future,"Many observers marvel at the pace of technological change these days. Some see it as troubling and destructive. Ross puts a positive spin on it: new technologies have disrupted outdated practices and will offer huge potential gains in the future. He divides the major changes likely to emerge in the coming decades into five broad categories: robotics and artificial intelligence; genetic discoveries and gene manipulation; the increasing digitization of economic transactions, which is producing new kinds of businesses and new forms of money; the weaponization of digital code, which will transform adversarial relations among nations; and the continuing growth of “big data.” He regards the United States as a major source of innovation, but one that will soon have to compete with other countries where cultural conditions encourage creative thinking and entrepreneurship. Rapid change in many places might allow for development to skip technological “generations” and those places to catch up quite quickly. A final chapter addresses how the United States should prepare its young people for this brave new world; educators, Ross argues, should focus on improving knowledge of foreign languages and cultures and on inculcating the habits of scientific thinking."

SWFs invest government funds (other than central bank reserves) in stocks, bonds, and other assets, usually but not always abroad. They also involve setting aside some government revenue—often from oil or gas sales—for future use. Such funds were pioneered by Kuwait and Saudi Arabia in the 1950s but only gained prominence with the sharp oil price increases of the 1970s, when oil-producing countries were suddenly flooded with revenues. This informative book explores both the conceptual and the practical aspects of SWFs, providing insights into who owns them (publics or governments), who governs them, who determines the ethics guiding their investments, how they should distribute their earnings, how they might help reduce income inequality, and what unforeseen adverse contingencies should permit governments to draw them down."

Such suits are judged by private arbitration panels whose decisions cannot be appealed. ISDS provisions have existed for many years, but they have rarely been put to use—and when they have been, it has usually been in cases in which a government has destroyed or confiscated a foreigner’s property without adequate compensation. In recent years, however, the number of suits has risen sharply as lawyers have rediscovered the ISDS and expanded its application to the loss of expected future profits. Last year, the energy infrastructure firm TransCanada sued the Obama administration, claiming that the U.S. president had violated North American Free Trade Agreement rules by prohibiting the company from completing the Keystone XL oil pipeline. This slim, timely book discusses the history of the provision and the effects that ISDS litigation—a tactic not available to domestic firms—has had on social and environmental legislation and regulation. The version of the ISDS system that has evolved is not likely to withstand close scrutiny."

Buell, who previously helped investigate and prosecute the Enron case, skillfully explains the conundrums of applying criminal law to corporations and their officers. The standards of proof for a guilty verdict in U.S. criminal law are demanding, and the modern corporation, although a great engine of growth, also represents an ingenious contrivance for avoiding liability and even responsibility. Corporate employees can be criminally prosecuted for harmfully deceiving others but cannot be held legally responsible for bad business judgment. Buell urges a rethinking of the modern corporation, suggesting, among other things, that the United States should federalize the process of incorporation (to prevent states from competing for business by offering lax regulatory regimes) and that the “duty of care” required of corporate management, directors, and shareholders should be extended to other significant stakeholders. Buell focuses on U.S. law and the American economy, but his insights apply to other democracies as well."
46,How Population Change Will Transform Our World,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2016-12-08/how-population-change-will-transform-our-world,How Population Change Will Transform Our World,"In this data-rich but concise book, Harper examines the unprecedented global demographic shifts currently under way and considers what they portend in various parts of the world. Japan and Europe reached “maturity” at the end of the twentieth century, with more people over the age of 60 than under 15. The rest of Asia will reach that milestone in the middle of this century, as will the overall population of the world. By midcentury, Asia will account for 54 percent of the world’s population, down from around 60 percent today, and Europe’s share will decline from around 12 percent to around seven percent. Meanwhile, Africa will remain mostly young as its population more than doubles in the coming decades. Harper is less interested in the ramifications of these shifts for global politics than in identifying the shifts’ sources in particular countries and exploring their social effects. But her work provides a powerful reminder that debates over immigration, social welfare, and inequality will intensify in the decades ahead in a world increasingly divided between older, richer people and younger, poorer ones."

In the nineteenth century, the Industrial Revolution and the development of the railroad, the steamship, and the telegraph allowed modern states to organize and control ever-larger expanses of territory. Territory soon became increasingly tied to geopolitics, as the rise and fall of great powers depended on their grand imperial projects, whose goal was to control large landmasses. The book goes on to trace how the Cold War led to the territorialization of ideology and to examine shifts in the scientific and philosophical conceptions of space. Maier finds today’s world awash in fast-changing and deeply conflicting ideas about territory. The interdependence of economies and the emergence of cyberspace seem to have reduced the salience of physical territorial control and weakened traditional notions of sovereignty and citizenship. But if Maier is correct, territory will continue to claim an important place in the human imagination."

But these coercive threats have often failed; many times, the leaders of weaker states have stood fast. In this fascinating and carefully argued study, Pfundstein Chamberlain puts forward a “costly compellence theory” to explain this pattern of resistance. After examining the Cuban missile crisis, the confrontations that led to U.S. military action against Iraq in 1990 and 2003, and the 2011 conflict with Libya, she argues that the leaders of weaker states do not doubt that the United States will use force when it threatens to; they do, however, doubt its willingness to stay committed to effecting change over the long term, after the bombs have fallen. The United States was successful during the crisis over Cuba precisely because the conditions of the Cold War made its threats more “costly” to execute—and so its threats then were more convincing than they were during the post–Cold War cases. Pfundstein Chamberlain does not miss the irony of this finding: it is precisely the United States’ position as an unchallenged global hegemon that makes its coercive threats less effective."

The American-led system of alliances has become unstable as power has shifted away from the West, transnational dangers have proliferated, and regional orders have crumbled in Europe, the Middle East, and East Asia. And Haass detects an even deeper crisis: the breakdown of the four-centuries-old Westphalian system built around sovereign states. Since the seventeenth century, global order has rested on states, great powers, and the balance of power. But those old building blocks are now giving way as states lose influence and power diffuses to nonstate actors. Looking into the future, Haass sees a world where no one is in control even as nuclear proliferation, migrant flows, collapsing states, and dysfunctional democracies generate a growing spiral of chaos. To ward off disaster, he calls for “World Order 2.0,” a new “operating system” that would update the traditional norms regarding sovereignty and great-power accommodation. Haass wants states to focus not only on their rights as sovereigns but also on their obligations. Doing so, he avers, would produce less interventionism than Wilsonian liberals might wish for but more collective organization than realists would expect. The precise architecture of Haass’ new world order is a bit elusive, but his call for a more pragmatic, inclusive multilateralism represents sensible guidance for the difficult road ahead."

At its narrowest points, the Tumen measures a little over 150 feet wide, and Ahn could easily see the North Korean side from where he stood.

Or would U.S. interests be better served by less American intervention in world affairs—and, in particular, by less exertion of U.S. military force? Theorists and policymakers have argued over those questions for decades, especially since the end of the Cold War. During the past eight years, the Obama administration has changed the terms of the debate by pursuing a strategy of retrenchment. President Barack Obama has sought to reduce U.S. involvement overseas and has moved away from the interventionist strategy of preserving liberal hegemony, arguably shifting closer to something resembling “offshore balancing.” And President-elect Donald Trump could take U.S. foreign policy even further in that direction. That approach was recently advocated in this magazine by the political scientists John Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt, who argued that “instead of policing the world,” Washington should “encourage other countries to take the lead in checking rising powers, intervening itself only when necessary.”"
53,The International Criminal Court on Trial,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/interviews/2016-12-12/international-criminal-court-trial,The International Criminal Court on Trial,"The quest for a permanent global court to try perpetrators of the world’s worst crimes began as early as 1872. But it was only in 2002 that the International Criminal Court, a standing tribunal now backed by 124 states, finally came into being. Ten years later, in 2012, Fatou Bensouda was sworn in as the ICC’s second chief prosecutor. A former deputy prosecutor at the court, Bensouda had also served as minister of justice in her home country of Gambia and worked at the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda. In November, she spoke with Foreign Affairs’ deputy managing editor Stuart Reid in New York."
54,Congress and War,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2016-12-12/congress-and-war,Congress and War,"It is easy to conclude that the U.S. Congress is simply incapable of playing a constructive role in matters of war and peace. Paralyzed by gridlock, the hyperpartisan body regularly betrays its constitutional responsibility to act as a serious check on the executive branch, often preferring instead to launch ideological crusades aimed at scoring political points. Congress has spent thousands of hours on deeply partisan investigations of the murders of four U.S. officials and contractors in Benghazi, Libya, but refrained from making any decision on the military intervention that brought them to that chaotic city in the first place. Although the Obama administration began arming and training rebels in Syria over three years ago, neither chamber of Congress has held a debate over the U.S. policy in the civil war there. And two years after the administration started sending U.S. forces into Iraq and Syria to fight the Islamic State, or ISIS, Congress hasn’t bothered to hold a vote on whether to authorize the use of force for the campaign."
55,Getting Out of the Gulf,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/persian-gulf/2016-12-12/getting-out-gulf,Getting Out of the Gulf,"In January 1980, U.S. President Jimmy Carter used his State of the Union address to announce that in order to protect “the free movement of Middle East oil,” the United States would repel “an attempt by any outside force to gain control of the Persian Gulf.” Carter and his successors made good on that pledge, ramping up U.S. military capabilities in the region and even fighting the Gulf War to prevent Saddam Hussein’s Iraq from dominating the region’s oil supplies. Although Washington has had a number of interests in the Persian Gulf over the years, including preventing nuclear proliferation, fighting terrorism, and spreading democracy, the main rationale for its involvement has always been to keep the oil flowing."
56,Make America Make Again,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2016-12-12/make-america-make-again,Make America Make Again,"Despite their many differences, the major candidates in the 2016 U.S. presidential election managed to agree on at least one thing: manufacturing jobs must return to the United States. Last April, the Democratic contender Hillary Clinton told a crowd in Michigan, “We are builders, and we need to get back to building!” Her opponent in the Democratic primaries, Senator Bernie Sanders, said the manufacturing sector “must be rebuilt to expand the middle class.” And the Republican candidate Donald Trump bemoaned bad trade deals that he said had robbed the country of good jobs. “‘Made in America,’ remember?” he asked a rally in New Hampshire in September. “You’re seeing it less and less; we’re gonna bring it back.”"
57,Advice for Young Muslims,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/world/advice-young-muslims,Advice for Young Muslims,"Saif, the elder of my two sons, was born in December 2000. In the summer of 2001, my wife and I brought him with us on a visit to New York City. I remember carrying him around town in a sling on my chest. A few days after we got back home to Dubai, we watched the terrible events of 9/11 unfold on CNN. As it became clear that the attacks had been carried out by jihadist terrorists, I came to feel a new sense of responsibility toward my son, beyond the already intense demands of parenthood. I wanted to open up areas of thought, language, and imagination in order to show him—and to show myself and all my fellow Muslims—that the world offers so much more than the twisted fantasies of extremists. I’ve tried to do this for the past 15 years. The urgency of the task has seemed only to grow, as the world has become ever more enmeshed in a cycle of jihadist violence and Islamophobia."
58,Europe After Brexit,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/europe/2016-12-12/europe-after-brexit,Europe After Brexit,"The United Kingdom’s vote to leave the European Union has triggered the worst political crisis the EU has ever faced. Since the early 1950s, the EU has steadily expanded, but on June 23, 52 percent of British voters ignored the experts’ warnings of economic misery and opted to leave the bloc. At the annual British Conservative Party conference in October, Prime Minister Theresa May promised to invoke Article 50, which formally begins negotiations and sets a two-year deadline for leaving the EU, by March 2017. Now, given her determination to regain control of immigration and the stiffening resolve of other EU leaders to make an example of the United Kingdom, a so-called hard Brexit—an exit from both the single market and the customs union—is looking increasingly likely. This prospect should lay to rest the once dominant idea that European integration is an irreversible process."
59,How to Build Middle East Peace,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/israel/2016-12-12/how-build-middle-east-peace,How to Build Middle East Peace,"Last May, I resigned from the Israeli government and parliament. I did so largely for reasons of domestic policy, including differences with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on issues such as respect for the rule of law and the independence of the Supreme Court. National policy toward the Palestinians was not central to my resignation, but it is no secret that I differed on that front as well with some in the government and the Knesset in which I served."
60,Are We Safe Yet?,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2016-12-12/are-we-safe-yet,Are We Safe Yet?,"The 2008 financial crisis was the most damaging economic event since the Great Depression, for both the United States and much of the global economy. Although the U.S. economy emerged from it more quickly and in better shape than many other economies did, the crisis imposed tragically high costs and left deep economic and political scars. To help prevent another crisis, Congress passed the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act in 2010. These and other reforms have added a considerable margin of safety to the U.S. financial system."
61,China and the World,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/china/china-and-world,China and the World,"In 2013, China launched an initiative to establish a new multilateral development institution, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. The AIIB, Beijing argued, could help fill a multitrillion-dollar gap in financing for railways, roads, power plants, and other infrastructure in the world’s fastest-growing region. But the United States treated China’s proposal as a challenge to the existing regional and global development institutions that it had helped establish in the decades after World War II. Washington not only refused to join the bank itself but also launched a quiet diplomatic campaign to dissuade its allies from doing so either."
62,The Once and Future Order,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2016-12-12/once-and-future-order,The Once and Future Order,"Few foreign policy issues have attracted more attention in recent years than the problem of sustaining the U.S.-led liberal international order. After World War II, the United States sponsored a set of institutions, rules, and norms designed to avoid repeating the mistakes of the 1930s and promote peace, prosperity, and democracy. The resulting system has served as the bedrock of U.S. national security strategy ever since. In everything from arms control to peacekeeping to trade to human rights, marrying U.S. power and international norms and institutions has achieved sig­nificant results. Washington continues to put maintaining the international order at the center of the United States’ global role."
63,Liberalism in Retreat,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/world/liberalism-retreat,Liberalism in Retreat,"The liberal international order has always depended on the idea of progress. Since 1945, Western policymakers have believed that open markets, democracy, and individual human rights would gradually spread across the entire globe. Today, such hopes seem naive."
64,Will the Liberal Order Survive?,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2016-12-12/will-liberal-order-survive,Will the Liberal Order Survive?,"During the nineteenth century, the United States played a minor role in the global balance of power. The country did not maintain a large standing army, and as late as the 1870s, the U.S. Navy was smaller than the navy of Chile. Americans had no problems using force to acquire land or resources (as Mexico and the Native American nations could attest), but for the most part, both the U.S. government and the American public opposed significant involvement in international affairs outside the Western Hemisphere."
65,World Order 2.0,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2016-12-12/world-order-20,World Order 2.0,"For nearly four centuries, since the Peace of Westphalia, which ended the Thirty Years’ War, the concept of sovereignty—the right of nations to an independent existence and autonomy—has occupied the core of what international order there has been. This made sense, for as every century including the current one has witnessed, a world in which borders are forcibly violated is a world of instability and conflict."

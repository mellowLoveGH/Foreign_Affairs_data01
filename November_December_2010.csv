0,A History of Modern Sudan,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2010-11-01/history-modern-sudan,A History of Modern Sudan,"With the referendum on southern Sudanese independence slated for January 2011, Collins’ concise history of Sudan since the onset of British colonialism offers a useful perspective on contemporary events in the country. Collins emphasizes the permanent estrangement between national elites in Khartoum and those in the marginalized peripheral areas of what is a huge country with very poor infrastructure. Regional inequalities and the absence of economic development outside Khartoum’s immediate vicinity have fueled a succession of regional revolts, the most famous of which have taken place in the south and, more recently, Darfur. Collins is particularly informative when he discusses the origins of the north-south divide, from the precolonial tradition of Arab slave raiding in the south to the incoherence of British colonial policy, which simultaneously encouraged the Christian missions in the south and the propagation of English as the language of administration, even as it allowed the Arabization of the Muslim north. Following independence, the cleavage was exacerbated by the combination of northern cultural imperialism and developmental neglect of the south. Collins also masterfully disentangles the endless petty squabbles of the Khartoum politicians that have resulted in instability and shortsighted policies for most of the country’s postcolonial history. The last chapter offers a succinct overview of the conflict in Darfur."
1,African Soccerscapes: How a Continent Changed the World’s Game,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2010-11-01/african-soccerscapes-how-continent-changed-worlds-game,African Soccerscapes: How a Continent Changed the World’s Game,"The history of soccer in Africa encapsulates many of Africa’s broader sociopolitical dynamics over the course of the last century, and it is surprisingly revealing of the continent’s evolving relationship with the rest of the world during that period. As Alegi narrates in this informative book, soccer was introduced to the region at the dawn of the colonial era by missionaries, soldiers, and colonial administrators. Its rapid growth in popularity was spurred by the region’s modernization, in particular the emergence of urban centers in need of collective enterprises and entertainment. The book argues that soccer played a significant role in the popular struggles of the late colonial period, stoking nationalist pride against the Europeans while also arousing ethnic identity. In the mid-1960s, the continent’s soccer federations played a key role in having apartheid South Africa banned from international soccer competition, in an early example of African diplomatic prowess. Alegi devotes less attention to the contemporary era, although he does describe in some detail how European professional teams recruit young African players all over the continent, a process that too often exploits African teenagers even as it profits various agents and coaches. Here, too, it is tempting to view African soccer as a metaphor for its relationship to the West."
2,Informal Institutions and Citizenship in Rural Africa: Risk and Reciprocity in Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2010-11-01/informal-institutions-and-citizenship-rural-africa-risk-and,Informal Institutions and Citizenship in Rural Africa: Risk and Reciprocity in Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire,"Too much writing about Africa assumes a homogenous culture throughout the continent. One of the great merits of MacLean’s smart and insightful study of Akan villages on both sides of the Ghana–Côte d’Ivoire border is its convincing demonstration that significant differences exist in the practice of such quintessentially “African” cultural phenomena as the reciprocal exchange of gifts and favors between family and friends. She argues that although the two countries share an extremely similar precolonial history, differences between British and French colonialism, and in the countries’ paths since independence, have resulted in the development of very different informal institutions to deal with varying patterns of risk and uncertainty. MacLean makes great use of the wonderfully evocative quotations she derived from detailed surveys conducted in four villages during lengthy stays at each to build a nuanced theory of the interaction between informal cultural institutions and the process of formal state building. Contradicting much received wisdom, she shows that the central state has a powerful effect on rural Africa, even when it is weak and not particularly effective. MacLean’s book deserves a wide audience, both as a model of careful fieldwork and for its precise analysis of social relations in rural West Africa."
3,Why Africa is Poor: And What Africans Can Do About It,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2010-11-01/why-africa-poor-and-what-africans-can-do-about-it,Why Africa is Poor: And What Africans Can Do About It,"Mills' answer to the question posed by the title of his book is that Africa’s political leaders have chosen not to undertake the policies that would bring about economic growth. A South African and longtime observer of Africa, Mills appears to have traveled to just about every imaginable country in the continent and the rest of the developing world to build up an impressive array of examples for his argument that low-income countries can prosper when their leaders implement policies that promote private-sector-led investment. With mordant anecdotes of out-of-the-way factories, failed schemes, and wrongheaded government interventions, he describes African economies as undermined by dreadful infrastructure, low human capital, and in particular counterproductive policies governments use to put up endless obstacles to private investors. The book unabashedly advocates a pro-business point of view to escape the current morass. Some readers will no doubt argue that the search for private profit cannot address the region’s most intractable problems, which probably require public action rather than market solutions. But as a contribution to literature that too often absolves African governments for the region’s mediocre performance, the book’s argument that they are in large part responsible is refreshing. As is the book’s ultimate optimism about the region, since Mills clearly believes these same leaders could choose to make Africa rich."
4,The Trouble with the Congo: Local Violence and the Failure of International Peacebuilding,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2010-11-01/trouble-congo-local-violence-and-failure-international,The Trouble with the Congo: Local Violence and the Failure of International Peacebuilding,"Over a decade old, the United Nations Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo (MONUC) is now the biggest multilateral peacekeeping effort ever, with close to 20,000 troops and civilian personnel and an operating budget over a billion dollars. Cycles of extreme violence in the country have led to some criticism of the UN’s efforts, and Autesserre’s book provides a unique ethnography of the organization in the Congo, the outlook and values of its staff, and its operational logic. The author’s main argument is that the internal culture of the UN and the socialization of its diplomats have blinded the MONUC from properly emphasizing the local causes for the conflict in eastern Congo. Favoring a top-down approach -- the kind for which diplomats are trained -- the international community has focused on national agreements and processes such as elections, ignoring the peace-building efforts that are necessary at the local level to mediate the festering conflicts over identity and land. Autesserre’s arguments are clearly stated and compelling, even if her policy prescriptions, implying a larger and more intrusive international presence in conflict zones, need more detail to be fully convincing."
5,Pearl Buck in China: Journey to The Good Earth,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2010-11-01/pearl-buck-china-journey-good-earth,Pearl Buck in China: Journey to The Good Earth,"A daughter of American missionaries, Pearl Buck shaped the American image of pre-communist China perhaps more profoundly than any other writer, winning a Pulitzer Prize for The Good Earth and a Nobel Prize for that seminal book and other writings. Spurling skillfully interweaves accounts of Buck’s life and work to defend against charges that her picture of China was a racist stereotype. On the contrary, Buck rebelled against the “paranoid self-righteousness” of her father and other missionaries, saw more deeply into the lives of the Chinese poor than most Chinese modernizers of her day, incorporated the structure and diction of Chinese popular fiction into her writing, and was ahead of her time -- often at great personal cost -- in opposing religious fundamentalism, racial prejudice, gender oppression, sexual repression, and discrimination against the disabled. Her best writing grew out of personal suffering, which Spurling brings vividly to life in describing Buck’s childhood, first marriage, encounters with famine and revolution, and mothering of a disabled child. This compassionate biography, which focuses on the first half of Buck’s life, when she lived in China, should move readers to rediscover her work as a source of insight into both revolutionary China and the United States’ interactions with it."
6,Changing Politics in Japan,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2010-11-01/changing-politics-japan,Changing Politics in Japan,"Kabashima and Steel argue that the Japanese political system has become more democratic since the early 1990s. Elected politicians have more influence over policy than they did before, reducing the power of bureaucrats; voters give less patronage-based loyalty to the local Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) candidates and vote increasingly in response to the policies of the prime minister; more voters are party switchers; and the media give voters better information about politics. Driving these changes have been economic stagnation, new electoral rules, reform of the policymaking system at the cabinet level, and increased news programming on TV. The twists and turns of the book’s argument are sometimes hard to follow, as the authors synthesize the work of numerous specialists, opinion and voting surveys, and the research of Kabashima’s seminar at Tokyo University. As the narrative unfolds, the populist ability of former LDP Prime Minister Junichirō Koizumi to run against his own party seems more important than any other factor. If the changes are structural, then politicians like him should continue to emerge, but no new Koizumi seems to be waiting in the wings."

One of them told her, “Everything is over now. Now we can tell the secrets.” The secrets concern the beginnings of the resistance in the region called Kham, an ethnically Tibetan area now in Sichuan; the Kham fighters’ escort of the Dalai Lama to exile in India in 1959; the rebels’ hit-and-run war against the Chinese army; internal rivalries among their leadership, which included the Dalai Lama’s brother Gyalo Thondup; the “flattening” of Kham identity into a broader Tibetan identity; and the failure of the Tibetan government in exile to acknowledge the role of violence in the resistance. CIA support for the guerillas is a known story, to which the old soldiers add some colorful details. Less well known are the roles of the Indian, Nepali, and (to a small degree) Taiwanese governments in supporting the small force. As an anthropologist, McGranahan attends chiefly to the politics of memory and forgetting, the formation of identity, and the construction of gender, leaving the military and political histories of the forgotten war, as she says, a work in progress."
8,"Mao’s Great Famine: The History of China’s Most Devastating Catastrophe, 1958-1962",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2010-11-01/maos-great-famine-history-chinas-most-devastating-catastrophe,"Mao’s Great Famine: The History of China’s Most Devastating Catastrophe, 1958-1962","Scholars already know the high-politics story of how Mao, in his delusion and paranoia, forced his colleagues and the bureaucracy to create the greatest famine in world history by advancing the crazy policies of the Great Leap Forward even after he knew they had failed. Dikötter tells the story with vivid new details from recent memoirs. Then he plunges into even fresher territory, using provincial, county, and city archives to construct the most detailed account yet of the famine on the ground. As the state procured grain and cotton to supply China’s cities, exports, and even foreign aid, local society broke down. People did not just quietly die but were often tortured or persecuted to death. Few methods of cruelty remained to be invented a few years later when the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution broke out. Based on careful archival forensics, Dikötter concludes that the death toll of the Great Leap Forward was at least 45 million, instead of the 30 million previously generally accepted. His relentlessly clinical, morally intense account of filth, disease, and hunger is both fascinating and numbing. Although the command economy that gave Mao the ability to create the famine is gone, the government continues to force the peasants to sacrifice for the welfare of city dwellers."
9,"As China Goes, So Goes the World: How Chinese Consumers Are Transforming Everything; In Search of Paradise: Middle-Class Living in a Chinese Metropolis",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2010-11-01/china-goes-so-goes-world-how-chinese-consumers-are-transforming,"As China Goes, So Goes the World: How Chinese Consumers Are Transforming Everything; In Search of Paradise: Middle-Class Living in a Chinese Metropolis","Gerth writes with a light touch, but he shows deep knowledge of Chinese consumer society. He knows the products and brand names, stores and restaurants, and even the advertisements in women’s public restrooms. China’s golden demographic of 150 million–430 million (depending on where you set the bar for wealth) expresses individuality with credit cards. Everyone wants a car. People ski, golf, drink brandy, travel abroad, and waste huge amounts of food at fancy banquets. An integrated East Asian youth culture has emerged that encompasses music and clothes from Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan, as well as China. In many ways, urban Chinese tastes are becoming like those of Westerners. But Gerth believes the reverse is also beginning to happen. Chinese-designed cars are flooding the lower end of foreign markets. The government has started a program to make China a “branding superpower.” Where all this might lead politically, if anywhere, is not clear. The book is more sharply observed on its first theme -- “as China goes” -- than on its second, how the rising power of the Chinese market will influence the rest of the world."
10,Monsoon: The Indian Ocean and the Future of American Power,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2010-11-01/monsoon-indian-ocean-and-future-american-power,Monsoon: The Indian Ocean and the Future of American Power,"Kaplan takes the reader on a tour around the rim of the Indian Ocean, from Muscat to Malacca, discoursing on history, geography, and strategy. Just as the Indian Ocean, with its two huge bays (the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal) and reliable monsoon winds historically forged economic and cultural links across huge distances, so today the rise of India and China intensifies interactions across a vast region that has been neglected in U.S. strategy. China’s search for energy security has led it to invest in ports and pipelines in Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and Myanmar (also known as Burma), while India seeks influence from Africa to the South China Sea. Pakistan is a mess, and radical Islam is a response to rapid change in many places. But Kaplan’s expectations are surprisingly upbeat. Asian investment may develop Africa, ethnic conflicts in Sri Lanka and Myanmar may soften as democracy takes hold, Indonesian democracy is strong, China and India will compete more with soft than with hard power since territorial expansion is an option for neither, and the U.S. Navy can engineer an “elegant decline” from hegemony by fostering cooperation with other navies to protect the maritime commons. The more China and India rise, the more welcome U.S. power will be in the region as a counterbalance to both."

In this useful and balanced book, two well-known pollsters, one (Rasmussen) associated with the GOP and the other (Schoen) known for his work with Democrats, try to come to grips with the intensity and implications of Americans’ growing disenchantment with their political and intellectual leadership. The book looks at both the left- and the right-wing populism in the United States today. The Tea Party movement may be the latest and most dramatic illustration of voter discontent, but Schoen and Rasmussen remind us of the left-leaning populism that was a driving force in American politics during the waning years of the George W. Bush administration. While the populism of the right is clearly more energetic this political season, the left’s populism is a force that no Democrat can ignore. One of Schoen and Rasmussen’s most useful approaches is to try to measure the gap between what they call “mainstream Americans” and “the political class.” The reader learns, for example, that in April 2009, 19 percent of the political class believed that “tax increases hurt the economy,” while 74 percent of mainstream Americans accepted that idea. Sixty-one percent of the political class believed that the financial bailouts were a good idea; 59 percent of the mainstream thought they were bad.  Rasmussen and Schoen argue that the populist anger is more than a passing phenomenon; they believe that a significant wave of historic political change is taking shape.  Readers who think they are in the political class might do well to pay heed."
12,The Publisher: Henry Luce and His American Century,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2010-11-01/publisher-henry-luce-and-his-american-century,The Publisher: Henry Luce and His American Century,"“Backward ran sentences until reeled the mind,” ran the old New Yorker parody of Time magazine’s brash style. Brinkley’s sentences generally run in the ordinary direction, and his well organized, fluently written biography of the founder of Time and Life magazines comes at an opportune time. With Time’s old archrival Newsweek being sold for less than a six-pack of beer, and with the influence of the “mainstream media” everywhere under attack, this long look at the career of a dynamic American media mogul offers useful insights into the ways the American media landscape adapts to technological and social change. As Luce and his Yale classmate and rival Briton Hadden envisioned it, Time magazine was originally what might now be called a news aggregator, alerting readers to important stories from a wide range of printed sources. Like RealClearPolitics.com, Time sold itself to readers as a convenient way to keep up with a volume of otherwise indigestible and scattered information. Brinkley manages to tell the story of Luce’s (generally sad and frustrated) life while alerting readers to ways in which rapid technological change continually reshaped the business environment in which his magazines had to succeed. This is an outstanding book about an extraordinary man; one hopes it finds the wide readership it deserves."
13,The American Civil War: A Military History,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2010-11-01/american-civil-war-military-history,The American Civil War: A Military History,"This interesting study of the Civil War, well-timed for the sesquicentennial, comes from one of the world’s foremost military historians. A British citizen, Keegan brings both a foreigner’s fresh eye for detail and issues that Americans may overlook and the insight that comes from a lifetime’s study of war. This is not a groundbreaking book of original research, and readers will recognize (and Keegan generously and freely acknowledges) the book’s immense debts to great American historians such as Shelby Foote and James McPherson. It is nevertheless a compelling and illuminating read; Keegan is better than many U.S. historians at capturing the degree to which European ideas and precedents shaped the military ideas of American generals and civilian leaders who were engaged in what was then the most violent conflict since the fall of Napoleon. Young readers will find this an accessible introduction to the military history of the war; scholars and more experienced students will appreciate Keegan’s incisive judgments, clear prose, and keen eye for the telling facts."
14,The Grand Design: Strategy and the U.S. Civil War,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2010-11-01/grand-design-strategy-and-us-civil-war,The Grand Design: Strategy and the U.S. Civil War,"It is increasingly difficult to say anything new about the Civil War, given its treatment at the hands of so many historians with so many different points of view.  Yet Stoker’s book on the changing strategies of the military and civilian leaders in the North and South during the conflict casts a fresh light on what remains the most decisive and harrowing war in U.S. history.  Stoker presents us with a picture of what Abraham Lincoln and Jefferson Davis and their respective generals thought they should be doing, and with the advantage of hindsight, he evaluates the strategic concepts on both sides of the divide.  Not surprisingly, he gives high marks to Lincoln, whose ability to understand both the military and political elements of the conflict contributed greatly to the Union’s ultimate victory. Students of the Confederacy will find it interesting that he criticizes both Davis and General Joseph Johnston. The study of grand strategy is undergoing a much-needed revival at American universities; this clear and incisive book is a useful addition to the syllabus."
15,Last Call: The Rise and Fall of Prohibition,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2010-11-01/last-call-rise-and-fall-prohibition,Last Call: The Rise and Fall of Prohibition,"This well-researched and thoughtful book casts new light on Prohibition, one of the oddest, most important, and least understood American historical developments in the twentieth century.  Often dismissed as an amusing but unimportant episode, the great social experiment of Prohibition was in reality the culmination of one of the most influential social movements in the history of the United States.  Okrent makes a strong case that the movement played a much greater role in progressive politics than is generally thought.  Both the 16th and the 19th Amendments to the Constitution, he argues, were passed principally because it was believed that only an income tax could make up for the revenue dip if governments lost the revenue from excise taxes on alcohol.  And women’s suffrage was needed to ensure the passage of the Prohibition Amendment.  Along the way, this extraordinary book demonstrates the sheer scale of bootlegging. (The problems with today’s drug laws pale by comparison.)  Virtually everyone in the United States seems to have been involved in bootlegging in some way, with the surprising exception of Joseph Kennedy.  Last Call belongs on the shelves of every serious student of the United States in the twentieth century."

Combining polling data and accounts of his experiences with representative Arabs and Americans, he has produced an informative and readable book that avoids the reductionism, demonology, and victimology that all too often taint treatment of this subject. Zogby dismantles a number of American supermyths about Arabs, including that they are all the same and unchanging. Separate chapters deal concisely with perceptions set alongside the reality in Iraq, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, and Palestine. Zogby’s look at Islam through American-Arab perceptions and practice is surely among the most useful ten pages available on this tormented subject. A dominant motif throughout is the need to listen to the “other” and adjust policy to factor in what one hears. The chapter titled “Arab Americans: Bridging the Divide” offers a heartening take on a venerable theme in U.S. history: those who come from another country or culture and become American."
17,The Land of Blood and Honey: The Rise of Modern Israel,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2010-11-01/land-blood-and-honey-rise-modern-israel,The Land of Blood and Honey: The Rise of Modern Israel,"In this book, van Creveld, Israel’s preeminent military historian and theorist, moves beyond his specialization to present a broad-ranging history of modern Israel. The flow of history is well captured in five narrative chapters offering an interesting periodization of the evolving attitudes and actions of Israelis, from the rise of Zionism to the present. Van Creveld provides a Dutch uncle’s rendering of his subject. Sardonic and given to stinging judgments, he does not stint in presenting the flaws of Israeli leaders and the prejudices and paranoia of Israelis. There is not a whiff of hagiography in his treatment of Israel’s leaders or people. The Land of Blood and Honey is not, however, an example of Israeli revisionist history. Van Creveld engages in no hand-wringing concerning Israel’s treatment of the Palestinians, past or present. Indeed, the focus throughout is Israel, its economic developments, Orthodox-secular tensions, the “Americanization” of Israeli culture, and much more. As for Israel and the Palestinians, van Creveld favored the building of Israel’s security fence, deplores the settlements movement, and sees the creation of a Palestinian state along essentially pre-1967 lines not so much as justice for Palestinians but as essential to Israel remaining the Jewish state."
18,Yemen: Dancing on the Head of Snakes,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2010-11-01/yemen-dancing-head-snakes,Yemen: Dancing on the Head of Snakes,"Is Yemen becoming the next Afghanistan? Both countries appear to be fragile states with unpopular leaders confronting open or incipient rebellion (in the case of Yemen, from two very different parts of the country) and showing a shaky resolve about taking on the terrorist threat. In both cases, concerned outsiders are unsure of what to do, although there are no outside military forces intervening in Yemen. Comparisons can be useful in taking the measure of a little-understood country such as Yemen, but even more useful would be a readable history that includes current, on-the-ground snapshot of the country and its people. This Clark achieves, with a political history of Yemen from the sixteenth century to the present, followed by reportage based on her meetings with representative Yemenis, both in the government and in the opposition. Clark leans toward concluding that outsiders should proceed with caution. To evoke another comparison, a half century ago, Egyptian military intervention soon produced the gibe that Yemen was Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser’s Vietnam."

They view Middle Eastern politics and diplomacy as restricted to players from the Middle East and the West. The East Moves West introduces important new actors, especially China and India, but also Pakistan, Japan, and South Korea. Their growing involvement in the Middle East is explained by the normal expansionism of rising powers and their search for energy security. Kemp has compiled a fact-filled handbook that sets out the economic, geographic, and strategic factors involved in these new developments. He measures not just the growing ties of these different Asian states with the Middle East but also their own complex rivalries (such as between India and China and India and Pakistan). Also included is a useful review of the major transnational projects planned or afoot, including pipelines and modernizing land and sea routes. Of the many lessons to be gleaned from this study, two stand out: China and the other Asian states largely stick to commerce and economic development in their Middle Eastern dealings, and the United States would be well advised to scale down its commitment to protecting the Indian Ocean sea lanes by getting the littoral Asian states more involved."

This is more than an ethical or legal treatise. It is a solid historical reconstruction of the sanctions imposed on Iraq from 1990 to 2003 and of the persistent U.S. leadership in this effort. Especially impressive is Gordon’s combing of the sprawling U.S. and UN records over those 13 years. Her findings are somber. For example, she reports, most studies estimate that “at least 500,000 children under age five who died during the sanctions period would not have died under the Iraqi regime prior to sanctions.” She also punctures holes in the argument that the Iraqi suffering was due to the abusive manipulation of the sanctions by the Saddam Hussein regime. She documents a consistent U.S. policy spanning the presidencies of George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush that linked sanctions to regime change, thus eliminating any motivation for Saddam to comply. Moreover, the bureaucracy and the rules governing the sanctions not only gave the United States a virtual veto that not only blocked changes but assured their severely restrictive implementation. In 1995, then UN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali described sanctions as a “blunt instrument.” In the Iraqi case, as Invisible War starkly shows, sanctions can be not just blunt but also ineffective."
21,Stalin's Genocides,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2010-11-01/stalins-genocides,Stalin’s Genocides,"Naimark is not simply about, as the Russian expression goes, ""calling things by their name."" For him, labeling Stalin's mass killing “genocide” entails a rigorous exegesis of the concept itself -- its history, legal complexities, boundaries, and universe. In spare, sharp thrusts, Naimark makes his case, conscious that calling the extermination of ""political, social, and cultural groups,"" as opposed to killing on the basis of race, ethnicity, or religion, is controversial, not the least because the Soviet Union succeeded in removing these categories from the UN Genocide Convention of 1948. The issue is complex, and with great precision, he addresses both the key legal matter of intent and responsibility on Stalin's part and makes a refined comparison of Soviet crimes with those of the Holocaust. The plural “genocides” of the title also matters, because Naimark classifies each of the horrors in the 1930s -- dekulakization during collectivization, the Ukrainian famine of 1932–33, the Great Terror of 1937–38, and the forced deportation of nations during World War II -- as an individual genocide. This is a small book that places a large exclamation point on the most incriminatingly tragic dimension of Soviet history."
22,The Firm: The Inside Story of the Stasi,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2010-11-01/firm-inside-story-stasi,The Firm: The Inside Story of the Stasi,"This is surely the most detailed micro-analysis of the East German security service recently added to the existing flood of material on the subject. To get down into the inner workings of “the Firm,"" as its employees liked to call it, Bruce focused on two of the organization's 217 district offices, Gransee and Perleberg, rather out-of-the-way areas of no particular significance. But, as elsewhere, the Stasi presided over a sprawling network of informants there -- and the archives remained comparatively intact. Bruce combs these and then, in a rare step, actually interviews a number of former Stasi staff, weaving from his conversations telling portraits of 14 of them. This ground-level look does not tell one much about the political activity in Stasi's upper echelons, or even at a lower level in the big cities, but it does convey the stupefying preoccupation with recruiting informants and then harassing the average Stasi agent to get more, often useless, information from them. The image of the Stasi is not so much that of an instrument of terror or even brutal intimidation -- though intimidating it could be -- but of a bureaucratic octopus more fixed on sucking up information than accomplishing a mission, which in the case of unmasking regime opponents in Gransee and Perleberg was something of a fool's errand."

Yet for all the work being done by NGOs and other groups to defend against the abuse of these mothers’ human rights around the world, their offspring comprise a group that has slipped through the cracks. Carpenter, who admits to being emotionally engaged in the subject, wonders why the neglect exists. So rather than simply assemble the data or tell the children’s stories in the case she examines, the Bosnian war, she details how humanitarian advocacy groups set priorities that lead to strategic choices and practical agendas that overlook -- indeed, at times, consciously ignore these half million children. While she loosely associates her study with a constructivist approach from academic international relations theory, Carpenter has written a building-block-level study -- that is, an ambitious exploration of the factors shaping the preferences of the human-rights and child-protection agencies that should be attending to the problem but are not."

Calling his book “an introduction"" to the Caucasus considerably understates how sophisticated and rich it is. The reader would be hard-pressed to find a more graceful, fair-minded, to-the-point, yet compact exploration of this fascinating, tormented, and utterly complex region. See it, he argues, in all of its many crosscutting intricacies and fault lines, not simply as the object of Russian and other great-power games. And start, he insists, with the history of Georgia’s and Armenia's ancient glories, their and Azerbaijan's colonial experiences, and the deep imprint of their recent Soviet past -- a history he offers in clear, compelling form. In its contemporary incarnation, the region struggles under the impact of multiple conflicts -- Georgia against its separatist territories, Armenia and Azerbaijan over Nagorno-Karabakh, Armenia's history-driven tension with Turkey, and the 2008 Russia-Georgia war and its aftermath. Each is a minefield of inflamed emotion, and de Waal carefully picks his way through them with candor and dispassion."
25,Travels in Siberia,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2010-11-01/travels-siberia,Travels in Siberia,"Perhaps it takes a writer as skilled as Frazier to pull off an account like this, with his longanimous, comic eye, gift for the startling apt metaphor, and ability to meld seamlessly life and literature. But to convey the sense and feel of Siberia as he does also requires someone more than a little obsessed with the place, and that Frazier became in the course of visiting or crossing it five times over 16 years -- summer and winter. His defining 2001 trek from St. Petersburg to Vladivostok was a seven-week adventure with two intrepid, infinitely creative Russian guides. They traveled in a fickle Renault van, sans hotels, over impassable or nonexistent roads, took many baths in rivers, stayed at primitive camping spots, and met an indelible list of Siberia’s citizenry. As his obsession grew over the years, Frazier read everything Siberian he could get his hands on, and he uses this considerable knowledge base not only to highlight key historical stages in Siberia's past but also to deepen the color of his own travels with vivid anecdotes about famous others who either came from the region (Vasily Surikov, from Krasnoyarsk; Rudolf Nureyev, the son of Tatars from Irkutsk; Yevgeny Yevtushenko, from Zima Junction) or were exiled there (the Decembrists; the city of Chernyshevsk’s namesake, Nikolai Chernyshevsky; and the many who dragged themselves over the ""road of exiles,"" a path he assiduously traces). Readers will come away with a profoundly renewed respect for a warm, soft bed and other creature comforts, but only after accompanying Frazier vicariously on a truly remarkable set of journeys."

Motivated by moral compassion for the poor, the Ortega Morris describes is effective in delivering tangible goods -- reliable electricity, free primary education, low inflation -- to his base constituents. Battle-hardened and utterly pragmatic, Ortega cuts winning deals with his wife (who, in exchange for a power-sharing arrangement, apparently agreed to overlook his sexual molestations of her daughter), with the Catholic Church (by criminalizing therapeutic abortions), and with right-wing opponents (by releasing them from corruption charges). In his unprincipled wheeling and dealing, Ortega fits very much within traditional Nicaraguan political norms, Morris contends; furthermore, in forging warm relations with Venezuela, Iran, and Russia, Ortega is seeking greater autonomy from a United States that is corrupted by money and has cynically supported unscrupulous Nicaraguan elites. Although Morris was denied direct access to Ortega or his close circle and is sometimes muddled in his judgments, Unfinished Revolution stands as an informative and up-to-date review of the rise to power of Nicaragua’s latest caudillo."

It is more manageable to speak of U.S. relations country by country. So Domínguez and Fernández de Castro (now Mexican President Felipe Calderón’s national security adviser) have understandably served up a collection of separate -- and in each case credible -- essays on Argentina (Roberto Russell), Brazil (Monica Hirst), Chile (Claudia Fuentes Julio and Francisco Rojas Aravena), Colombia (Cynthia Arnson and Arlene Tickner), Peru (Cynthia McClintock and Fabián Vallas), and Venezuela (Carlos Romero and Javier Corrales). Cristina Eguizábal and Anthony Maingot ably handle Central America and the Caribbean, respectively. Dominguez’s overview establishes four themes to provide coherence, with partial success: “balancing” against the United States, the rise of China, the breakdown of ideological consensus, and the securitization of U.S. policies. Notwithstanding its emphasis on the George W. Bush years, the volume marvelously responds to the prayers of college professors searching for concise and accessible accounts of contemporary bilateral policies in our hemisphere."

Having taken a wartime lead, the Americans were initially shocked by the test of the first Soviet atomic device, in August 1949, and then alarmed as it appeared that they were being overtaken by the Soviets in missile technology and production. On the first count, they blamed spies at the heart of the American project; on the second, they looked to American spies to find out about the Soviet projects."

It has been overshadowed by World War II before it and the Vietnam War after it. It was operationally confusing, and its conclusion was unsatisfactory, with the parties back where they started and their differences still not yet resolved. And it was a hybrid, somewhere between a civil and an interstate war. Yet as Millett’s extensive bibliographical essay demonstrates, there is no shortage of material on the course and conduct of the war, and he seems to have read all of it. This large book is the second in a trilogy. The first, subtitled “A House Burning,” put the Koreans in the driver’s seat in the move to war. Now he examines the first year of the conflict, when the major powers entered the fighting, and describes the back and forth as the North Koreans first advanced and then retreated, chased back by UN forces led by the United States, until China, famously catching General Douglas MacArthur by surprise, rescued the North with its own intervention. This is one of those books that invite words such as “magisterial,” “authoritative,” and “definitive.” Millett provides a record of events  in clear and measured prose, with full regard for context and personalities; the interplay between the local and the international as well as the military and diplomatic; and the details of battle and the broad sweep of the campaign."

Suffering children shown on TV understandably evoke universal sympathy, compassion that is converted into both official and private donations of cash or goods. There the troubles begin. Polman, a Dutch journalist, has covered civilian victims in war zones for 15 years, and in The Crisis Caravan, she summarizes the reality of such donations at the receiving end -- in Afghanistan, Bosnia, Congo, Iraq, Kosovo, Somalia, and Sudan. For every dollar given, less than ten cents, she suggests, may actually reach the intended recipients -- and sometimes even that may do more harm than good if it requires effective follow-on treatment, which is often not provided. Warring factions learn to exploit the donors, both for sustenance and as cover for purchases and the delivery of arms. These days, the number of well-meaning donors in a given area can exceed 200, and their uncoordinated activities enormously complicate both the delivery and the effectiveness of the intended assistance. Worsening matters are journalists, often driven by compassionate sentiment themselves, who, Polman contends, too often suspend their critical judgment with respect to what is actually happening. She pleads for donor groups to ask serious questions about the unintended consequences of their actions and to review seriously the ethical dilemmas they pose."

In contrast to much recent pessimism about the future of market-oriented capitalism, he believes that its pragmatic, adaptive characteristics will see it through to a robust future, despite the admittedly formidable challenges the world economy now faces. In the end, Kaletsky predicts, it will dominate the “Beijing model” that now finds admirers around the world. The fourth stage will reject the market fundamentalism that has dominated official, financial, and academic thinking and will acknowledge that a vigorous economic and financial system depends on a symbiotic and pragmatic relationship between government and private agents. Because of fiscal exigencies, Kaletsky argues, government in the future must be smaller in many respects. He faults U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson for turning a financial problem into a true financial crisis and near catastrophe by misunderstanding the nature of the problem and by unnecessarily wiping out the shareholders (including recent foreign investors) of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, thus decisively closing one route out of the predicament. And he is rightly scathing about the role of mark-to-market accounting in such a dynamically unstable period as 2008."

Not these authors. They argue strongly that the Doha Round should be resumed and brought to a successful conclusion. In Figuring Out the Doha Round, they offer new estimates of the gains to international trade and to production that a successful Round could achieve, by country and industry. According to the authors, on the basis of the compromise proposal on the table in 2008, the prospective benefits to the United States are small, but they believe Americans should be interested in the positive effects in developing countries. They go on to argue for a “topping up” of the negotiating agenda -- including sectoral agreements on chemicals, electronics and information technology, and environmental goods -- which, if successful, could enlarge the gains all around by a factor of five. This book is not for numerophobes; it contains many quantitative estimates and much discussion of the methods used to make them."

Rajan, the author of Fault Lines, is a former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund and one of the few who, as early as 2005, foresaw serious weaknesses in financial systems. At the time, his warnings were not well regarded in official or financial circles. He takes a sophisticated and subtle global perspective with a simple but questionable underlying thesis: that in the early years of this century, the United States pursued excessively stimulative monetary and fiscal policies out of concern for persistent high unemployment, thereby creating high demand for imports, leading to large trade deficits. These policies, the argument goes, relieved other countries (mostly notably China, Germany, and Japan, but many smaller countries as well) from pursuing more stimulative policies at home, since jobs could be created domestically by exporting to the United States. Why did political concern with unemployment arise in the United States? Rajan blames the country’s weak social safety net: unemployed Americans get modest unemployment compensation for only six months and often lose their employer-based medical insurance, and they can hardly afford private medical insurance (if they can get it) on their meager unemployment benefits. Thus an important part of the solution to global imbalances, Rajan argues, is improved provisions for low-income Americans."

The project started as a celebration of the 50th anniversary of Eindhoven University of Technology and involved interviews with more than 50 applied scientists and engineers on the evolution of diverse technologies in the coming decades. The technologies they describe are likely to be life-transforming in some respects (regarding personalized health care, for example) and disappointingly slow to arrive in others (regarding alternatives to fossil fuels, for example). The range of topics -- including cryptography, geothermal energy, and influenza -- is breathtaking, and the treatment of each subject is necessarily brief but informative. When discussing technology and finance, the book, started before the financial crisis but completed after it, is (rightly) harsh on the prevailing economists’ doctrinal view of financial markets."
35,Globalization and the National Security State,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2010-11-01/globalization-and-national-security-state,Globalization and the National Security State,"A lively debate exists among scholars over the impact of economic interdependence on conflict and war. Liberals have traced the ways in which rising economic linkages create national interests and political constituencies that favor stable and peaceful relations, whereas realists have noted that statesmen often ignore considerations of economic gain and loss in decisions about war and peace. This study by two Canadian political scientists casts a critical eye on the expansive claims of “globalization theorists” who argue that the decline of great-power war and the rise of nontraditional security challenges -- such as terrorism, drug trafficking, and the environment -- are eroding the traditional national-security orientation of states. Is globalization altering the way security policy is being conducted at the global level? Are states reducing military expenditures, refocusing their attention on new transnational security threats, and ceding authority to nonstate actors and international organizations? Examining global and regional trends in how states have pursued security since the end of the Cold War, Ripsman and Paul find less change than might be expected. The wealth generated by globalization has led some states to increase defense spending, and the security policies of major states are still responsive to realist-style security challenges. At times, Ripsman and Paul are in danger of shooting at a straw man. Although some pundits in the 1990s might have suggested that globalization was leading to the “demise” of the state, most scholars today see more mixed and contingent effects of growing interdependence on how states pursue security. If the world needs more security cooperation, it is states that will need to provide it."

Dallek, who has written authoritative studies of the foreign policies of Franklin Roosevelt, Harry Truman, and Richard Nixon, offers here profiles of Allied and Axis leaders -- Winston Churchill, Adolf Hitler, Roosevelt, Joseph Stalin, and Truman, as well as fellow-traveling generals and diplomats -- as they made fateful decisions about war and peace. As Allied cooperation yielded to Cold War hostilities, grand hopes for world peace produced by the unprecedented violence of world war were largely unrealized. Dallek’s aim is to revisit the “misjudgments and unwise actions that caused so much strife and suffering” and suggest alternatives that might have led to greater “international harmony.” The result is a collection of colorful and insightful portraits of the era’s leading figures and their decisions. Dallek follows the statesmen to Casablanca, Tehran, Yalta, San Francisco, Potsdam, and into the Cold War. Interestingly, the book does not find many moments when history might have unfolded differently. Hitler made a general war in Europe inevitable, and Stalin made conflict with the West unavoidable. Roosevelt was not naive about Soviet ambitions and skillfully turned the United States into a global leader -- yet it is not clear if he would have managed clashing postwar interests and ideologies better than Truman. Dallek does speculate that if Truman and Churchill had been more open about the atomic bomb and offered a commitment to Germany’s permanent demilitarization in exchange for Soviet promises on self-determination in Eastern Europe, the world after 1945 might have been very different. Dallek tells a compelling story, stopping at places to point out the exaggerated fears, rhetorical bombast, and ideological blindness that turned great-power differences into an era when humanity itself was on the brink."
37,Rational Theory of International Relations: The Logic of Competition and Cooperation,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2010-11-01/rational-theory-international-relations-logic-competition-and,Rational Theory of International Relations: The Logic of Competition and Cooperation,"In the three decades since the appearance of Kenneth Waltz’s seminal Theory of International Politics, scholars have been grappling with his sweeping thesis that international anarchy creates a general tendency for states to compete, balance, and forsake cooperation. Various schools of realist theory have emerged -- offensive, defensive, classical -- to explain complexities that Waltz’s general theory misses, such as the failure of states to balance, the absence of great-power war, the peaceful end of the Cold War, and the extraordinary postwar upsurge in institutionalized cooperation among the advanced industrial states. In this important study, Glaser attempts to reassemble the various realist pieces into a new comprehensive theory of conflict and cooperation. He focuses on three sorts of factors shaping security strategies: the motives of a state, its material capabilities, and the information it has about the capacities and intentions of others. Out of these variables, he fashions a rationalist theory that deduces the circumstances under which states will seek to cooperate or compete. The result is a novel synthesis of realist theory that will provide a useful baseline for future research and debates. The critical move Glaser makes is to distinguish between “security-seeking” and “greedy” states. The first type is motivated to overcome suspicions and cooperate, whereas the second is aggressive and willing to risk war. The problem is that this argument begs the question of why a state is one way or the other, the answers to which lie outside of Glaser’s theory. For readers less interested in academic debates, the book will nonetheless be interesting for its clear-eyed portraits of great-power politics, including the shifting power relations between China and the United States."

But while few dispute that countries such as China, India, and Brazil will wield more power in the coming decades, it is less clear what they will do with their power. In this little book, two leading scholars offer a manifesto for U.S. leadership in a post-Western international system. Their major claim is that the era of U.S. ideological dominance is over. The world no longer gravitates to American-style ideas about the virtues of free markets, democracy, and hegemony. Power is diffusing not just to other states but to young people and social groups increasingly connected within an electronic global village. In this new setting, Weber and Jentleson argue, the “competition for ideas” is rapidly growing. To exercise leadership, the United States will need to fashion more appealing ideas about order and justice. The principle of “mutuality,” the authors suggest, might best guide the reform of global institutions in a way that draws all states into a more balanced and shared system of global governance. Acknowledging that no country has a monopoly on good ideas, the book makes a good case that the United States needs to recast the way it talks about its role in the world. But it gives little attention to what non-Americans and non-Westerners actually think about the organization of the global system. The “basic questions of world politics are now open for debate,” Weber and Jentleson contend, but the grand alternative still remains unclear."

It is home to the world's fifth-largest land mass and eighth-largest economy and is one of the top global producers of stuff everyone else needs: from animals, vegetables, and minerals to water, energy, and airplanes. The new conventional wisdom suggests that Brazil is now poised to make its name on the global stage and balance the other power in its neck of the woods, the United States. Brazil's ascent coincides with the relative decline of U.S. influence in Latin America and the rise of new centers of power in Asia. This dynamic reinforces Brazil's central foreign policy message: with both place and purpose for a new global player on the world stage, Brazil can be the Mac to the United States' PC -- with an ethos and an international agenda to match."

Most nations define their interests largely in economic terms and deal mostly in economic power, but less so the United States. Most nations have adjusted their national security strategies to focus on economic security, but less so the United States. Washington still principally thinks of its security in traditional military terms and responds to threats with military means.

Some see its current government as careening toward ""Islamist fascism""; others believe it is integrating into a basically pluralistic, secular, globalized international order. Does its fast-growing economy, the 17th largest in the world, make it a rising international power on a par with Brazil, China, India, and Russia? Or is it a minor player that is overextending itself? Although Turkey has an important secondary role to play in many major areas of U.S. concern, such as stabilizing Afghanistan and Iraq, it is essential to none.

Bush have articulated a similar vision, and with similarly grandiose rhetoric. All have argued that the long-term survival of authoritarian states depends on their ability to control the flow of ideas and information within and across their borders. As advances in communications technology -- cellular telephones, text messaging, the Internet, social networking -- allow an ever-widening circle of people to easily and inexpensively share ideas and aspirations, technology will break down barriers between peoples and nations. In this view, the spread of the ""freedom virus"" makes it harder and costlier for autocrats to isolate their people from the rest of the world and gives ordinary citizens tools to build alternative sources of power.

The dramatic growth of Brazil, China, and India -- and the emergence of middle-tier economies such as Indonesia and Turkey -- is transforming the geopolitical landscape and testing the institutional foundations of the post-World War II liberal order. The Obama administration promotes developing cooperative relations with emerging powers, believing that countries with a stake in world affairs will become responsible global actors. But the United States should be under no illusions about the ease of socializing rising nations. Emerging powers may be clamoring for greater global influence, but they often oppose the political and economic ground rules of the inherited Western liberal order, seek to transform existing multilateral arrangements, and shy away from assuming significant global responsibilities."
54,Books for the World Ahead,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/review-essay/2010-10-21/books-world-ahead,Books for the World Ahead,"The first issue of Foreign Affairs contained seven pages of short reviews of recent books on international relations. From 1925 to 1936, the diplomatic historian William Langer had the, as he put it, ""rather formidable task"" of writing these reviews. (The selection criteria were both flexible and ethnocentric: ""books on all or any aspect of international affairs, in any civilized language."") The section itself, he wrote later, ""was not to be a simple list of titles, which is never of much value, but a more or less critical analysis of each title -- something about the standing of the author, the character of the book, the nature of its sources, the author's viewpoint or conclusion."" The tradition has continued to this day, and now ten distinguished contributors fill some 25 pages each issue."
55,The Rise of the Mezzanine Rulers,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/world/rise-mezzanine-rulers,The Rise of the Mezzanine Rulers,"Governments across the Middle East and South Asia are increasingly losing power to substate actors as those actors insert themselves at a mezzanine level of rule between the government and the people. Local populations often regard such mezzanine rulers as championing ethnic, religious, or political causes; protecting marginalized communities; and providing vital services, but Western governments think they undermine effective governance and encourage state fragmentation. Western governments also tend to see such movements as temporary, destined to wither away."
56,The Digital Disruption,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/world/digital-disruption,The Digital Disruption,"The advent and power of connection technologies—tools that connect people to vast amounts of information and to one another—will make the twenty-first century all about surprises. Governments will be caught off-guard when large numbers of their citizens, armed with virtually nothing but cell phones, take part in mini-rebellions that challenge their authority. For the media, reporting will increasingly become a collaborative enterprise between traditional news organizations and the quickly growing number of citizen journalists. And technology companies will find themselves outsmarted by their competition and surprised by consumers who have little loyalty and no patience."
57,American Profligacy and American Power,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2010-10-16/american-profligacy-and-american-power,American Profligacy and American Power,"The U.S. government is incurring debt at a historically unprecedented and ultimately unsustainable rate. The Congressional Budget Office projects that within ten years, federal debt could reach 90 percent of GDP, and even this estimate is probably too optimistic given the low rates of economic growth that the United States is experiencing and likely to see for years to come. The latest International Monetary Fund (IMF) staff paper comes closer to the mark by projecting that federal debt could equal total GDP as soon as 2015. These levels approximate the relative indebtedness of Greece and Italy today. Leaving aside the period during and immediately after World War II, the United States has not been so indebted since recordkeeping began, in 1792."
58,Back to School,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/united-states/back-school,Back to School,"During his trip to Asia last November, U.S. President Barack Obama sat down to a working lunch with South Korean President Lee Myung-bak in Seoul. In the space of little more than a generation, South Korea has developed one of the world's best-educated work forces and fastest-growing economies -- and President Obama was curious about the South Korean miracle. ""What is the biggest education challenge you have?"" he asked Lee. Without hesitating, Lee replied, ""The biggest challenge I have is that my parents are too demanding."""

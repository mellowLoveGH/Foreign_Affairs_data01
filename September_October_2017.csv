Unless international politics changed in some fundamental way, humanity itself might not survive much longer."
1,Disorder Under Heaven,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/asia/2017-08-15/disorder-under-heaven,Disorder Under Heaven,"I appreciate Bilahari Kausikan’s review of my book The End of the Asian Century (“Asia in the Trump Era,” May/June 2017). He is correct to point out my focus on the economic, political, and security risks that may derail Asia’s future stability. But his misinterpretation of my argument at several points, although not fatal to an understanding the book, gives a misleading impression of some of its more significant claims."
2,Understanding Eritrea: Inside Africa's Most Repressive State,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2017-08-15/understanding-eritrea-inside-africas-most-repressive-state,Understanding Eritrea: Inside Africa’s Most Repressive State,"Since gaining its independence from Ethiopia in 1993 after a long and bitter war, Eritrea has retreated further and further into itself. A secretive, narrow-minded elite helps the president for life, Isaias Afwerki, run the country with an iron grip. Afwerki’s rule combines old-fashioned authoritarian repression (inspired by Maoist doctrines) with unrestrained corruption: the handful of profitable businesses in the country are controlled by regime cronies—with the help of banks in nearby Dubai, according to Plaut. Because the regime has never conducted a real census, keeps no official economic statistics, and refuses to publish a national budget, analysts have been left to merely guess at the extent of the government’s economic malpractice. Plaut has written a well-informed and useful introduction to the country. He argues that the long-standing border dispute with Ethiopia is sustained by Afwerki’s growing paranoia but that the Ethiopians have also helped keep the conflict going for their own purposes, even though international law is pretty clearly on Eritrea’s side."
3,Rogue Empires: Contracts and Conmen in Europe's Scramble for Africa; Decolonization: A Short History,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2017-08-15/rogue-empires-contracts-and-conmen-europes-scramble-africa,Rogue Empires: Contracts and Conmen in Europe’s Scramble for Africa; Decolonization: A Short History,"These two first-rate books respectively examine the beginning and the end of the colonial enterprise in Africa. Press’ book details the events leading up to the Berlin conference of 1884–85, at which the European powers carved up the African continent and divided it among themselves. The book expertly steers through fairly familiar stories of interstate competition and of adventurers such as Henry Morton Stanley, whose peregrinations in the Congo River basin provided the basis for King Leopold II of Belgium’s personal claim to the vast territory. (Press also relates the less familiar tale of how Leopold first sought to establish a fiefdom in Borneo before turning to central Africa.) Press’ originality lies in adding a thorough analysis of the private companies, typically chartered or at least encouraged by European governments, that paved the way for colonization. In many instances, agents working on behalf of private firms made deals with local traditional chiefs and kings in the African interior, which later formed the basis for the legal claims to territory that European states made during the Berlin conference."
4,The African Union: The First Ten Years,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2017-08-15/african-union-first-ten-years,The African Union: The First Ten Years,"The African Union emerged in 2001 as a replacement for the dysfunctional Organization of African Unity. With its 55 members, the AU is the premier intergovernmental organization on the continent. Touray’s balanced survey of its record during its first ten years argues that the AU hasn’t made much more progress than the OAU achieved in realizing the long-standing pan-African aspirations of its architects, who hoped to promote economic integration and improve national governance. Both organizations have failed in part because their member governments have treated them as clubs for heads of state and in part because of a chronic lack of resources. Compared with the OAU, however, the AU has played a much more productive role in international peacekeeping operations, where it has proved useful to both African countries and Western governments. Touray also argues convincingly that the AU has helped change norms in the region on issues such as the legitimacy of military rule."
5,Warlord Democrats in Africa: Ex-Military Leaders and Electoral Politics,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2017-08-15/warlord-democrats-africa-ex-military-leaders-and-electoral,Warlord Democrats in Africa: Ex-Military Leaders and Electoral Politics,"In a number of African countries, civil conflicts have ended with awkward transitions from military rule to civilian leadership. Regular multiparty elections have become the norm in most of these countries, leaving former guerrilla leaders, military officers, and other assorted “big men” with little choice but to put away their guns and begin second careers as politicians, asking citizens for votes. This collection of essays assesses how this phenomenon has shaped African democracy. A probing essay discusses the career of Rwandan President Paul Kagame and makes clear that the strategic skills he developed as a guerrilla commander have helped him entrench himself as a strongman ruler. Other informative chapters profile less well-known figures, such as João Bernardo “Nino” Vieira of Guinea-Bissau, Afonso Dhlakama of Mozambique, and Riek Machar of South Sudan. The book’s main takeaway is that the role of such men in postconflict democracies remains generally negative, in part because once in power, they tend to adopt approaches anchored in their pasts."
6,Viet Nam: A History from Earliest Times to the Present,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2017-08-15/viet-nam-history-earliest-times-present,Viet Nam: A History from Earliest Times to the Present,"This ambitious survey is pathbreaking not only in its chronological scope (from prehistory to the present) and the breadth of its sources but also in its thematic reach. Kiernan explores Vietnam’s ecological diversity, from mountains to lowlands to coastal regions; the country’s environmental changes and their effects on Vietnamese society; Vietnam’s evolving literary genres; and the changing role of its women. He emphasizes Vietnam’s complexity as “a series of homelands” for more than 50 distinct ethnic groups that forged a common identity as Vietnamese only in the last couple of centuries and that even now only partially adhere to that identity. The territory was divided and redivided by successive chiefdoms and kingdoms; invaders came and went. Languages and religions were formed and reformed by migration, trade, and conquest. Although the war against the United States is an important part of Vietnam’s story, it takes its place in the broad sweep of history as just one episode in a long series of struggles that people have waged over this piece of land."
7,North Korea and Nuclear Weapons: Entering the New Era of Deterrence,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2017-08-15/north-korea-and-nuclear-weapons-entering-new-era-deterrence,North Korea and Nuclear Weapons: Entering the New Era of Deterrence,"Although the United States insists that North Korea must give up its nuclear weapons, most analysts agree that won’t happen. Nor is the regime in Pyongyang likely to solve the problem by collapsing. A military attack to end North Korea’s nuclear program is close to unthinkable because of the huge cost it would impose on South Korea, which would face immediate retaliation from the North. What remains as the most likely scenario, this book’s contributors argue, is nuclear deterrence. Although deterrence theory is highly developed, few have discussed how it may apply to this case. The contributors warn that deterrence between Washington and Pyongyang may be less stable than it was between Washington and Moscow during the Cold War. North Korea would likely take advantage of the standoff to proliferate nuclear technology and to increase its nonnuclear provocations, and the lack of communication between the two sides would generate a higher risk of escalation than existed during the Cold War. Because a nuclear strike on North Korea would damage China, fear of Beijing’s response would make U.S. resolve less credible. Japan and South Korea might not trust the United States to protect them to the same degree that Washington’s European allies did, and they could go nuclear themselves. Deterrence may be the least worst option for dealing with a nuclear-armed North Korea, but it would be no panacea."
8,Japan's Security Renaissance: New Policies and Politics for the Twenty-first Century,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2017-08-15/japans-security-renaissance-new-policies-and-politics-twenty,Japan’s Security Renaissance: New Policies and Politics for the Twenty-first Century,"Over the past decade, intensifying Chinese and North Korean threats to Japan have accelerated a long-brewing shift in what Oros calls Japan’s “security identity,” from a country that can never use force to one that must play a larger role in defending itself. Although a national consensus remains elusive, the center of public discourse on this subject has moved to the right, even if not all the way to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s preferred stance of revising the “peace constitution.” So-called conservative realists have taken over the mainstream in the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, new parties have emerged to the ldp’s right, the main opposition parties on the left have become more pragmatic about security issues, and the military has gained greater influence. Signs of the resulting “security renaissance” include Japan’s acquisition of sophisticated new ships and antimissile systems, the re­deployment of Japanese forces to defend the disputed Diaoyu/Senkaku Islands, strengthened military cooperation with the United States, an embrace of a larger role in collective defense beyond East Asia (including in the Middle East), and outreach to regional neighbors such as Australia, India, and Vietnam. Japan is not reverting to militarism, but it has become a more formidable security actor."
9,When Crime Pays: Money and Muscle in Indian Politics,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2017-08-15/when-crime-pays-money-and-muscle-indian-politics,When Crime Pays: Money and Muscle in Indian Politics,"India is one of many democracies, past and present, where voters do not “throw the bums out” but instead pack their state and national legislatures with people who have been charged with (if not always convicted of) serious, sometimes violent crimes. The money such reprobates can muster helps them gain office, but Vaishnav argues that the two real enablers are ethnic rivalries and weak institutions. When courts and administrative agencies don’t work, voters in ethnic or religious communities may rationally prefer representatives who can protect their interests by whatever means necessary, which allows criminal-minded musclemen to shift from merely supporting candidates to running for office themselves. Vaishnav makes a convincing case by telling tales from the campaign trail, analyzing the conditions that breed crime and corruption, and probing survey data that reveal that voters who are particularly focused on their ethnic identities are more willing than others to vote for candidates charged with crimes. His study reinforces the growing consensus that healthy democracies require strong institutions not only of accountability (such as elections) but also of governance, and he concludes with a robust set of recommendations for how to clean up Indian politics."
10,Cyber Dragon: Inside China’s Information Warfare and Cyber Operations,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2017-08-15/cyber-dragon-inside-chinas-information-warfare-and-cyber,Cyber Dragon: Inside China’s Information Warfare and Cyber Operations,"As the Internet and social media have surged in Chinese civilian life since the 1990s, communications technology has also taken an important place in Chinese war planning. The Chinese term for cyber-enabled warfare is “war under conditions of informatization.” Cheng expertly interprets the wealth of data available in Chinese-language open sources on what this means in practice, including not only the use of technology to gather battlefield intelligence, coordinate joint operations by different military arms, and assist in targeting but also its use to influence public attitudes in target countries, conduct espionage, and gain access to adversaries’ military and civilian cyber-infrastructures. The boundary is also blurring between external warfare and internal control. As technology advances, information warfare becomes as all-encompassing as information itself."
11,Incarnations: A History of India in Fifty Lives,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2017-08-15/incarnations-history-india-fifty-lives,Incarnations: A History of India in Fifty Lives,"With 50 biographical sketches, Khilnani builds a mosaic of India’s history since the time of the Buddha, paying less attention to the distant past and more to the last couple of centuries. Some of the subjects, such Mohandas Gandhi and the poet Rabindranath Tagore, are familiar, whereas many others—seers, rulers, slaves, poets, artists, yogis, engineers, and entrepreneurs—will be new to most non-Indian readers. As the stories accumulate, they bring into focus the diversity as well as the interconnectedness of Indian society, the strictness of social hierarchies along with the power of individuality, the intensity of religious commitment and the clash of different faiths, the gradual construction of a sense of nationhood and the long struggle for independence. In almost every sketch, Khilnani shows how the past has been remade to serve present-day agendas. The book reads like the BBC radio series from which it was adapted: punchy, personal, and quick moving, creating an incentive to learn more."
12,A New Literary History of Modern China,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2017-08-15/new-literary-history-modern-china,A New Literary History of Modern China,"One hundred and forty-three authors contributed 161 short chapters to this monumental survey of modern Chinese literature in all its forms, from the late eighteenth century to the present. Yet the book reads like the work of a single versatile author: vivid, probing, and occasionally playful. It raises to a new level the knowledge available in English about this vast topic, presenting a literary culture more complex, cosmopolitan, and profound than even many specialists might realize. The book presents a wealth of detail about personalities and events throughout the Chinese-speaking world and connects them to cultural forms ranging from poetry, fiction, and opera to pop songs, cartoons, photographs, and film. It challenges much of the received wisdom about how literary history should be written, refutes the cliché that Chinese literature in the modern and contemporary periods has been derivative and mediocre, and opens up inspiring prospects for future scholarship."
13,Fractured Lands: How the Arab World Came Apart,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2017-08-15/fractured-lands-how-arab-world-came-apart,Fractured Lands: How the Arab World Came Apart,"Anderson believes that beginning with the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003— and despite the brief promise offered by the popular revolts of 2010–11—the Arab world started a steady descent into wars over identity, as defined by religion, sect, ethnicity, and tribe. Anderson, a veteran journalist, uses portraits of three Arab men, two Arab women, and a Kurdish man to illustrate this process in personalized terms. He doesn’t quite pull it off, but the stories are compelling and well told, depicting jarring life choices in the face of horrifying circumstances. The resurgent “primordialism” that Anderson identifies is captured by an Iraqi Kurd he meets who wants to raze homes in his village so that their former occupants can never try to reclaim them. Sentiments such as that one have led some observers to conclude that only polities built on primordialism can survive in the region. Anderson doesn’t take a position on that question. One problem with Anderson’s overall argument is that by using the invasion of Iraq as a kickoff, it neglects the 50-year Sudanese civil war, the Lebanese civil war, the Iran-Iraq War, and three Arab-Israeli wars, all of which were steeped in the same kind of primordialism that Anderson laments in today’s Middle East."
14,Arab Fall: How the Muslim Brotherhood Won and Lost Egypt in 891 Days,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2017-08-15/arab-fall-how-muslim-brotherhood-won-and-lost-egypt-891-days,Arab Fall: How the Muslim Brotherhood Won and Lost Egypt in 891 Days,"Trager’s book is based on extensive interviews with senior and midlevel leaders of Egypt’s Muslim Brotherhood, which in 2012 captured the country’s presidency and a parliamentary plurality in Egypt’s first free elections in decades. Trager chronicles the 891 days that followed at a level of detail that only Egyptoholics like me might appreciate. Trager asks a very big question and delivers an unequivocal answer: Are the Brotherhood and its offshoots the face of moderate Islam, capable of sharing power in a democratic, pluralistic system, or is the group a totalitarian entity that tolerates no internal debate about its mission of bringing Islamic government to Egypt and the world? Trager believes the totalitarian face is real, and the moderation mainly a mask. For that reason, he argues, the efforts of the Obama administration to engage with the presidency of Mohamed Morsi, a former Brotherhood leader, were misguided and ultimately unproductive, although Trager notes that there were no good alternatives. But if Trager is right, and if political Islam is here to stay, the Egyptian story has bleak implications for the future of the Muslim world."

So argues Cook, a seasoned analyst of the Middle East, in this highly readable, sometimes chatty, and ultimately very pessimistic book. All four of the countries he examines—Egypt, Libya, Tunisia, and Turkey—have fallen victim to unresolved identity crises and “sticky institutions” that refuse to reform. Even in Tunisia, often held up as the sole success story of the mostly failed Arab revolts of 2010–11, progress has been precarious. The factors that fueled those movements and the large protests that erupted in Istanbul in 2013 will persist for at least a generation. The United States, Cook argues, had little to do with the uprisings and could not have done much to affect their outcomes; it is hubris to think otherwise. But Cook suggests, somewhat forlornly, that Washington can still play the long game, using foreign aid to foster social change that may alter political realities far down the road."
16,"The Islamic Enlightenment: The Struggle Between Faith and Reason, 1798 to Modern Times",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2017-08-15/islamic-enlightenment-struggle-between-faith-and-reason-1798,"The Islamic Enlightenment: The Struggle Between Faith and Reason, 1798 to Modern Times","De Bellaigue is an erudite journalist and historian who takes on a vast subject: the Middle East’s incomplete coming to terms with the Enlightenment. His book tells a sweeping story of how the three great centers of Middle Eastern society and religion—Cairo, Istanbul, and Tehran—have ridden a roller coaster in dealing with the West, and he peppers his tale with marvelous portraits of leaders, thinkers, and activists. De Bellaigue blurs the plot a bit by using terms such as “Enlightenment,” “modernity,” and “liberal values” interchangeably. But he makes a strong case that, contrary to the conventional wisdom, the Middle East has not suffered from intellectual torpor but in fact often creatively incorporated and developed many ideas that originated in the West. He also describes, however, a reactionary “counter-Enlightenment” that is now more powerful than ever and whose origins he locates in the 1928 founding of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt. De Bellaigue posits that the intellectual history of the region has been too often told by “triumphalist” Western historians and “renegade” Muslims who have turned on their religion. But his references suggest otherwise, and his own arguments echo those of advocates of “defensive modernization,” who in the 1950s and 1960s argued that the main problem facing the Middle East was how to absorb the military and engineering prowess imported from an aggressive West."
17,Salafi-Jihadism: The History of an Idea,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2017-08-15/salafi-jihadism-history-idea,Salafi-Jihadism: The History of an Idea,"In the recent flood of accounts of radical Islam, this one stands out. Maher’s compelling exploration of Salafi jihadism achieves a level of clarity that perhaps could be produced only by someone who, like Maher, once adhered to that strain of thought. The book is exceptional also in its focus on theology: although Maher is a specialist in jihadist radicalization, he dwells little on jihadists’ motivations, paying much more attention to their beliefs. Salafi jihadism rests on five doctrinal building blocks that together create a coherent and consistent ideology: jihad (holy war), tawhid (the oneness of God), hakimiyya (true Islamic government), al-wala wal-bara (loyalty to divine truth and disavowal of untruth and polytheism), and takfir (the naming of disbelievers). (There are some partially irreconcilable tenets, however, when it comes to the killing of innocents.) This extremist creed reflects core Islamic beliefs. But the contemporary appeal and spread of Salafi jihadism have been most profoundly shaped by the civil war in Algeria in the 1990s, the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq, and the ongoing turmoil in Afghanistan. The unending conflict in Syria will lead to the further refinement and growth of this form of radicalism, and not to its demise."
18,Russia: The Story of War,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2017-08-15/russia-story-war,Russia: The Story of War,"It is common for histories of Russia to stress how much the state and society have been subordinated over the centuries to the military enterprise. Carleton does not contradict that judgment but turns it around, arguing that war is central to Russia’s historical identity: indeed, since the thirteenth century, Russia’s capital, Moscow, has been a battlefield in every century except one (the eighteenth). Deeply etched into the Russian mind is the aggrieved sense that the country’s fate has been to be civilization’s savior—aggrieved because others, rather than appreciating Russia’s noble role, have usually viewed the country as aggressive and barbarous. Carleton explores elements of Russian self-image as they appear not only in official narratives but also in literature and film: the endurance and bravery of the solitary soldier, a people rising to defend the Motherland, the ever-present threat of war and the unspeakable toll it takes. To understand Russia in the Putin era, Carleton argues in this spare, original book, one must recognize the mental and emotional outlook that near-constant war has produced."
19,Moscow 1956: The Silenced Spring,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2017-08-15/moscow-1956-silenced-spring,Moscow 1956: The Silenced Spring,"Nineteen fifty-six was an important year in Russian history, not because a war or a revolution began that year but because that is when Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev gave a speech to a Communist Party congress in which he unmasked the monstrous crimes and mistakes of his predecessor, Joseph Stalin. The content of the “secret speech,” the motivations behind it, and in broad terms the waves it created are all familiar. But until this book, the intricate and fraught ways that the confession played out in the Soviet Union were not. Smith proceeds month by month, choosing a theme for each: for March, the disorientation of the party faithful and their awkward effort to explain how Stalin’s abuses could have happened; for April, the impeded process of rehabilitating Stalin’s victims; for May, the struggle of prison camp victims to regain normal lives. The thoroughness with which she introduces her characters lends the account a riveting immediacy. De-Stalinization unleashed forces that the regime could not bear, and which it had crushed by the end of 1956. But the changes that started that year forever marked a generation, one that would continue to chip away at the Soviet system and that would ultimately bring it down."
20,Everyday Law in Russia,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2017-08-15/everyday-law-russia,Everyday Law in Russia,"Law in Russia has long been viewed by outsiders as a tool used arbitrarily by those who rule—an image strengthened in the Putin era. Hendley, one of the most seasoned students of Russian law, would not deny that any country where the law is twisted to serve the political and venal interests of those with power does not live under the rule of law. However, she estimates that in Russia, only three percent of all instances of law enforcement involve such perversions. She does not question the damage done to democracy by such abuses, but she is more interested in the ways in which most citizens typically engage with the law: divorce proceedings, personal-injury suits, common misdemeanors, and so on. After two decades of close study, a good deal of it conducted in courtrooms, she paints an authoritative picture of how the law works for ordinary Russians and what they think of it. Russians normally try to resolve their problems out of court. But when they do seek legal recourse—and they increasingly do—they do so without misgivings. Hendley provides a fine example of how Russian reality is often much more complicated than those on the outside believe."
21,Gorbachev: His Life and Times,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2017-08-15/gorbachev-his-life-and-times,Gorbachev: His Life and Times,"In this combination of deeply penetrating history and engrossing psychological study, Taubman draws on a wide range of sources and interviews (including seven with his main subject) to render every major development of the former Soviet leader’s six-year tenure with depth and completeness. The biography spans Mikhail Gorbachev’s entire life, up to the present day, which finds him despairing over the direction that Russia has taken under President Vladimir Putin. The book grants the reader behind-the-scenes access to Politburo meetings, Gorbachev’s private conversations with aides, and his give-and-takes with foreign leaders. “His strengths made everything possible,” Taubman concludes, “but his weaknesses undermined his whole project.” The first half of this sweeping judgment refers to the nobility of Gorbachev’s hopes, his stalwart idealism, his moderation and aversion to the use of force, and his forbearance (except when it came to Boris Yeltsin, whom Gorbachev came to loathe). But in leading his country out of the Soviet era, Gorbachev was ultimately hobbled by his determination to plunge ahead without a clear sense of what came next and by the stubborn misapprehension that he could reconcile political forces that were irreconcilable."

Turning Points of the Russian Revolution","The centenary of the 1917 Russian Revolution has brought forth a number of excellent new histories, including these three, which differ from one another in striking ways but all feature superb insight into one of the last century’s turning points. Smith’s book is the most comprehensive of the three. Indeed, in many respects, it is the most expansive history of the 1917 revolution available. Smith traces the revolution in detail, as well as its prelude and aftermath. Every step of the way, he draws in the many different elements of the period—not just the political tumult but also the changing character of Russian society, economic developments, cultural trends, and the impact of a turbulent international context. Throughout, Smith fairly and intelligently arbitrates the great debates among historians over how to interpret the revolution. Were readers to look for one book to read on the subject, this should be it."
23,The Fate of the Furious,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2017-08-15/fate-furious,The Fate of the Furious,"The 15-minute opening sequence of The Fate of the Furious, the eighth installment of the blockbuster Fast and Furious film franchise, paints an alluring portrait of Havana: the city’s bright sunlight, color-drenched architecture, exuberant youth, and ethos of innovation and openhearted generosity. The hero of the series, Dom (played by Vin Diesel), best sums up the defining premise of the Havana segment when he explains what led him to choose to honeymoon in Cuba: “The same things that bring everyone to Cuba: culture, people, beauty.” In the sequence’s dramatic climax, Dom wins a hard-fought drag race against a tough local competitor, by a nose. The loser is gracious: “You won my car, and you earned my respect.” Dom’s response is equally magnanimous: “Keep your car: your respect is good enough for me.” In that instant, the film astutely captures the essence of relations between the United States and Cuba: a striving for mutual respect. After enjoying the biggest worldwide opening-weekend box-office revenues of all time, the film—the first major Hollywood production to be shot in Cuba since the revolution in 1959—grossed over $1 billion globally in the two months following its release. Cuba’s tourism bureau could never dream of affording such powerful advertising. Despite U.S. President Donald Trump’s harsh anticommunist rhetoric, the new administration’s Cuba policies appear unlikely to stem travelers’ interest in visiting the irresistible island."
24,The FBI in Latin America: The Ecuador Files,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2017-08-15/fbi-latin-america-ecuador-files,The FBI in Latin America: The Ecuador Files,"Before the creation of the CIA, in 1947, U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt turned to J. Edgar Hoover’s FBI to gather intelligence in Latin America. During World War II, some 700 FBI agents worked the region—45 in Ecuador alone. Mining previously overlooked FBI archives, Becker, an expert on Ecuadorian history, finds that the FBI reports from that period contain valuable primary-source information on Ecuadorian politics. Since political activists tended not to be very good archivists of their own activities, the FBI agents ironically became the region’s historians—and not bad ones at that, Becker recognizes, especially as the agents gained experience in the field. Roosevelt was concerned about Nazi infiltration of Ecuador, but Becker finds that Hoover’s agents focused more on local leftists. Nevertheless, Becker gives the FBI agents points for not exaggerating external influences, appreciating the weaknesses of the Ecuadorian Communist Party, and acknowledging the role of poverty and inequality in fostering political dissent. Becker also notes that the available archival record does not reveal any FBI attempts to actively infiltrate or disrupt the activities of leftist political parties in the country."
25,Argentina’s Economic Reforms of the 1990s in Contemporary and Historical Perspective,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2017-08-15/argentinas-economic-reforms-1990s-contemporary-and-historical,Argentina’s Economic Reforms of the 1990s in Contemporary and Historical Perspective,"From the early 1980s through the early years of this century, Domingo Cavallo served in a series of top economic policy posts in the Argentine government. Making use of his insider perspective, Cavallo and his co-author—his daughter, also an economist—seek to explain the extreme volatility of the Argentine economy. They divide Argentine economic history into two long eras: the Golden Age (1870–1914), when governments pursued a market-driven open economy and spent productively, but with restraint, on education and infrastructure; and 1945–90, a period marked by irresponsible populism, distortive state interventions, fiscal deficits, and runaway inflation. During the 1990s, Cavallo struggled mightily to dismantle the populist legacy, but ultimately, the authors lament, “politics crushed policies, and corporatism and special interests prevailed.” Why did the Argentines fail to learn the right lessons from their repeated calamities? Reasonably, the Cavallos blame unresolved divisions among stubborn political factions, distributive tensions (debtors versus creditors, workers versus capitalists, rural inhabitants versus city dwellers), impossibly complex and unstable rules, and weak institutions (including a corrupt and politicized judiciary)—in short, a devastating shortage of civic culture. This is a compelling book, although its omissions suggest another problem: few Argentines are willing to accept some blame for their national tragedies."
26,Puerto Rico: What Everyone Needs to Know,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2017-08-15/puerto-rico-what-everyone-needs-know,Puerto Rico: What Everyone Needs to Know,"Duany, a Puerto Rican intellectual now based at Florida International University, was an inspired choice to write a primer on an island that an important 1901 U.S. Supreme Court ruling described as “belonging to the United States, but not a part of the United States.” Duany reviews Puerto Rico’s political history, its economic booms and busts, and, most brilliantly, its bountiful cultural production. He argues persuasively that, although it lacks full sovereignty, Puerto Rico meets most of the criteria for being considered a nation-state, including a shared territory, language, and history. A national identity has survived through the Spanish language and through distinctly Puerto Rican art and culture, despite the imposition of U.S. commercial capitalism. But the island’s economy is performing poorly, a result of fiscal mismanagement, relatively high labor costs, and the loss of federal tax subsidies. Meanwhile, the population has declined because of massive emigration. In 2016, the U.S. Congress enacted the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act to deal with the island’s severe debt crisis. Although it promised financial relief, the legislation was a blow to the island’s sovereignty."
27,Better Neighbors: Toward a Renewal of Economic Integration in Latin America,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2017-08-15/better-neighbors-toward-renewal-economic-integration-latin,Better Neighbors: Toward a Renewal of Economic Integration in Latin America,"If the Trump administration adopts the economic protectionism that the U.S. president threatened to pursue during his 2016 campaign, the countries of Latin America could respond with “open regionalism”—bringing their economies closer together while deepening their integration into other inviting global markets. Although crafted prior to the U.S. election, the message of this volume by World Bank economists is even more pertinent today. It offers a warning to those who imagine that Latin America has no alternative to U.S. markets and so can be readily bullied into unilateral trade concessions. The authors recognize that advocates of open regionalism—hardly a new concept—have failed to raise intra-regional exports beyond 20 percent of total exports. But a cold shoulder from the Trump administration might act as a catalyst. The authors recommend further trade liberalization, especially between Mexico and countries in Central and South America, and argue that the region’s governments should harmonize their countries’ rules and regulations, expand their investments in regional infrastructure and logistics, and, most controversial, remove barriers to the migration of workers across national borders."
28,The Holocaust: A New History,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2017-08-15/holocaust-new-history,The Holocaust: A New History,"The Holocaust has become an iconic event in modern history, known to almost everyone across the globe. It is also one of the most widely studied: an interested reader can now choose among a dozen good general histories and tens of thousands of specialized volumes. Rees has compiled a readable, moving, and comprehensive overview of this scholarship, enlivened by vivid first-person reminiscences. He highlights three critical points of historiographic consensus. First, the mass killing was not inevitable. Although Adolf Hitler was a vicious anti-Semite, the extermination of the Jews was not his initial conception of the Final Solution. Nor did the mass murder result from a single, clear decision. Rather, it evolved out of incremental bureaucratic escalation and adaptation during wartime and was pursued unevenly. Second, the Jews were neither the only group nor even the first one that the Nazis targeted for industrial extermination. They pioneered concentration camps"
29,"Faster, Higher, Farther: The Volkswagen Scandal",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2017-08-15/faster-higher-farther-volkswagen-scandal,"Faster, Higher, Farther: The Volkswagen Scandal","In 2015, a scandal rocked Volkswagen, the world’s largest automobile company, when investigators found that it had equipped its diesel-engine cars with computer code that allowed them to evade antipollution regulations. Nitrous oxide is responsible for asthma, heart attacks, and other health risks, and Volkswagen’s “defeat devices” hid emission levels that were up to 20 times as high as the legal limits. In the end, the fraud cost the company over $10 billion in fines and restitution. This book by a reporter who covered the story has the vices and virtues of a journalistic account. It is repetitive, peddles cheap stereotypes of Germans and business executives, and struggles to develop a bottom line: indeed, readers never learn exactly who in the company knew about the fraud. Yet the book is nonetheless quite readable—and worth reading for its insights into global corporations and efforts by governments to regulate them. Readers learn how assiduously the German government protects its big businesses from national and EU regulations, how easily large organizations can be directed to harmful and illegal purposes, and how essential academic scholars and independent government regulators are to the protection of the public interest."

Some believe resistance is futile. Yet Buchsbaum describes the French government’s surprisingly successful defense of French cultural identity in the face of winner-take-all globalization. His book traces in precise but engaging detail France’s preservation of its cinema industry. By the early 1990s, U.S. films controlled 60 percent of the French market, and that proportion was rising steadily. Since then, the French state has systematically deployed its power to reverse that trend. At the center of this effort has been a program of domestic state subsidies to filmmakers, theaters, and television stations, all linked to maintaining quotas for French-produced content. Stiff opposition from Hollywood followed, as did a concerted U.S. effort to get the World Trade Organization to ban such subsidies and liberalize trade in films. French diplomats and regulators went on the offensive, forming alliances with other countries, notably Canada, and successfully pushed for the establishment of an international legal right to cultural sovereignty. EU regulations and Europe’s ability to negotiate lent France clout. For those who prize global cultural diversity, this is a hopeful tale."
31,Hitler's American Model: The United States and the Making of Nazi Race Law,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2017-08-15/hitlers-american-model-united-states-and-making-nazi-race-law,Hitler’s American Model: The United States and the Making of Nazi Race Law,"Historians of the twentieth century often represent the New Deal–era United States and Nazi Germany as polar opposites. This unsettling book demolishes that orthodoxy. It carefully documents how the tradition of racist laws in the United States inspired and instructed Adolf Hitler and Nazi lawmakers in fashioning their own racist policies. Many forget that as late as the 1930s, the United States remained one of the world’s most salient models of legally institutionalized racism. Nazi lawyers closely studied Jim Crow laws imposing segregation, denying equal citizenship, banning nonwhite immigration, and criminalizing miscegenation. Hitler himself praised the United States for its record on race relations, not least for its westward expansion through the conquest and extermination of Native Americans. Whitman is admirably careful not to exaggerate the influence of the U.S. model on Nazi Germany: he recognizes that twentieth-century American southern racism was decentralized rather than fascist and incapable of inspiring mass murder on the industrial scale of the Holocaust. Indeed, Nazi jurists criticized their American counterparts for their hypocrisy in publicly denying yet locally practicing systematic racism. Whitman reminds readers of the subtle ironies of modern history and of the need to be constantly vigilant against racism."

Cohen observes that the invention of opera coincided with the emergence of the modern nation-state, and the art form’s subsequent evolution has mirrored changes in state power. Many of the greatest operas raise profound questions of political philosophy. Claudio Monteverdi’s operas portray the ruthless political intrigue that the composer saw around him in small Italian courts. Operas by Jean-Baptiste Lully and Jean-Philippe Rameau explore how absolutist monarchs, such as the Bourbon kings for whom the two composers wrote, can wield their power for moral ends. Mozart’s three great Da Ponte operas trace subtle shifts in eighteenth-century society and question whether a social hierarchy headed by aristocratic men is truly consistent with Enlightenment values. This subtly insightful book helps readers experience these timeless masterpieces anew."

Mocked and scorned by liberals as an inarticulate bumbler during his presidency, Eisenhower has had his strategic gifts, strong values, and prudent statesmanship come into clearer relief with the passage of time. One of the deep stains on his reputation, and a key reason why so many liberals disliked him so strongly in the 1950s, was the perception that he avoided confrontations with Senator Joseph McCarthy, the flamboyantly demagogic anticommunist. In Ike and McCarthy, Nichols argues persuasively that Eisenhower was in fact deeply engaged in the fight against McCarthy and even orchestrated a series of attacks, culminating in the famous Army-McCarthy hearings of 1954, that ultimately destroyed McCarthy and his movement. The story draws attention to Ike’s darker side: deliberate perjury by government witnesses was part of the strategy that brought McCarthy down. Love of covert operations was a central feature of Eisenhower’s “hidden hand” approach to foreign policy. In suggesting that the same tendencies helped defeat McCarthy, Nichols reminds readers that Eisenhower’s legacy is more complex and shadowy than some of his more earnest defenders care to admit."

It is a gripping read about a dispiriting team. One of the interesting phenomena of recent American elections has been the increasing mismatch between the quality of the reportage and the quality of the candidates; rarely in the long annals of political history have so many good books been produced about such mediocre figures. Anyone with an interest in the U.S. political process will want to consult this book, but in the end, it is hard to believe that the root causes of Clinton’s failure lay with the team she assembled. Future historians seeking to understand her defeat will learn less from tales about squabbling among her aides than from the story of the troubled American polity outside the bubble they inhabited."

The concrete demands of the movement for safer and less violent law enforcement are important, he argues, but the movement flows from a deeper source: the quest of African Americans to live rich lives in a society that all too frequently devalues black humanity and blocks black achievement. In his view, the political push for black rights has always been the external aspect of a movement whose center is the inner, spiritual struggle of black Americans to assert and protect their dignity in a harsh environment. A vital element of the struggle, Lebron argues, involves maintaining the capacity to love white people even in the midst of injustice—a position that evokes Martin Luther King, Jr., and the Christian roots of the African American political tradition. For Lebron, to lose that capacity would mean a diminished self; in his view, the Black Lives Matter movement derives its deepest meaning from simultaneously struggling against injustice and fighting the corrosive effects of that injustice on its victims."
36,The Financial Diaries: How American Families Cope in a World of Uncertainty,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2017-08-15/financial-diaries-how-american-families-cope-world-uncertainty,The Financial Diaries: How American Families Cope in a World of Uncertainty,"Morduch and Schneider carried out a fascinating research project: they and a team of associates worked with more than 250 U.S. households over a year collecting detailed information about how much they earned, how much they spent, and why they made the decisions they did. What the authors found was that income for lower- and lower-middle-income households often varies from month to month, and those variations are responsible for much of the emotional stress and economic difficulty such families experience. For retail workers whose hours and schedules change, or waiters whose tips go up and down depending on the season, or sporadically employed people who endure gaps between temporary jobs, the erratic nature of their income compounds the problems of poverty. The book’s portrayal of its subjects often seems too earnest and one-dimensional: the poor are always sincere strivers; big corporations are invariably greedy. If there were any alcoholics or drug addicts among the families who blew their money on substance abuse, the authors don’t tell readers. The book recycles and repeats its core ideas more than needed. Nevertheless, its main point is important and holds up well: policies aimed at alleviating poverty need to look harder at increasingly erratic income streams."

He also makes a spirited, if not totally convincing, defense of his own discipline of political science and takes some well-aimed swipes at the pretensions of economists. Few in the United States are better placed to describe this world: Drezner is a tenured professor at a major university (Tufts), a widely admired columnist for The Washington Post, and a former think tanker. Drezner believes that despite its problems, the world of American intellectual debate is in reasonably good shape. Vigorous competition among intellectuals for attention and influence, Drezner argues, ensures that new ideas get a hearing and that well-established ones can be toppled. Although every component of the marketplace of ideas faces both financial and intellectual challenges, it continues to grow, and both elite and popular audiences continue to engage in the argument over the United States’ place in the world."
38,At the Edge of the World: The Heroic Century of the French Foreign Legion,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2017-08-15/edge-world-heroic-century-french-foreign-legion,At the Edge of the World: The Heroic Century of the French Foreign Legion,"The French Foreign Legion was established in 1831 at a time of disorder in France. At first it was composed of only foreigners (French citizens were able to join after 1881), and a recruit had to offer only a name and a healthy body to join. The legionnaires’ loyalty was largely to one another, but France fashioned the recruits into an effective force available for tough situations, especially in the French colonies. A mythology developed around the legion, promoted in books and movies in which the legionnaire appeared as a brooding but brave outcast, wearing a trademark kepi and accepting the hazards of war to escape a murky past. Blanchard’s scholarly but entertaining book shows that the mystery and romance associated with the legion had some basis in reality. Blanchard uses the career of Marshal Louis-Hubert Lyautey, who was involved in campaigns with the legion from Algeria to Indochina to Madagascar, to explore the legion’s character, role, and fights."
39,The Causes of War and the Spread of Peace,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2017-08-15/causes-war-and-spread-peace,The Causes of War and the Spread of Peace,"Gat addresses two of the biggest questions in international relations: Why do wars still occur? And is the world becoming more peaceful? His answer to the second question is close to the one offered by the cognitive scientist Steven Pinker, whose optimistic thesis holds that violence has declined over the course of human history and will continue to do so. Gat, however, does not promise that the trend will continue—a wise move, in light of recent events. After opening chapters on prehistoric war, which Gat describes as vicious and ubiquitous, his book goes on to argue for the importance of modernization in dampening violent urges, which it does by making peace seem so much more attractive. With the rise of U.S. power, the modernization process took a distinctly liberal turn and served as the basis for optimistic post–Cold War visions of a peaceful future. That optimism has been dented. Gat is less than confident that benign trends will continue, noting the challenge posed by more authoritarian forms of modernization, exemplified by China, and the risks to peace from societies that have turned against modernization altogether, especially in the Middle East."

Both Weston and Malkasian saw this phenomenon firsthand as civilians working closely with the U.S. military in Afghanistan and Iraq. Weston details his experiences with U.S. marines and Iraqis in Fallujah, trying to make the city function, and then reflects on a similar stint in the Afghan city of Khost, close to the Pakistani border. He attempts to come to terms with the human impact of the wars, visiting the graves of 31 marines whose helicopter was brought down in a mission for which Weston feels responsible. This is a book of bitter and mournful reflections, of lives lost, and of failures to think through the consequences of individual actions. The “mirror test” in the title refers to the moment at which a wounded veteran is allowed to look at his or her “new self.” Weston’s aim is to force the United States to take a hard look in the mirror after the “heedless, needless” wars of the post-9/11 era."
41,A Farewell to Ice: A Report From the Arctic,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2017-08-15/farewell-ice-report-arctic,A Farewell to Ice: A Report From the Arctic,"The surprisingly rapid melting of the icecap of the Arctic Ocean has been widely reported. In this book, Wadhams, an oceanographer, describes in simple terms the basic physics of what has been happening and why and puts forward a brief history of the role of ice on earth. He goes on to conjecture about some of the consequences of the almost certain continuation of Arctic melting, including both some economic advantages (such as increased ocean navigability) and some disastrous outcomes: the release of methane hydrates trapped under Arctic ice, which would aggravate climate change, and the relative cooling of Europe that might result from a southward shift of the Gulf Stream. Wadhams also discusses Antarctica, where, in contrast to the Arctic, the sea ice seems to be growing. The book would have benefited from more material on the land-based ice in Greenland, which is distinct from the sea ice around Greenland and which influences sea levels."

The book doubles as a kind of intellectual history of the global financial system and the innovations that have shaped it. Lo argues that modern economics mistakenly draws inspiration from the static quality of the laws of physics—think of the artificial Homo economicus of economics textbooks, with his unchanging preferences from which he maximizes utility—rather than from the field of biology, which explores the adaptability of systems to changing physical, technological, and social environments. The book abounds with interesting anecdotes drawn from many fields, including the author’s own experiences. (Readers learn, for example, that in an experimental setting, students who have studied banking are more likely to cheat at a game than those who have not.) Lo concludes with some concrete suggestions for how to better align the incentives of market actors and regulators with the goal of a sustainable, resilient, and efficient financial system."

It took decades, but the rest of the world’s rich countries eventually followed suit and instituted similar laws. More recently, many countries began to establish a legal basis for recovering illegally acquired assets in their jurisdictions and returning them to the countries from which they were stolen, usually placing conditions on their use. This informative book documents the sparse success of such recovery schemes, with special emphasis on the United States, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and Australia, listed roughly in order of how much they’ve accomplished. Sharman also discusses several celebrated attempts to get back money stolen by some of the world’s biggest kleptocrats, including Ferdinand Marcos of the Philippines, Sani Abacha of Nigeria, Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, and Muammar al-Qaddafi of Libya. In the author’s view, the overall track record of recovery has been poor, partly because of weaknesses in the laws. However, the more pernicious problem, he notes, is lax enforcement of the rules that govern the gatekeepers who make it possible for kleptocrats to squirrel away illegally acquired assets: banks, of course, but also lawyers, brokers, and real estate firms."

He sets out to debunk a number of common misconceptions about government borrowing, especially the idea that unless a government pays off its debts, it is fiscally unsound or is somehow cheating future generations. He draws on extensive scholarly research about debt, much of it carried out by IMF staff, and presents his findings in comprehensible, nontechnical language. The book reports on how high public debt (relative to GDP) must be, and under what circumstances, before it becomes a drag on economic growth. Cottarelli also includes an informative discussion of the various ways to reduce the burden of public debt, along with their often painful side effects, focusing on Greece and his native Italy. This is essential reading for all those concerned about current high levels of public debt—and for those who are not concerned but should be."

Liquefied natural gas (LNG) can be shipped to any country with a terminal capable of receiving it. As Grigas’ book ably explains, fracking has had economic and environmental effects that will become more profound over time. So, too, will the geopolitical consequences, as the increasing supply of LNG puts pressure on Qatar, Russia, and other gas exporters and makes it less costly for countries such as China and India to reduce their dependence on coal to meet their growing needs for electricity. A truly global market in LNG is emerging and rearranging an energy economy built on long-term bilateral contracts. In particular, lng will reduce the heavy dependence of many European countries on Russia’s monopolistic Gazprom for gas supplies."

In this smart book, Wright argues that the world is slowly inching back to its normal state of great-power competition and zero-sum conflict. What many observers saw as a post–Cold War global victory of liberalism and multilateral cooperation was, in Wright’s realist interpretation, just the temporary dominance of the United States and its ideas. China and Russia were never on a path toward liberal democracy; they were simply waiting until they were strong enough to push back against the West. Wright contends that the triumphalist liberal narrative omits the fact that for large parts of the non-Western world, ethnic and nationalist traditions have been strengthened and not weakened by the forces of globalization. In the coming era of geopolitical competition, he warns, multilateral cooperation will recede and the United States will lose its grip on global institutions. Curiously, despite this bleak prognosis, Wright argues against a U.S. grand strategy of offshore balancing or of managing regional spheres of influence. He argues instead for a strategy of “responsible competition,” in which Washington would seek to preserve the international liberal order and would step up its diplomacy, alliance maintenance, and deep engagement with the world"

In this landmark study, Gunitsky goes further and illuminates the deep connections between global shifts in power and waves of domestic regime change. His book reveals how a series of geopolitical disruptions in the twentieth century created “hegemonic shocks” that triggered movements across the globe toward or away from democracy. In the aftermath of the two world wars and after the end of the Cold War, the United States and western European states became hegemonic powers and catalyzed independence movements and democratic transitions. The rise of German power in the 1930s spurred shifts toward fascism elsewhere, and the emergence of Soviet power in the 1940s led to a raft of communist insurgencies and Soviet-backed regimes. No book has made a stronger case that the fate of democracy is tied to the rise and fall of great powers and the leadership of liberal hegemonic states."

This impressive book provides the best intellectual history yet of that tumultuous era. Some theorists, such as Raymond Aron, David Mitrany, and E. H. Carr, reimagined the role of the state. Others, such as Owen Lattimore and Nicholas Spykman, contemplated the effects of geography and regionalism. Clarence Streit pondered the possibilities of a union of democracies, Friedrich Hayek and Lionel Robbins debated the limits of welfare capitalism and economic federalism, and H. G. Wells and Michael Polanyi explored the transformative roles of science and technology. Rosenboim argues that what united these disparate thinkers was their shared conviction that the scale and scope of world politics were rapidly changing and that new ideas about political authority and cooperation were needed."

Thinkers of all the major schools of international relations theory have used the term. Realists employ it in describing the long sequence of order-building projects that the European great powers pursued in their bids for mastery. Marxists use it to characterize the way leading capitalist societies project their power. For liberals, “hegemony” often refers to the distinctively open and rule-based international orders established by the United Kingdom in the nineteenth century and the United States in the twentieth. Across these intellectual traditions, the impulse is similar: to describe a kind of preeminence that differs from empire by resting as much on consent and influence as on force and outright domination. Anderson, however, dismisses the arguments of theorists (including this reviewer) who have emphasized the “liberal hegemonic” features of the Western postwar order as mere window-dressing for American empire. But he offers his views about world order only indirectly, from the relative safety afforded by explaining other people’s ideas without clearly articulating his own."

The stories that the former U.S. secretary of state tells all advance a central message: the desire for political rights and self-rule is deeply rooted in the human condition. But the book’s focus is political struggle and the contingent character of democratic movements: history, Rice makes clear, does not end. She weaves her own biography into the book, reflecting on her experiences as an African American woman in institutions dominated by white men and as a diplomat with a front-row seat to post-Soviet political transitions in eastern Europe and to Russia’s failed experiment with democratization. She also details fights for democratic change in the Middle East and in Colombia, Kenya, Poland, and Ukraine. Elections are not enough, she demonstrates: aspiring democracies need bedrock political institutions that create opportunities for people to exercise power. Authoritarian regimes are gaining ground today, but Rice is not convinced they are as strong as they look. Democratic breakthroughs are difficult to pull off, she concedes, but the human yearning for freedom is impossible to extinguish."

The assailants have driven trucks and vans into crowds, detonated suicide bombs, carried out mass shootings, and used knives and axes to attack, even behead, their victims. By and large, the attackers have been locals, but they have often received ideological support and practical instructions from members of the Islamic State (also known as ISIS)."

Renewables were first promoted in the 1960s and 1970s as a way for people to get closer to nature and for countries to achieve energy independence. Only recently have people come to see adopting them as crucial to preventing global warming. And only in the last ten years has the proliferation of solar and wind farms persuaded much of the public that such a transition is possible. In December 2014, 78 percent of respondents to a large global survey by Ipsos agreed with the statement “In the future, renewable energy sources will be able to fully replace fossil fuels.”"

The crowds roared; he won. “Our political system is corrupt!” the Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders thundered at his own rallies. His approval rating now stands at around 60 percent, dwarfing that of any other national-level elected official. Although many aspects of U.S. politics may be confusing, Americans are clearly more agitated about corruption than they have been in nearly a century, in ways that much of the political mainstream does not quite grasp. The topic has never been central to either major party’s platform, and top officials tend to conflate what is legal with what is uncorrupt, speaking a completely different language from that of their constituents."
55,True Believers,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/review-essay/2017-08-15/true-believers,True Believers,"In the last two decades, the story of global jihadism has had more plot reversals than a daytime soap. Moribund groups have sputtered to life, former brothers-in-arms have declared one another apostates, and erstwhile hunters of jihadists have joined their ranks. These twists have bewildered governments and analysts, and anyone who claims to have recognized them and their importance as they were happening is probably lying."
56,Global Health Gets a Checkup,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/interviews/2017-08-15/global-health-gets-checkup,Global Health Gets a Checkup,"The World Health Organization was established in 1948 as a specialized agency of the United Nations charged with improving global public health, coordinating the international response to epidemics, and the like. In the ensuing decades, its dedicated staff has served on the frontlines of public health battles, from the eradication of smallpox to the fight against AIDs to the challenges of noncommunicable diseases. In May, the WHO’s member countries elected Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus as its new director general. A malaria researcher, Tedros, as he is known, served as the health minister of Ethiopia from 2005 to 2012 and as foreign minister from 2012 to 2016. He spoke with Foreign Affairs’ deputy managing editor Stuart Reid in New York in July."
57,What America Owes Its Veterans,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/united-states/what-america-owes-its-veterans,What America Owes Its Veterans,"Each year, the U.S. military recruits some 175,000 young Americans. At the heart of its pitch is a sacred promise to take care of those who serve—what President Abraham Lincoln described in his second inaugural address as the national duty “to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his orphan.” Today, this promise is enshrined in the ethics of each service: members of the U.S. Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, and Coast Guard pledge to never leave a fallen comrade behind. After their service, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) works to fulfill this same promise on behalf of a grateful nation, enabled by a budget larger than those of the State Department, the Department of Homeland Security, and the entire U.S. intelligence community combined."
58,"Pay Up, Europe",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/europe/2017-08-15/pay-europe,"Pay Up, Europe","Donald Trump, the 45th president of the United States, has a point about Europe and NATO. In May, in a speech at the alliance’s headquarters, in Brussels, he told his fellow leaders that “NATO members must finally contribute their fair share.” In July, he repeated the warning in Warsaw. “Europe must do more,” he said."
59,The Congressional Apprentice,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/united-states/congressional-apprentice,The Congressional Apprentice,"Within 100 days of his inauguration as U.S. president, Donald Trump had concluded that the U.S. legislative process is “a very tough system.” He is hardly the first occupant of the Oval Office to arrive at that judgment. Every new president finds interaction with Congress more difficult than expected. But what is challenging for any president was bound to be even more so for Trump—especially given the political climate in the United States today."
60,Making Government Smarter,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/bangladesh/2017-08-15/making-government-smarter,Making Government Smarter,"These days, people for the most part believe that governments should try to promote the general welfare of the populations they serve. The disagreements come over how to do that—what goals to focus on, what policies to adopt, and so on. These questions are usually approached through broad intellectual frameworks, such as political ideology or religion, and much time is spent debating the finer points of various doctrines. Often overlooked, however, is a simple and easy way to make lives better: use routine cost-benefit analysis to compare the expected returns from alternative policies and then choose the more effective ones."
61,China vs. America,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2017-08-15/china-vs-america,China vs. America,"As Americans awaken to a rising China that now rivals the United States in every arena, many seek comfort in the conviction that as China grows richer and stronger, it will follow in the footsteps of Germany, Japan, and other countries that have undergone profound transformations and emerged as advanced liberal democracies. In this view, the magic cocktail of globalization, market-based consumerism, and integration into the rule-based international order will eventually lead China to become democratic at home and to develop into what former U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Robert Zoellick once described as “a responsible stakeholder” abroad."
62,The False Prophecy of Hyperconnection,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/world/false-prophecy-hyperconnection,The False Prophecy of Hyperconnection,"It is a truth universally acknowledged that the world is connected as never before. Once upon a time, it was believed that there were six degrees of separation between each individual and any other person on the planet (including Kevin Bacon). For Facebook users today, the average degree of separation is 3.57. But perhaps that is not entirely a good thing. As Evan Williams, one of the founders of Twitter, told The New York Times in May 2017, “I thought once everybody could speak freely and exchange information and ideas, the world is automatically going to be a better place. I was wrong about that.”"
63,Saving “America First”,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/united-states/saving-america-first,Saving “America First”,"One of the privileges of power that Americans routinely abuse is to remember selectively. It was not surprising, then, that this year’s centennial of the United States’ entry into World War I attracted barely any official attention. A House resolution commending “the brave members of the United States Armed Forces for their efforts in ‘making the world safe for democracy’” never made it out of committee. And although the Senate did endorse a fatuous decree “expressing gratitude and appreciation” for the declaration of war passed back in April 1917, the White House ignored the anniversary altogether. As far as Washington is concerned, that conflict retains little or no political salience."
64,Trump and the “Deep State”,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/united-states/trump-and-deep-state,Trump and the “Deep State”,"One of the strangest aspects of the current era is that the president of the United States seems to have little interest in running the country’s government. A political novice with no fixed ideology or policy agenda, Donald Trump took office as if orchestrating a hostile corporate takeover. In his first six-plus months as president, he has followed his own counsel, displaying open contempt for much of the federal work force he now leads, slashing budgets, rescinding regulatory rules, and refusing to follow standard operating procedures. This has cost him allies in the executive branch, helped spur creative (and increasingly effective) bureaucratic opposition, and, thanks to that opposition, triggered multiple investigations that threaten to sap party and congressional support."
65,The Mexican Standoff,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2017-08-15/mexican-standoff,The Mexican Standoff,"For most of the twentieth century, Mexico and the United States were distant neighbors. Obliviousness and neglect from the north was met with resentment and, at times, outright hostility from the south, leaving the two countries diplomatically detached. Yet as the twenty-first century approached, this wariness began to fade, replaced by cooperation and even something resembling friendship. The détente began in the early 1990s, when Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari and U.S. President George H. W. Bush developed a shared economic vision, culminating in the signing of the North American Free Trade Agreement, the largest free-trade agreement in the world and the first to include countries with mature economies (the United States and Canada) and a country with a still emerging economy (Mexico). Bush’s successor, Bill Clinton, embraced the rapprochement, shepherding NAFTA through Congress and later rescuing Mexico from a financial crisis. And although Clinton’s successor, George W. Bush, failed in his attempt at comprehensive immigration reform, he succeeded in working with his Mexican counterparts, Vicente Fox and Felipe Calderón, to transform the U.S.-Mexican security relationship for the better. President Barack Obama reaffirmed and expanded bilateral cooperation by deepening the two countries’ economic integration and supporting Mexico’s efforts to establish the rule of law and improve the security of its citizens."
66,Trudeau’s Trump Bump,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/canada/2017-08-15/trudeaus-trump-bump,Trudeau’s Trump Bump,"After his election, it became clear that U.S. President Donald Trump preferred to greet other political figures with an odd and aggressive gesture: in an apparent show of dominance, he would initiate a handshake, tighten his grip, and then abruptly yank the other party toward him. He did this to Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, then Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch, and even Vice President Mike Pence. So when Justin Trudeau visited the White House on February 13, the Canadian prime minister came prepared. Trudeau, an amateur boxer who once worked as a nightclub bouncer, braced himself, preemptively clenched Trump’s shoulder, and remained immovable as the president shook his hand. Canadians pored over slow-motion video clips of the maneuver as if it were the winning goal in the Stanley Cup final."
67,Down and Out Down Under,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/united-states/down-and-out-down-under,Down and Out Down Under,"In late January, just days after taking office, U.S. President Donald Trump sat down in the Oval Office for his first official call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull. Seated around the Resolute Desk with Trump were Michael Flynn, then Trump’s national security adviser; Steve Bannon, Trump’s chief strategist; and Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary. It should not have been a difficult or fractious exchange: it was an introductory conversation with the leader of the United States’ most reliable ally, the only country to fight beside the United States in every major conflict of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries."
68,Trump’s Gift to Japan,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/asia/2017-08-15/trumps-gift-japan,Trump’s Gift to Japan,"Japan has more reason to worry than any other country in the world about who becomes the president of the United States. In contrast to U.S. allies and partners in Europe, which are surrounded mostly by friendly states, Japan faces many neighbors that are undemocratic and increasingly hostile. Since January, North Korea has launched missiles in Japan’s vicinity 11 times, culminating in a test of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) on July 4. China has continued its buildup of islands in the South China Sea. And in the face of such developments, Japan remains heavily dependent on the United States for its own security."
69,The United Kingdom’s Trump Trap,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-kingdom/2017-08-15/united-kingdoms-trump-trap,The United Kingdom’s Trump Trap,"One sunny afternoon in Covent Garden this past summer, a street performer realized that an audience volunteer sounded American. “Please tell me you’re not a Trump supporter!” the busker pleaded. “Er, no, I’m not,” stammered the embarrassed young man—at which point, the London crowd cheered."
70,Berlin’s Balancing Act,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/germany/2017-08-15/berlins-balancing-act,Berlin’s Balancing Act,"In January, a disturbing report made the rounds in Berlin’s corridors of power. Written by Hans-Peter Bartels, the German parliament’s commissioner for defense oversight, the 95-page document laid out the abysmal state of the German military. Soldiers, the report said, lacked guns, ammunition, and night-vision goggles. Some new recruits were being forced to wait 45 weeks to get their uniforms. Only one-third of Germany’s 123 Typhoon fighter jets were fully deployable, as were just five of its 60 Sikorsky CH-53 transport helicopters. Military training sometimes featured “laughable improvisations,” the document said; earlier reports had described battle exercises during which soldiers used broomsticks to stand in for gun barrels and passenger vans instead of armored personnel carriers. The report was damning but not surprising: for years, the German government has starved the Bundeswehr of funds, leaving it with only 170,000 soldiers, few of them with combat experience, down from over 500,000 in 1990."
71,France’s Gamble,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/western-europe/2017-08-15/frances-gamble,France’s Gamble,"Despite the upbeat characterization of France as the United States’ oldest ally—from the Marquis de Lafayette’s help in the American Revolution to France’s gift of the Statue of Liberty and up through the shared fight in two world wars—the U.S.-French relationship has always been complicated. During the Cold War, French President Charles de Gaulle sided with the United States when it mattered, as during the 1962 Cuban missile crisis. But he also clashed with U.S. leaders as he sought to assert French autonomy within NATO and position his country outside the U.S.-Soviet rivalry. In the 1980s, U.S. President Ronald Reagan’s free-market policies made many French cringe (they tended to overlook his successful efforts to win the Cold War). But his French counterpart, François Mitterrand, also stood up to the Soviet Union, memorably declaring in 1983, “The pacifists are in the West, but the missiles are in the East.” After U.S. President George W. Bush ordered the invasion of Iraq, the United States’ popularity in France hit rock bottom. Things got so bad that a 2003 poll found that 33 percent of French hoped that the United States would lose to Saddam Hussein. It didn’t help that Americans had started calling the French “cheese-eating surrender monkeys” and sporting “First Iraq, then France” bumper stickers on their cars. Yet U.S.-French relations survived the disagreement over Iraq, with French President Jacques Chirac successfully seeking Bush’s support for a joint effort to get Syrian troops to withdraw from Lebanon in 2005."

0,Searching for a Strategy,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/issue-packages/2019-04-16/searching-strategy,What’s Inside,This package has the feel of an intervention—a group attempt to deliver a sobering message to someone in real trouble who refuses to admit it.
1,War and Peacekeeping,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/world/2019-04-16/war-and-peacekeeping,War and Peacekeeping,"As the leader of a group whose goal is to educate U.S. policymakers and the public about the many ways UN peacekeeping missions serve U.S. interests, I read Séverine Autesserre’s critique of the UN’s approach closely (“The Crisis of Peacekeeping,” January/February 2019). I have a far more optimistic view of the UN’s record."
2,A World Safe for Capital,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/review-essay/2019-04-16/world-safe-capital,A World Safe for Capital,"The historian Quinn Slobodian has written a book that is likely to upset enthusiasts of the “liberal world order.” In Globalists, he tells the story of how a small set of intellectuals in central Europe laid the foundations of institutions such as the European Union and the World Trade Organization (WTO), commonly held up today as bulwarks of liberal democracy. Slobodian reveals that these thinkers, who called themselves “neoliberals,” sought to do more than counter fascism and communism, as the conventional wisdom holds. They also wanted to suppress the power of democratic publics. Ordinary people, organized as citizens and workers, posed a grave threat to the neoliberals’ supreme goal: a global economy integrated by the flow of capital."
3,Ctrl-Alt-Delete: How Politics and the Media Crashed Our Democracy,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2019-04-16/ctrl-alt-delete-how-politics-and-media-crashed-our-democracy,Ctrl-Alt-Delete: How Politics and the Media Crashed Our Democracy,"Baldwin has worked as a Washington-based political reporter, a top London newspaper editor, and the communications director for the British Labour Party. In this book, he traces the politicization of print and TV journalism, the rise of Web-based scandalmongers, the ever more sophisticated big-data techniques that election campaigns use, and the recent exploitation of all the new technologies involved to undermine democracy by nefarious actors, from domestic extremists in the United States and Europe to Russian President Vladimir Putin. His basic argument is hardly controversial: digital technology has changed how people analyze, manipulate, and understand politics. Yet he does show how deep-seated the problem is. These trends have been building for decades. The fact that those who contributed to them, or sought to combat them, often had little idea what they were doing—or what the long-term consequences would be—does not bode well for Baldwin’s concluding proposal to rescue democracy through a “soft reboot” of digital technology. Nonetheless, Baldwin’s journalistic personality—curious, garrulous, and ironic—shines through the many amusing anecdotes about how things got to be this way."
4,Governing Europe in a Globalizing World: Neoliberalism and Its Alternatives Following the 1973 Oil Crisis,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2019-04-16/governing-europe-globalizing-world-neoliberalism-and-its,Governing Europe in a Globalizing World: Neoliberalism and Its Alternatives Following the 1973 Oil Crisis,"The two decades following the oil crisis of 1973 were a decisive period in the history of the EU. During that time, governments launched the Single European Act, harmonized regulations, promoted financial and monetary integration, and suppressed traditional industrial policies—a combination of policies often described as “neoliberal.” Now, historians with access to primary documents can explain in detail how and why this happened. Although Warlouzet is sometimes tempted to exaggerate the range of potential choices governments faced, in the end, his book proposes some clear answers. Governments freed up markets because they had little choice: the major alternatives, notably the protection and subsidization of national champions, had proved costly and ineffective. Leaders turned to the EU to coordinate the shift not because European idealists persuaded them to do so but because it seemed the optimal way to commit one another to collective liberalization: the EU was large enough to be effective without being as diverse and unwieldy as global institutions. Yet the result was not uniformly neoliberal. Policies such as regulatory protection, social welfare provision, and state support for agriculture and other declining sectors remained essential elements of a distinctively balanced European model."
5,The Responsive Union: National Elections and European Governance,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2019-04-16/responsive-union-national-elections-and-european-governance,The Responsive Union: National Elections and European Governance,"Nearly all commentators, even staunch federalists, echo the Euroskeptical charge that the European Union is a distant institution populated by unaccountable technocrats and double-dealing politicians. Most social scientists go along with this story as well, arguing that almost all European issues are too obscure and complex to generate sustained and meaningful popular attention and engagement. This important book turns the conventional wisdom on its head with a simple yet profound observation: in reality, the EU responds to the democratic demands of its citizens. The governments of member states, constantly worried that the public could suddenly notice and mobilize around an EU issue, habitually stake out strong negotiating positions that appear to defend clear social interests. Schneider also reveals a narrower phenomenon: governments delay EU decisions that might trigger unfavorable outcomes until after national elections—and their counterparts in other capitals generally play along. One might conclude that European governments collude to fool all the people all the time by pushing unpopular policies only when their citizens aren’t looking. In the end, Schneider remains ambivalent about how much the public controls EU policy and about the prospects for meaningful democratic reform in Europe."
6,The Academy of Fisticuffs: Political Economy and Commercial Society in Enlightenment Italy,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2019-04-16/academy-fisticuffs-political-economy-and-commercial-society,The Academy of Fisticuffs: Political Economy and Commercial Society in Enlightenment Italy,"The eighteenth-century Enlightenment marked a decisive historical turning point: from that moment on, a distinctively modern conviction spread that durable progress toward peace, tolerance, and welfare was feasible. Previous political and social theorists tended to believe instead that self-interest inclined individuals to commit acts of unspeakable evil against one another—a fate only intermittently softened by virtuous leaders or altruistic religious beliefs. Most people think of the Enlightenment as centered in France, Scotland, and perhaps Germany. In this erudite and engaging intellectual history, Reinert makes the case for the critical role played by a pioneering group of Italian political economists who gathered in the cafés of Milan, notably Cesare Beccaria and the brothers Pietro and Alessandro Verri. They studied the socializing impact of commerce and espoused the inalienable rights of man not to suffer cruel punishment—just as Montesquieu, Voltaire, Adam Smith, and Immanuel Kant did elsewhere. This suggests not just that the Enlightenment was more widespread than many think but also that the twin processes of market globalization and state formation already at work in that era made it inevitable—although in this case, as in France, large doses of caffeine helped."
7,The Final Act: The Helsinki Accords and the Transformation of the Cold War,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2019-04-16/final-act-helsinki-accords-and-transformation-cold-war,The Final Act: The Helsinki Accords and the Transformation of the Cold War,"In 1975, the Helsinki Final Act—an accord among the United States, the Soviet Union, and virtually every European country—formalized the era’s East-West détente. This book represents perhaps the most richly documented account of the negotiations, which are best remembered for enshrining a strongly Western conception of human rights but also sketched out a far broader code of conduct for East-West relations, including the mutual recognition of stable borders. Most of the participants hoped the agreement would stabilize and legitimate the status quo and thus tone down the Cold War, although a few Western countries hoped the document might ultimately help bring down the Soviet bloc. Morgan endorses the widespread belief that the agreement was decisive in ending the Cold War. This is odd, because his own evidence belies such a claim. The accord was nonbinding, and efforts by Western diplomats to promote human rights soon collapsed into diplomatic acrimony. In the early 1980s, the Soviets and their henchmen handily crushed opposition groups in Eastern Europe. Only the atrophy of the Soviet system and the eventual entry into office of Mikhail Gorbachev—neither caused by the Helsinki agreement—eventually put an end to the Cold War."
8,Of Privacy and Power: The Transatlantic Struggle Over Freedom and Security,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2019-04-16/privacy-and-power-transatlantic-struggle-over-freedom-and,Of Privacy and Power: The Transatlantic Struggle Over Freedom and Security,"Globalization means that the domestic policies of one country can influence the welfare of other countries. This interdependence affects an ever-widening range of regulatory matters in areas such as environmental protection, macroeconomic policy, and individual rights. As compared to the security conflicts and tariff disputes of centuries past, today’s regulatory fights mobilize a broader range of domestic bureaucracies, civil society groups, and other political actors—some with the ability to form political alliances across borders. In this brief book, two scholars examine a recent series of such disputes between the United States and its European partners over coordinating transnational flows of information about airline passengers, bank accounts, and commercial transactions. In general, the United States sought more access to data for the government and private firms, whereas the European countries favored more individual protections. The authors show that negotiations over these issues, both within and across nations, tend to be complex and fraught, not least because they pit intense commercial and security interests against deep-seated norms of individual privacy. When it is expedient, groups representing these interests have mobilized internationally. The book shows how government officials, nongovernmental organizations, and legislators reached across borders in this way. Yet it remains unclear what effect transnational activity had on the ultimate policies the United States and Europe chose, which have generally tracked relative power and interests."
9,The Lessons of Tragedy: Statecraft and World Order,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/lessons-tragedy-statecraft-and-world-order,The Lessons of Tragedy: Statecraft and World Order,"Brands and Edel belong to a new generation of American foreign policy thinkers and practitioners. Most of this generation begins its analysis with the failure of the United States to create the stable, peaceful, and democratic world order that presidents from George H. W. Bush to Barack Obama tried to build. Many react to that failure by embracing some form of retrenchment. Brands and Edel, in contrast, worry about what the world would look like if the United States pulled back. For them, U.S. foreign policy should be less about building utopia than about preventing disaster. World order is a fragile thing, human nature is as flawed as it has always been, and the abyss is never far away. China, Iran, and Russia, they argue, are not merely geopolitical nuisances. They are attacking the values and institutions of open societies with all the tools of the information age. Unless met with resolute American power guided by wise strategies, they will return the world to an age of catastrophic war. This is an unfashionable message, but Brands and Edel have a lot of history on their side. Having squandered so many of the opportunities presented by the end of the Cold War, the United States must now contend with a harsher world, under a darkening sky."
10,Clear and Present Safety: The World Has Never Been Better and Why That Matters to Americans,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2019-04-16/clear-and-present-safety-world-has-never-been-better-and-why,Clear and Present Safety: The World Has Never Been Better and Why That Matters to Americans,"Cohen and Zenko give a new meaning to President Franklin Roosevelt’s Depression-era slogan “The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.” Whether one looks at terrorists, rival great powers, or any other prominent threat from beyond U.S. borders, the authors maintain, the United States has little or nothing to worry about. Noncommunicable diseases kill many times as many Americans as foreign terrorists do, for example. Americans would be better off if they worried less about relatively weak enemies abroad and spent more money fighting cancer and heart disease at home. Cohen and Zenko argue that Americans’ priorities are so misplaced because of a “Threat-Industrial Complex” that hypes international dangers. Clear and Present Safety makes some effective points about the costs of ill-considered war, and as memories of World War II and the Cold War recede, it is possible that Cohen and Zenko’s reasoning will appeal to new generations of policymakers. Yet readers who can recall the consequences of the United States’ turn inward in the 1920s and 1930s will find Cohen and Zenko’s proposals disturbing; history suggests that the only foreign policy costlier and riskier than one that pursues global engagement is one that shuns it."
11,Finding My Voice: My Journey to the West Wing and the Path Forward,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2019-04-16/finding-my-voice-my-journey-west-wing-and-path-forward,Finding My Voice: My Journey to the West Wing and the Path Forward,"As U.S. President Barack Obama’s longtime personal friend and a close adviser during his presidential administration, Jarrett had an unrivaled perspective on Obama’s years in power. Like most political memoirs, Finding My Voice is not a literary classic, but readers nostalgic for the Obama era will enjoy Jarrett’s account of a consequential presidency. At her best, Jarrett reminds readers that Obama, like Jimmy Carter and George W. Bush before him, possessed a human decency that dignified both the man and the office. Jarrett recalls how after meeting with a group of African American teenagers enrolled in a Becoming a Man program in Chicago, Obama kept in touch with the young men and invited them to the White House. Since the visit was scheduled to take place near Father’s Day, the young men decided to give the president a Father’s Day card. One of them told Obama: “I’ve never signed a Father’s Day card before.” “Me neither,” responded the leader of the free world."
12,The Back Channel: A Memoir of American Diplomacy and the Case for Its Renewal,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2019-04-16/back-channel-memoir-american-diplomacy-and-case-its-renewal,The Back Channel: A Memoir of American Diplomacy and the Case for Its Renewal,"Few American diplomats have had as distinguished and varied a career as has Burns. His lucid and panoramic memoir draws a sharp contrast between what he sees as the peak of U.S. diplomatic success during the George H. W. Bush administration and the more confused and discouraging scenes of recent years. Back then, the triumphal conclusion of the Cold War, the extraordinary success of U.S. military force and diplomacy in the Persian Gulf War, and the hope of a future of peaceful democratic progress gave the United States a prestige and influence that no nation can command today. The book describes the serial failures by Democratic and Republican presidents that, in Burns’ judgment, contributed to the United States’ current distress. A final, forward-looking chapter offers Burns’ thoughts about rebuilding U.S. diplomacy. His suggestions, including pruning back what he sees as an overgrown National Security Council and building public support for diplomacy, deserve careful attention."
13,Ukraine and the Art of Strategy,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2019-04-16/ukraine-and-art-strategy,Ukraine and the Art of Strategy,"The crisis in Ukraine has proved a watershed moment for Russia’s relations with the West. It also is an important case study on the use of force to achieve political objectives. Freedman presents a brief history of the conflict and analyzes it in the context of strategic theory. He calls into question the idea that Russian President Vladimir Putin is a strategic genius, noting that Russia is in a far less advantageous position today than it was before the invasion of Crimea in February 2014. After the Maidan revolution in Kiev that month, Freedman writes, “Putin could have waited to see how events unfolded,” but he instead chose to act without considering the long-term consequences. The invasion then set in motion a series of events that left Russia stuck in a conflict in the Donbas and alienated from the rest of Ukraine. Freedman’s judgment that the “biggest failures were Russian,” however, may be premature: Moscow seems to be playing a long game, betting that both Ukraine’s will to fight and the West’s interest in Ukraine will fade as the war drags on."
14,The Case for Trump,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2019-04-16/case-trump,The Case for Trump,"Hanson claims to present a case for U.S. President Donald Trump, but his carefully hedged apologia offers no real defense of the president’s ethics, learning, rhetoric, or character. What separates Hanson from the majority of commentators is less his assessment of Trump’s personality than his analysis of the American situation before Trump’s election. For Hanson, the United States in 2016 was locked into an accelerating decline that only desperate measures could reverse. Hanson compares Trump to such figures as Pike Bishop in Sam Peckinpah’s film The Wild Bunch and Ethan Edwards in John Ford’s The Searchers. A good man would not have the skills needed for a dirty job; Hanson’s Trump is a tragic antihero who will be rejected by the respectable people he saved once his work is done. Few of the president’s critics will be convinced by The Case for Trump; they will, however, profit from reading a book in which one of red America’s most articulate exponents explains a worldview that elected a president and that continues to animate millions of Americans."
15,Two Books on the Risks of Nuclear Terrorism and Proliferation,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2019-04-16/two-books-risks-nuclear-terrorism-and-proliferation,Two Books on the Risks of Nuclear Terrorism and Proliferation,"Both of these books address the risks of nuclear terrorism and proliferation. Sokolski’s slim, urgent volume describes different attitudes to the spread of nuclear weapons and outlines a largely geopolitical approach to reducing the likelihood of proliferation. He recommends more dialogue among China, Russia, and the United States; suggests that nuclear powers should deploy their weapons in ways that reduce the risks of inadvertent escalation; and counsels those powers to update the safeguards surrounding exports of civil nuclear reactors."
16,Atlas of World War II: History’s Greatest Conflict Revealed Through Rare Wartime Maps and New Cartography,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2019-04-16/atlas-world-war-ii-historys-greatest-conflict-revealed-through,Atlas of World War II: History’s Greatest Conflict Revealed Through Rare Wartime Maps and New Cartography,"This splendid book is largely based on artifacts and maps collected by Kenneth Rendell for his International Museum of World War II, in Massachusetts. The archival material is backed up by over 100 new maps illuminating many of the most important battles and campaigns of the war, along with an illustrated history of the campaigns, the people involved, and their kit. The new cartographic work is excellent, but the stars of the book are the high-quality reproductions of maps first produced as part of the war effort. These include the Allied invasion plan for Sicily in 1943, a table map used by the British Fighter Command during the Blitz, and playing cards with backs that pows could peel off to reveal escape maps printed on tissue paper. The book also features presentations on the organization of Moscow’s defense in August 1941, a situation map from Nazi General Erwin Rommel’s North African campaign, and Japanese maps covering the first stages of Japan’s December 1941 offensive."
17,The New Rules of War: Victory in the Age of Durable Disorder,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2019-04-16/new-rules-war-victory-age-durable-disorder,The New Rules of War: Victory in the Age of Durable Disorder,"McFate demonstrates a lively and provocative way to think about modern warfare in a book laced with examples from the history of conflict as well as his own career as a soldier in the U.S. Army and a professor at Georgetown University’s School of Foreign Service. His starkest argument is that “conventional war is dead,” while lesser war and peace exist side by side, and that much great-power conflict takes place in a gray zone between the two. McFate does a good job conveying the messiness of contemporary warfare, describing a shift from wars between states to wars within states. Great powers pursue their interests by using whatever nonmilitary tools are available, from social media to trade, and try to avoid serious fighting. Nonstate actors, on the other hand, use whatever weapons they can get their hands on. At times, McFate overstates for effect. For example, he dismisses high-end conventional capabilities too readily: along with nuclear weapons, such military options—even when they are not used—help explain why great powers are wary about embarking on major wars."
18,Two Books on Espionage and Covert Operations,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2019-04-16/two-books-espionage-and-covert-operations,Two Books on Espionage and Covert Operations,"Policymakers are often tempted to use covert operations as a way of limiting risks. If plans go wrong, leaders suppose they can deny responsibility, avoiding retaliation and escalation. Yet in order to stay secret, covert operations are often too small to make a real difference. In his history of British covert operations since 1945, Cormac covers a wide range of activities by British spies and special forces, including training saboteurs in Albania, working to undermine the Irish Republican Army in Northern Ireland, acting with U.S. forces to overthrow the government of Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddeq in Iran, and dealing with insurgents in Oman. Cormac’s history shows more misses than hits, and he demonstrates that even some apparent successes, such as the Iranian coup, backfired in the long run. He suggests that over the last 75 years, the United Kingdom’s covert efforts were largely about compensating for, or masking, the country’s declining power. In particular, the British were eager to demonstrate to the United States that they could still contribute to joint overseas endeavors."
19,Industrial Policy and the World Trade Organization: Between Legal Constraints and Flexibilities,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2019-04-16/industrial-policy-and-world-trade-organization-between-legal,Industrial Policy and the World Trade Organization: Between Legal Constraints and Flexibilities,"Many governments want not only to grow their economies but also to influence how they are structured. To do so, they pursue industrial policies. Yet international organizations place limits on the extent to which governments can meddle in economic affairs. This informative book describes what forms of industrial policy are consistent with the rules of the World Trade Organization. The book is densely written and thick with legal terminology, but it is valuable as an authoritative reference work. In addition to analyzing WTO policies, Shadikhodjaev provides a useful catalog of areas where the wto’s rules are ambiguous and suggests how they might be clarified and improved."
20,The Future of Capitalism: Facing the New Anxieties,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2019-04-16/future-capitalism-facing-new-anxieties,The Future of Capitalism: Facing the New Anxieties,"Collier is unhappy with the direction that societies have taken, especially the United Kingdom and the United States. People have lost their sense of obligation to fellow citizens and place too much emphasis on the individual. Collier suggests that widening social divisions—between booming cities and backwaters, between well-paid workers and those who are falling behind—have made individualism unsustainable. Drawing on extensive research, he suggests several policies, such as representing the public interest on company boards, that might narrow the gaps. The book is especially interesting on education, covering both preschool and adult learning. Collier concludes that a revived communitarian national identity can counter the trend toward shallow individualism."

So far, the robbers have mostly outpaced the cops. The volume of illicit trade—in drugs, in smuggled goods, in human beings—has expanded rapidly over the last three decades as the Internet has made anonymous communication easier, although some of the increase is due to greater awareness and new laws and regulations that sweep up more activities. Most of the wrongdoers are propelled by greed, but some are also driven by a lack of legal ways to make a living. Reducing illicit trade, Shelley concludes, will take more than passing new laws. It will mean restructuring the financial and corporate worlds to improve accountability and transparency and curb destructive environmental practices."
22,Blaming Immigrants: Nationalism and the Economics of Global Movement,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2019-04-16/blaming-immigrants-nationalism-and-economics-global-movement,Blaming Immigrants: Nationalism and the Economics of Global Movement,"Although immigration dominates the headlines, public beliefs about immigrants, as recorded in polls, often differ wildly from the facts. This timely and informative book lays out those discrepancies and discusses why they persist. Global migration, Kaushal argues, does not present a crisis, whatever populist politicians claim. As she points out, “the number of immigrants as a proportion of world population has not budged for over a century.” Many people, she argues, blame immigrants for unrelated problems. In the United States, for example, people usually imagine that foreigners carry out most terrorist attacks, and President Donald Trump has raised fears of terrorists crossing the border from Mexico. Yet native-born Americans, not immigrants, are responsible for a large majority of the attacks on U.S. soil, and none of the perpetrators has come from Mexico."

Volcker recounts the role he played in abandoning the last vestiges of the gold standard, his struggle with inflation as chair of the U.S. Federal Reserve, the time he spent dealing with the 2008 financial crisis and its aftermath, and his examination of the UN’s oil-for-food program in Iraq. Following his father, who served for two decades as the city manager of Teaneck, New Jersey, Volcker has spent his life in public service. His career has been characterized by his extraordinary integrity—a term not now associated with either politicians or bankers. Volcker’s final reflections emphasize three public virtues: price stability, sound finance, and good governance. The necessary condition for the last, stressed by Alexander Hamilton, is not just sound policies but also wise management by well-trained, nonpartisan, experienced professionals. The book concludes with a plea to young Americans to devote themselves to public service."

Drawing on his years as a diplomat, Barton argues that although the United States has stumbled badly in humanitarian interventions, it should not abandon the task but rather go about it in new ways, working with local groups and staying in the background. Barton draws specific lessons from several recent U.S. interventions. In Bosnia, the United States created incentives for people to collaborate by supporting local institutions that cut across ethnic divides. In Rwanda, after the genocide, aid to women in the countryside encouraged small steps toward peace. After the 2010 earthquake in Haiti, the lesson was to direct economic assistance to local civic leaders who had the trust of the wider public. In the future, states will continue to fail or collapse into civil war, and ethnic violence will continue to sprawl across poor regions of the world. Barton’s message to American decision-makers is to be humble and patient and to stay as close as possible to the people at the bottom of society."

Under the Treaty of Versailles, the French did not get the security guarantees they wanted, the Germans were humiliated, the Americans spurned the League of Nations, and outside the West, nationalist movements for self-determination were thwarted. Sharp, however, offers a more sympathetic judgment of Versailles. World War I had set in motion vast forces that were almost too much for diplomats to manage: the collapse of four empires, the implosion of the European great-power order, the Anglo-American power transition, the rise of revolutionary Russia, and the spread of new ideas about self-determination. Sharp argues that the treatment of Germany—a “tough peace” that lacked an enforcement mechanism and undermined Germany’s fragile democracy—was doomed to fail. But the League of Nations, he says, opened up a new era of social and economic cooperation and laid the foundation for the un. A century after Versailles, self-determination has triumphed, but many of the dilemmas faced by the peacemakers of 1919 remain."

In the decades before 1914, Germany tried to supplant the United Kingdom as Europe’s leading power, whereas Russia allied itself with a weakened France. The United States attempted to prop up the United Kingdom’s great-power status after World War II but sought to weaken the Soviet Union as it crumbled in the 1980s. In this book, Shifrinson provides an elegant theory to explain these variations. A rising state tries to weaken its fading rival only if it concludes that the declining state will not be useful in checking other rival states and lacks the ability to strike back. Before 1914, for example, Germany improved its ties with a declining Austria-Hungary so as not to be bereft of allies as it faced the Triple Entente. Today, a rising China might not seek to weaken a declining United States if Washington can help Beijing restrain other great powers, such as Japan and Russia, or if the United States still poses a significant military threat."
27,The Globalization Backlash,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2019-04-16/globalization-backlash,The Globalization Backlash,"Today’s nationalist backlash is coming from both the right and the left. The right attacks immigration as a threat to identity and community, and the left believes global capitalism is undermining labor and the welfare state. Crouch does not dismiss these critiques, but he argues that in both cases, the cure will be worse than the disease. At home, a reactionary nationalism based on a left-right coalition would make no one happy—and most people poorer. Abroad, antiglobalism would usher in a dangerous era of world politics driven by zero-sum competition. Globalization’s most striking accomplishment is the economic rise of non-Western societies: since 1990, a billion people outside the advanced economies have emerged from poverty. Trade has also promoted social and cultural exchange and learning. Crouch concludes that had the world not globalized, it would be far poorer, illegal immigration would be higher, and international relations would be more hostile. Crouch’s bottom line is that there can be no return to a pre-globalized era. The only path forward is for countries to jointly manage the flows of goods, capital, and people."

In the wake of the attack, the intelligence community mobilized with one overriding goal: preventing another 9/11. The CIA, the National Security Agency, and the 15 other components of the U.S. intelligence community restructured, reformed, and retooled.

30,Back to Basics,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/united-states/back-basics,Back to Basics,"U.S. President Donald Trump’s sharp-elbowed nationalism, opposition to multilateralism and international institutions, and desire to shift costs onto U.S. allies reflect the American public’s understandable weariness with acting as the global order’s defender and custodian. Over the last three decades, post–Cold War triumphalism led to hubris and clouded strategic thinking. After the 9/11 attacks, Washington stumbled badly in Afghanistan and Iraq; more recently, Russia has reasserted itself in eastern Europe and the Middle East, and China’s economic and military power have significantly expanded. Even among Trump’s opponents, these developments have led many to conclude that the only solution is a fundamental rethinking of U.S. strategy."

But he began and ended his career struggling with how to resolve two American wars: first in Vietnam, then in Afghanistan."

The authors show that there has been a high degree of electoral continuity since the transition to multiparty politics in the early 1990s. They attribute this tendency to two factors: the persistence of presidential systems and the “liability of newness,” meaning most African countries’ limited experience with multiparty politics, which benefits incumbents at the expense of opposition parties. One of the volume’s major contributions is to put African elections in comparative perspective. Bleck and van de Walle’s focus on the “normality” of African elections, alongside their more unusual characteristics, offers a useful corrective to the dominant narrative of Africa’s unique electoral politics. The book also convincingly rebuts accounts of democratic backsliding and overly optimistic views of democratic consolidation. It shows that, in reality, there has been relatively little change since the democratic transitions of the early 1990s."

The embargo was later followed by sanctions on trade, investment, and lending. The regime responded by creating a sophisticated network of organizations and agents around the world that it used to keep weapons and crucial economic goods, such as oil, flowing. In this impressive but sprawling account, van Vuuren draws on archival material and interviews to reveal how the South African government got around the sanctions and how France, the United Kingdom, and the United States subverted the rules. Throughout the 1980s, South Africa used friendly banks in Europe to maintain lines of credit to finance the acquisition of weapons and military technology worth hundreds of millions of dollars. Secrecy, restrictions on the South African press, intense diplomacy, connections with foreign intelligence services, and lobbying abroad ensured the success of South Africa’s illicit global network until the end of the Cold War."

After the UN’s founding, the imperial powers started to incorporate economic development objectives into their colonial policies to help legitimate their rule. As Pearson’s probing account makes clear, this quickly put them at odds with the UN’s fledgling development architecture. Focusing on the area of public health, Pearson shows that France sought to reap the benefits of the World Health Organization’s operations in Africa, even as it pursued its own health-care policies in its colonies. France’s efforts, Pearson argues, succeeded in maintaining French influence over UN policies in West Africa even after the country’s former colonies had won their independence."

Nathan’s careful deconstruction of electoral politics in Accra, Ghana’s increasingly prosperous capital, shows one instance in which the theory does not hold. Middle-class Ghanaians continue to vote for politicians who follow a logic of ethnic favoritism and clientelism, promising rewards to their bases of support. He argues that the low capacity of the Ghanaian state, the huge unmet demand for state resources, and the presence in Accra of many poor recent migrants from the countryside all push politicians to continue their successful past strategies."

Some are fairly well known—South Sudan’s split from Sudan, for instance, or the emergence of a de facto state of Somaliland within Somalia. But the contributors also analyze several less well-known cases, including that of the island of Anjouan, which declared independence from the Comoros in 1997 only to rejoin in 2001, and the emergence of a secessionist movement in the Caprivi region, in northeastern Namibia. No two cases are the same, but secessionist demands usually originate in some combination of a desire to escape economic or political marginalization, historical grievances, and unhappiness with institutional arrangements. Most intriguing, some movements start as gambits to gain attention from the national government and foreign powers. Discontent with the national borders inherited from colonialism has been a constant of postcolonial African politics, even if those tensions have led to secession in only two cases, Eritrea and South Sudan."

Clark focuses on the ICC’s work in Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, but his analysis applies more broadly. He argues that the ICC is a Western-dominated organization that often intervenes in Africa without giving enough deference to national institutions and with little understanding of local politics—much like the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. The ICC keeps its headquarters outside Africa and employs few staffers on the continent, a decision it justifies by the need to remain impartial in local political disputes. But the result, Clark explains, has been that the ICC engages little with local African communities and decision-makers, even as it has become ensnared in African politics. Clark argues that a more effective ICC could do a lot of good in Africa. He’s right—but to get there, the ICC will have to listen to his compelling criticisms."
38,Taiwan’s Former Nuclear Weapons Program: Nuclear Weapons On-Demand,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2019-04-16/taiwans-former-nuclear-weapons-program-nuclear-weapons-demand,Taiwan’s Former Nuclear Weapons Program: Nuclear Weapons On-Demand,"Taiwan has come close to developing nuclear weapons on two occasions, in 1977 and again in 1988, despite constant pledges to the United States that it was doing no such thing. Only the most persistent surveillance and intense pressure from Washington ended the program. The nonproliferation experts Albright and Stricker offer the most complete version yet told of this little-known story, based partly on the recollections of a high-ranking CIA informant inside the program. A key lesson is that nuclear enrichment programs are seldom for truly peaceful purposes, as their developers often claim. Even after pledges of nonproliferation and acceptance of inspection regimes, the temptation to cheat remains strong so long as enrichment and R & D facilities are still in place. The authors believe that Taiwan is more secure without nuclear weapons than it would have been with them. But the opposite argument will never lose its appeal—in Taiwan or, for that matter, in Japan, Saudi Arabia, or South Korea—so long as American allies have a shred of doubt about the reliability of the U.S. commitment to defend them against nuclear-armed rivals."

Chinese dissidents, the U.S. government, and Internet giants went up against the Chinese state—and lost. Software built to help Chinese users leap over the Great Firewall to reach foreign websites has been checkmated. Facebook, Google, and others surrendered to Chinese censorship demands in order to access the Chinese market. And China’s homegrown tech giants, which are loyal to the regime, seized control of the market. Beijing outspent its challengers in order to field cutting-edge censorship technology, often purchased from American suppliers. Now it is exporting both its technology and its ideology of cyber-sovereignty to other countries. Griffiths condemns the “moral failing” of Silicon Valley firms and despairs that “the censors are on the advance.”"

In this sardonic insider account, he portrays Pakistani politics as a formless scrum in which the army, the president, the prime minister, feudally organized political parties, the U.S. ambassador, and the Saudi intelligence chief lobby and scheme with no institutional limits and no one in charge. Durrani’s account is cynical and persuasive. He contends that every major Pakistani policy decision—except developing nuclear weapons—has been a mistake, including creating a crisis in the Kargil area of contested Kashmir in 1999, knuckling under to U.S. demands after the 9/11 attacks, sending troops to quash resistance in tribal areas, and, above all, trusting the United States. He is just as hard on other countries, however—arguing, for example, that U.S. goals in Afghanistan are doomed to failure because the American presence strengthens, rather than weakens, the Taliban and weakens, rather than strengthens, the client regime in Kabul."

Religious minorities, members of lower castes, and others pushed to protect their traditional rights. The court blocked the government when it tried to prohibit alcohol, modified the government’s ban on cow slaughter, allowed it to take certain measures but not others to control commodity prices, and used procedural grounds to side-step a challenge to the government’s suppression of prostitution. In telling these stories, De illuminates a diverse, litigious society seeking to solve issues through its laws. The Supreme Court remains one of India’s most powerful institutions, implementing a constitution that places heavy emphasis on citizens’ rights."

Fravel shows that this doctrine has changed a remarkable nine times—a reflection of how difficult China’s military situation was when, as a developing country, it sought to defend a large and exposed territory from fearsome rivals, including India, Japan, the Soviet Union, and the United States. Fravel highlights the most consequential changes of strategy and explains how they came about in response to shifts in other countries’ fighting capabilities, and at moments when China’s turbulent domestic politics were calm enough to let military leaders rethink the country’s defense challenges. The most recent strategic guidelines, however, reflect a new situation: rising Chinese power. Issued in 2014, they call for “winning local informatized wars”—in other words, being prepared to beat the United States in a high-tech military conflict in the South China Sea or over Taiwan."

Ho’s penetrating, theoretically informed study shows how these movements built on networks created in previous protest episodes and analyzes how the protesters interacted with the authorities. The Sunflower Movement gave impetus to the election of the opposition candidate Tsai Ing-wen in Taiwan’s 2016 presidential election. But the Umbrella Movement, even though it lasted 79 days, was ultimately crushed, leaving the territory’s pro-democracy parties weakened. Together, the protests showed how pressure from Beijing can strengthen local identities, a dynamic also evident in Tibet and Xinjiang. Ho suggests that similar resistance may emerge elsewhere if China pushes too hard."
44,Japan Rearmed: The Politics of Military Power,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2019-04-16/japan-rearmed-politics-military-power,Japan Rearmed: The Politics of Military Power,"Washington’s relationship with Tokyo is generally considered the most important of the United States’ 70-odd alliances. In this intimately knowledgeable book, Smith shows how that alliance looks to the Japanese: increasingly unreliable. Japan has done much to keep the United States committed to its defense: raising its defense budget, upgrading equipment and training, and deploying troops overseas as part of un missions and U.S.-led coalitions. It has also strengthened its forces’ independent ability to fend off air and maritime probes from China and Russia and potential missile attacks from North Korea. But as threats from all three neighbors intensify, the Japanese are less and less sure that the United States will defend them in a crisis. Some Japanese policymakers now argue that the country must develop a self-reliant defense, to be used if and when U.S. credibility deflates completely. Given Japan’s geography, however, the only effective defense would be deterrence, which would breach the ban on offensive capabilities contained in the country’s “peace constitution.” The Japanese public is not yet willing to make that leap, but opinion is shifting."

He identifies two U.S. blind spots: the huge power imbalance between Israel and the Palestinians and the U.S. assumption that the Palestinians will have to make most of the concessions. American policy has varied over the years, but on one issue it has remained largely constant: the denial of any right of return to Palestinian refugees. Although the United States supported a un resolution in 1948 affirming that right and another in 1967 urging a just settlement for the refugee problem, Washington has never given more than tepid support to the return of even token numbers of refugees. U.S. acquiescence to the Israeli settlements in territories Israel captured during the 1967 Arab-Israeli war has followed a similar trajectory. First seen as illegal, settlements are now embraced by most American politicians as something akin to a God-given right for Israelis. In this respect, President Donald Trump is merely building on the foundations laid by presidents of both parties before him, including Barack Obama."

Three chapters exploring efforts to address past abuses, by Kora Andrieu, Frédéric Vairel, and Nathalie Bernard-Maugiron, portray the results as an act of political fragmentation in Tunisia, a well-rehearsed drama in Morocco, and a farce in Egypt, respectively. Filiu, meanwhile, examines what he calls the “modern Mamluks” in Algeria, Egypt, Syria, and Yemen, referring to the Middle East’s praetorian slave dynasties of the Middle Ages. He describes a bleak landscape but nonetheless wagers that those countries will liberalize, placing his hopes on “popular steadfastness.” Steven Cook and Tarek Masoud each compare the military establishments in Egypt, Libya, Tunisia, and Turkey. It would be useful to compare these militaries with those of Jordan, Morocco, and Saudi Arabia, all of which are monarchies. It is hard not to conclude that these experiments in liberalization, save, perhaps, Tunisia’s, have landed the countries back on square one, with the important caveat, noted by Marc Lynch, that the Mamluks now have digital media to play with."

Although he does not bring much new to the table, he treats the subject deeply and thoroughly. Hiro’s most controversial and important argument is that Iran’s nuclear program was directed mainly at Iraq, not Israel. Once Iran learned, after the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003, that Iraq’s nuclear program had been mothballed, Iran shut down its own, a fact reported in a U.S. National Intelligence Estimate in 2007. Therefore, Hiro concludes, Iran has little reason to revive its program. As for the Saudis, Hiro finds few redeeming features in Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the de facto ruler of the kingdom, whose agenda Hiro sees as tantamount to “a totalitarian regime in the making.” When MBS, as he is known, accedes to the Saudi throne, he will probably have half a century in which to indulge his anti-Iranian impulses."

The group, led by Rached Ghannouchi, bears much resemblance to Egypt’s Muslim Brotherhood, but McCarthy, who spent two years interviewing members, brings out the major differences. The most important is that after al Nahda’s founding in the 1970s, the group never had time to build up the kind of welfare and educational infrastructure that the Muslim Brotherhood did. As a result, when President Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali crushed al Nahda after it did unexpectedly well in the election of 1989, the group did not have a network to fall back on. What its members did have, as McCarthy masterfully depicts, were the binding experiences of prison and torture, followed by isolation and police surveillance after they were released. In 2016, al Nahda took the radical step of abandoning its mission of religious transformation, known as dawa in Arabic, in order to become an exclusively political party. Liberals applauded the move, but Salafi Islamists saw it as a betrayal. McCarthy shows that many members of al Nahda agreed."

Pollack, who has studied them for nearly two decades, exhaustively explores four explanations for their ineffectiveness: their reliance on Soviet military doctrine, the politicization of the officer corps, the economic underdevelopment of Arab societies, and Arab culture. All are important, but only the last has real explanatory power. By comparing Arab militaries with non-Arab ones from countries at similar levels of development, Pollack is able to sort out what matters. His careful and sensitive analysis points to patriarchy, group loyalty, obedience, and the fear of failure—all characteristics reenforced by the Arab educational system—as the leading explanations. His fascinating tour begins in 1948 and considers a long series of engagements involving conventional and guerrilla forces. Despite the book’s length, it misses a few cases, including the Algerian War of Independence, from 1954 to 1962, which pitted the National Liberation Front against the French, and the Sudanese military’s long struggle with southern rebels, which culminated in South Sudan’s independence in 2011. His argument is well supported, but his analysis of the effects of education before 1967 does not hold water, as so few Arab recruits had formal schooling in that period. Still, the book will make for painful reading among Arab military professionals."

Raúl Castro certainly succeeded in diversifying Cuba’s international commercial relations, although the chronic weakness of the country’s domestic economy prevented the island from fully capitalizing on his shrewd diplomacy. In a strategic failure, Castro did not adequately prepare Cuba’s energy sector for the collapse of the country’s close ally Venezuela. Cuba now faces a much less friendly external environment than it did a mere two years ago, when the contributions to this volume were written. In both the United States and Latin America, governments have come to power that are hostile or indifferent toward Havana. The volume’s chapters on China and Russia suggest that neither power is likely to step full force into the breach. In retrospect, the decade of Raúl Castro’s rule appears as a fleeting golden era for Cuban foreign policy."

According to that view, democracies too often loosen moral constraints and give excessive protections to criminals. Yashar rejects that theory and points to three other explanations for the violence. First, many governments have found it next to impossible to clean up weak or corrupt military and police forces, which are often in bed with criminal organizations. Second, criminality, especially the drug trade, creates highly lucrative business opportunities without legal channels for settling disputes, compelling criminals to resort to deadly force. Finally, competition among criminal organizations (and between them and state agencies) over turf or trade routes generally results in bloodshed. Yashar illustrates her arguments with studies of post-civil-war El Salvador, Guatemala, and Nicaragua. She attributes Nicaragua’s relatively low levels of crime to the root-and-branch reconstruction of the security forces after the 1979 revolution and to the adoption of community-based policing. Unfortunately, her field research dates from 2007, before President Daniel Ortega repoliticized the security forces, which last year dutifully fired on peaceful protesters, killing hundreds."

Several of his predecessors sought to foster inter-American harmony by building roads instead. The result was the Pan-American Highway, whose 30,000 miles link Alaska to Tierra del Fuego, at the southern tip of South America. As Rutkow shows in this history of the highway, the various justifications for building the road included promoting automobile exports, fortifying antifascist defenses during the 1930s and 1940s, and advancing economic and social development in Latin America. Rutkow does an excellent job linking the domestic politics and economies of the countries along the highway to the international diplomacy that made it possible. Well-known American leaders, including Henry Clay, Andrew Carnegie, and George Marshall, have colorful cameos. As Rutkow shows, some Latin American countries, most notably Argentina, saw the project as a Trojan horse for U.S. imperialism. Unfortunately, Rutkow does not examine this history in detail, as his coverage of South America is far less complete than his impressive research on Mexico and Central America."

As a result, nearly half a million deportees who grew up in the United States, many identifying as Americans, now live in Mexico, where they have struggled to adapt. Drawing on heart-rending interviews with deportees, Caldwell argues that “deportation is particularly cruel for functional Americans. It not only undermines family connections, career paths, and other attachments, but also strikes at the core of people’s identities.” Caldwell finds shock, trauma, shame, resentment, loneliness, and rejection among her interviewees, even as some eventually succeed in new ventures. She reminds readers that before the U.S. Congress reformed the immigration system in 1996, courts could allow immigrants to remain based on such mitigating factors as their family ties, how long they had lived in the United States, and their employment history. Caldwell decries the inconsistencies between the legal definition of citizenship and people’s experiences of rootedness. She argues that citizenship should be based on a person’s cultural associations rather than on national boundaries."
54,Why Nationalism,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2019-04-16/why-nationalism,Why Nationalism,"Nationalism has returned to the world stage, wrapped in the nativistic and xenophobic rallying cries of populist and authoritarian demagogues. But as Tamir argues in this important book, nationalism has another, more civic-minded side. For Tamir, this enlightened nationalism provides the societal glue that makes social democracy possible. Tamir retells the history of nationalism, emphasizing its more progressive contributions. In the nineteenth century, nationalism gave the world the modern nation-state, which then provided its citizens with rights. Later, nationalism proved a potent force in the struggle for self-determination and the end of empire. Tamir traces the Western liberal disenchantment with nationalism to the horrors of Nazism, ethnic cleansing, genocide, and world war. The postwar rebirth of Europe was premised on overcoming nationalism. After the Cold War, the worldwide spread of economic and political liberalism seemed to confirm that it was globalism, not nationalism, that generated progress. Tamir argues that this view is no longer sustainable, as globalism is now fueling reactionary nationalism. The challenge for defenders of liberalism and social democracy is not to oppose nationalism but to recover its we-are-all-in-it-together sensibility."

Bloch foresaw with stunning prescience how smokeless gunpowder, improved rifles, and other emerging technologies would overturn contemporary thinking about the character and conduct of war.

Fewer people are killed on the battlefield, on the streets, and in homes. Led by the psychologist Steven Pinker, who has collected reams of evidence demonstrating that humanity has slowly but surely grown more peaceable, a new group of thinkers is urging policymakers and the public to consider not just what the world is doing wrong in terms of violence but also what it is doing right."

Some of the most stirring recent political openings, such as those in Egypt and Myanmar, have slammed shut. The United States and several long-standing democracies in western Europe are struggling with serious democratic challenges, especially the rise of illiberal populist forces. And the two most significant nondemocratic powers, China and Russia, are strutting on the global stage."

Already, more than a dozen governments have announced national AI initiatives. In 2017, China set a goal of becoming the global leader in AI by 2030. Earlier this year, the White House released the American AI Initiative, and the U.S. Department of Defense rolled out an AI strategy."
61,The Dark Side of Sunlight,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/united-states/dark-side-sunlight,The Dark Side of Sunlight,"The U.S. Congress is broken. Legislators prioritize political posturing and self-aggrandizement over the actual business of legislation. They have caused two costly and pointless shutdowns of the federal government in the past two years alone. Despite his campaign promises, President Donald Trump has not, in fact, drained the swamp. The Republicans’ 2017 tax reform bill set off a frenzy of lobbying, and in the 2018 midterm elections, total campaign spending broke the $5 billion mark for the first time. The only lawmakers who buck the party line tend to be those who have already announced their retirement—and even then, they dissent only rarely and with trepidation. No wonder 76 percent of Americans, according to a Gallup poll, disapprove of Congress."
62,The End of Hubris,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/united-states/end-hubris,The End of Hubris,"Today’s world presents a seemingly endless array of challenges: a more powerful and assertive China, novel threats from cyberspace, a rising tide of refugees, resurgent xenophobia, persistent strands of violent extremism, climate change, and many more. But the more complex the global environment, the more Washington needs clear thinking about its vital interests and foreign policy priorities. Above all, a successful U.S. grand strategy must identify where the United States should be prepared to wage war, and for what purposes."
63,The Open World,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/open-world,The Open World,"Since the election of U.S. President Donald Trump in 2016, it has become commonplace to bemoan the fate of the U.S.-led liberal international order—the collection of institutions, rules, and norms that has governed world politics since the end of World War II. Many experts blame Trump for upending an otherwise sound U.S. grand strategy. They hope that once he is gone, the United States will resume the role it has occupied since the fall of the Soviet Union: as the uncontested hegemon ruling benevolently, albeit imperfectly, over a liberalizing world."
64,Hard Truths in Syria,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/syria/2019-04-16/hard-truths-syria,Hard Truths in Syria,"Over the last four years, I helped lead the global response to the rise of the Islamic State (ISIS)—an effort that succeeded in destroying an ISIS “caliphate” in the heart of the Middle East that had served as a magnet for foreign jihadists and a base for launching terrorist attacks around the world. Working as a special envoy for U.S. Presidents Barack Obama and Donald Trump, I helped establish a coalition that was the largest of its kind in history: 75 countries and four international organizations, their cooperation built on a foundation of U.S. leadership and consistency across U.S. administrations. Indeed, the strategy to destroy the ISIS caliphate was developed under Obama and then carried forward, with minor modifications, under Trump; throughout, it focused on enabling local fighters to reclaim their cities from ISIS and then establish the conditions for displaced people to return."
65,The New German Question,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/germany/2019-04-02/new-german-question,The New German Question,"Many have been lamenting the dark path that Europe and the transatlantic relationship are currently on, but there hasn’t been much discussion of where that path leads. European weakness and division, a strategic “decoupling” from the United States, the fraying of the European Union, “after Europe,” “the end of Europe”—these are the grim scenarios, but there is a comforting vagueness to them. They suggest failed dreams, not nightmares. Yet the failure of the European project, if it occurs, could be a nightmare, and not only for Europe. It will, among other things, bring back what used to be known as “the German question.”"
66,The Lost Art of American Diplomacy,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/united-states/lost-art-american-diplomacy,The Lost Art of American Diplomacy,"Diplomacy may be one of the world’s oldest professions, but it’s also one of the most misunderstood. It’s mostly a quiet endeavor, less swaggering than unrelenting, oftentimes operating in back channels, out of sight and out of mind. U.S. President Donald Trump’s disdain for professional diplomacy and its practitioners—along with his penchant for improvisational flirtations with authoritarian leaders such as North Korea’s Kim Jong Un—has put an unaccustomed spotlight on the profession. It has also underscored the significance of its renewal."

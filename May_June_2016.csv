0,Putin’s Russia,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/issue-packages/2016-04-20/putins-russia,What’s Inside,"Over the past decade and a half, Vladimir Putin’s Russia has been an economic dynamo and a basket case, an imperfect democracy and a tightening tyranny, a constructive diplomatic actor and a serial military aggressor—sometimes all at once. The only constant has been surprise, as the zigging and zagging has left outside observers, and even many Russians, scratching their heads."
1,Reading Hume in Tehran,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/review-essay/2016-04-18/reading-hume-tehran,Reading Hume in Tehran,"When Iran makes headlines, it is usually as a result of its conflicts with other countries. Far less attention is paid to Iran’s conflicts with itself, which are still raging nearly 40 years after the revolution that brought forth the Islamic Republic. Despite the images of a monolithic, repressed, hyper-devout society that sometimes serve as a shorthand for Iran in Western media, the country is in fact the site of a great deal of political and ideological contestation. As Laura Secor writes in her new book, Children of Paradise, “Iran does not have a culture of passive citizenship, despite the best efforts of its rulers, past and present, to produce one. What it does have in many quarters is a restless determination to challenge injustice and to seize control of its destiny.”"
2,Made in Africa: Learning to Compete in Industry,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/made-africa-learning-compete-industry,Made in Africa: Learning to Compete in Industry,"Based on eight case studies of countries in sub-Saharan African, this book argues for a renewed emphasis on industrial development in Africa. The authors start with the premise that the industrial sector is the key to rapid and sustained economic development in the region. They believe that Africa’s industrial performance has been marred by poor policies that have undermined productivity and suggest that better results will require investment in export-oriented industries, from which rapidly developing Asian countries are beginning to divest. Through careful firm-level analysis, the authors conclude that the single most important factor is the need to create more competition. Their policy recommendations include some familiar measures, such as improving infrastructure and embracing regulatory reforms to increase foreign direct investment. More interesting is their proposal to promote the development of “firm clusters”—hubs where companies with complementary skills can learn from one another."
3,"Making and Unmaking Nations: War, Leadership, and Genocide in Modern Africa; From War to Genocide: Criminal Politics in Rwanda, 1990–1994",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/making-and-unmaking-nations-war-leadership-and-genocide-modern-africa-war,"Making and Unmaking Nations: War, Leadership, and Genocide in Modern Africa; From War to Genocide: Criminal Politics in Rwanda, 1990–1994","Straus’ previous book was a penetrating analysis of the 1994 genocide in Rwanda. Here, he returns to the issue of large-scale ethnic violence in Africa, demonstrating an impressive command of the historical material to contrast the cases of Rwanda and Sudan, where genocides took place, with three cases in which ethnic conflict did not reach that point (Côte d’Ivoire, Mali, and Senegal). In the end, he concludes, whether interethnic strife results in genocide depends almost entirely on national leadership. Straus argues that African genocides occur during civil wars when governing elites prove willing and able to mobilize the majority of the population and the state apparatus to commit systematic violence against an ethnic minority. That is what happened in Rwanda and Sudan; in the other three countries, leaders instead embraced a pluralistic nationalism that made space for ethnic minorities and sought to end their civil wars through negotiation."
4,The Bad-Ass Librarians of Timbuktu,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/bad-ass-librarians-timbuktu,The Bad-Ass Librarians of Timbuktu,"In 2012, Islamist extremists linked to al Qaeda managed to take control of a large swath of northern Mali, on the lower edges of the Sahara Desert, before the French military eventually dislodged them, with U.S. support. Hammer tells the dramatic story of how, during the period of Islamist rule, a group of Timbuktu residents saved some 350,000 ancient manuscripts that had resided in the city since its medieval heyday as a great center of learning and scholarship. Hammer’s hero is a scholar and book collector, Abdel Kader Haidara, who has devoted his life to preserving these texts with the help of a network of prominent families in Timbuktu and, increasingly, international financial support. Rightly worried that the Islamists would consider this remarkable collection of works to be heretical and would therefore destroy it, Haidara and his colleagues organized a remarkably courageous and ingenious effort to smuggle them out of the city and on to safety in Bamako. In addition to weaving a great yarn, Hammer also provides a fascinating history of Timbuktu and its books and a well-informed account of the struggle against Islamist extremism in the Sahel."
5,"The Real Politics of the Horn of Africa: Money, War, and the Business of Power",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/real-politics-horn-africa-money-war-and-business-power,"The Real Politics of the Horn of Africa: Money, War, and the Business of Power","This excellent introduction to the recent history of the Horn of Africa focuses on the Machiavellian maneuvering of the region’s elites. A well-connected, veteran observer of the region, de Waal is perfectly placed to untangle the domestic politics of Eritrea, Ethiopia, Somalia, and the Sudans. He argues that politics in the region operates much like a market, with constant intrigue over the buying and selling of power and influence. This is a familiar analysis, but de Waal applies it well in explaining why the countries of the Horn have proved politically unstable in recent decades. Without the support of powerful organizations or mobilizing ideologies to back them, political entrepreneurs survive only if they can secure material resources and receive funding from external patrons, which they use to purchase political support—a recipe for instability. This book’s greatest strength is its regional lens, as de Waal reveals how elite alliances operate across borders. For a desperately poor area with awful infrastructure and vast expanses of desert, the Horn has produced a surprisingly globalized and cosmopolitan political ecosystem."
6,The Most Wanted Man in China: My Journey From Scientist to Enemy of the State,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/most-wanted-man-china-my-journey-scientist-enemy-state,The Most Wanted Man in China: My Journey From Scientist to Enemy of the State,"Fang’s memoir is a bildungsroman of dissent, a story of the political education of a Chinese scientist: his youth as a loyal Communist in the early 1950s, his gradual disillusionment with the revolutionary state, his efforts to reform it, and finally his expulsion from China in 1990, after which he taught astrophysics at the University of Arizona until his death in 2012. Fang’s engaging narrative and careful analysis have been lucidly translated by Link. The book reveals how the Chinese Communist Party ruined itself and squandered its resources in the first four decades after it took power in 1949. The mind of the physicist is at work here: Fang describes the forces of political entropy and examines how people found ways to build a humane order in spite of political repression. The text is full of gems for specialists in Chinese politics and history, but it is also important as the testament of an important Chinese political dissident who arrived at liberalism not through Thomas Jefferson and political theory but through Albert Einstein and astrophysics, all while living through Mao Zedong’s revolutions. If ever there was a case for a link between science and democracy, this is it."
7,Regulating the Visible Hand? The Institutional Implications of Chinese State Capitalism,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/regulating-visible-hand-institutional-implications-chinese-state-capitalism,Regulating the Visible Hand? The Institutional Implications of Chinese State Capitalism,"Many China observers lament the increasing dominance of the state sector in the Chinese economy, which distorts markets and breeds corruption. Analysts frequently suggest remedies such as privatizing more state enterprises and taking steps to level the playing field so that private businesses can better compete with state-owned firms. Liebman, Milhaupt, and their collaborators demonstrate in rich detail that the reality is more complicated and that such reforms would change little. Chinese state capitalism is rooted in institutions that permeate the economy and society. The Chinese Communist Party controls companies not only through ownership but also through its influence over employees who are party members. Courts favor state-owned enterprises, talented graduates aim for careers in state-dominated sectors, and private enterprises rely on favors from the government to survive. The Chinese brand of state capitalism is distinct from other versions owing to China’s Leninist-style party-state and the lack of genuine rule of law, which have left China ill prepared for the new challenges of global economic volatility. Chinese state capitalism cannot be undone through isolated reforms; what’s needed is a reform of the state itself."
8,PLA Influence on China’s National Security Policymaking,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/pla-influence-chinas-national-security-policymaking,PLA Influence on China’s National Security Policymaking,"Saunders and Scobell have assembled leading authorities on civil-military relations in China, a subject of great importance for U.S.-Chinese relations and East Asian security. This highly informative volume covers, among other things, the role of China’s military in formal policymaking institutions and specifically in Chinese policy toward North Korea and Taiwan and in the South China Sea. Taken together, the essays suggest that the People’s Liberation Army’s interests and perspectives differ from those of other sectors of China’s foreign policy apparatus and reflect the military’s responsibility to defend the country’s security and territorial integrity. Nonetheless, it seems clear that the Chinese Communist Party retains firm control over the military, including when it comes to weapons procurement and the use of force. The absence of an effective Chinese interagency policymaking system grants the PLA privileged access to civilian elites, especially on intelligence matters, which means the military could have significant influence on Chinese decision-making during a crisis. The essays in this volume also suggest that the lack of institutionalized interagency foreign policy coordination enables the Chinese military to conduct provocative maritime operations in distant waters, which might undermine Chinese diplomacy and contribute to international tensions."
9,"The U.S.-China Military Scorecard: Forces, Geography, and the Evolving Balance of Power, 1996–2017",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/us-china-military-scorecard-forces-geography-and-evolving-balance-power-1996,"The U.S.-China Military Scorecard: Forces, Geography, and the Evolving Balance of Power, 1996–2017","Heginbotham and his colleagues synthesize a great deal of information that is otherwise hard to find and understand. They develop detailed, rigorously reasoned scorecards that assess how Chinese and U.S. forces would perform against each other in a confrontation over Taiwan or the Spratly Islands. They consider each side’s likely ability to cripple its adversary’s air bases, sink its surface ships, blind its space satellites, shoot down its fighter planes, and disable its computer networks. The results are not surprising, but they are alarming for Washington: U.S. dominance is a “receding frontier,” although the gap between Chinese and American abilities varies from scorecard to scorecard. The fact that the United States is far away from the potential battlefields protects the homeland but gives China an advantage in sustaining military operations, especially in the Taiwan scenario. The rand scholars make a number of controversial recommendations, among them that Washington needs to reconsider the positioning of U.S. military bases in Asia, which are heavily concentrated within Chinese missile range in Japan and South Korea; invest more in cruise missiles that could disable Chinese airfields; and develop smaller aircraft carriers that are less vulnerable to Chinese submarine and missile attacks."
10,Pyongyang Republic: North Korea’s Capital of Human Rights Denial,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/pyongyang-republic-north-koreas-capital-human-rights-denial,Pyongyang Republic: North Korea’s Capital of Human Rights Denial,"The survival of the North Korean regime depends partly on the way it distributes material privileges in a series of rings around a dynastic core. Around 200,000 high-level elites live in central Pyongyang in nearly First World conditions. They must continuously demonstrate absolute loyalty to the ruling Kim dynasty or suffer instant banishment to a labor camp. Midlevel officials are trusted even less, live farther out, and contend with some hunger and cold. In the next ring resides what Collins describes as a “lesser elite,” whose members are grateful for the limited access they enjoy to food, housing, health care, running water, electricity, and heating, because they know about the extreme deprivation suffered by the 85 percent of the population that is not allowed to live in the capital city. Collins describes the system in fascinating detail and identifies two dozen key regime figures who would be prime candidates for U.S. sanctions or international criminal prosecutions if the regime were ever called to account for its human rights violations."
11,Japan: The Precarious Future,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/japan-precarious-future,Japan: The Precarious Future,"This collection of lucid essays by leading experts takes stock of Japan’s many problems: extreme susceptibility to natural disasters, an aging society, the decline in permanent employment, a lack of women in the work force, excessive limits on immigration, a paralyzed energy policy in the wake of the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster, a weak manufacturing sector, high government debt, and the rapid turnover of political leaders. All of that adds up to a fairly grim portrait. Only two chapters are moderately optimistic, noting Japan’s technological lead over China and the political system’s ability to gradually generate a stronger security posture in response to Chinese assertiveness, despite frequent changes of administration. Japan is still a formidable force in the global economy and in regional politics. Yet solutions to its problems seem to be blocked by a combination of cultural preferences and vested interests."
12,"China’s Hidden Children: Abandonment, Adoption, and the Human Costs of the One-Child Policy",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2016-04-15/chinas-hidden-children-abandonment-adoption-and-human-costs-one,"China’s Hidden Children: Abandonment, Adoption, and the Human Costs of the One-Child Policy","Johnson, an adoptive parent, set out to understand the circumstances that produced so many abandoned baby girls in China in the 1980s and 1990s—more than 120,000 of whom were adopted overseas, mostly by people in the United States. She confirms the conventional view that some rural parents abandoned girls under the pressure of China’s coercive one-child policy. But she explodes the myth that Chinese parents do not value girls. It turns out that many illegal second children were kept hidden by their birth families at the risk of being punished by local authorities, and many other babies were informally adopted, also at great risk, by families who already had a boy and wanted a girl. Local officials “confiscated” such children when they found them, swelling orphanage populations and feeding the revenue-producing international adoption market. The recent gradual loosening of the one-child policy does not change the fact that “out of plan” children may be seized from loving birth or foster parents, inflicting enduring pain on both generations. Johnson’s extraordinary book conveys the intense suffering of ordinary people struggling to build families against the will of an implacable bureaucracy."
13,The Saudi Kingdom: Between the Jihadi Hammer and the Iranian Anvil,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2016-04-15/saudi-kingdom-between-jihadi-hammer-and-iranian-anvil,The Saudi Kingdom: Between the Jihadi Hammer and the Iranian Anvil,"Although not a member of the Saudi royal family, Shihabi is a Western-educated Saudi businessman committed to the survival of the House of Saud. In this forcefully argued book, he portrays the monarchy’s potential downfall as an unmitigated disaster that would lead to the collapse of the smaller Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states and that would create a void that could be filled only by jihadists or Iran. He is highly critical of the sprawling network of princes and Wahhabi clergy on the state dole, and he argues that Islamism is mostly a vessel for class antagonism. He calls for the state to embrace some reforms—budget transparency, a sharp reduction in the size of royal patronage networks, and fewer restrictions on debate—and he hopes that King Salman will lead the way. Shihabi sees little reason to believe that the nuclear deal that world powers reached with Iran last year will change the Islamic Republic’s disruptive behavior in the Middle East, and he calls for the GCC to admit Yemen, with its 25 million people, which would nearly double the council’s population and make the GCC a more credible counterweight to Iran."
14,The Pragmatic Superpower: Winning the Cold War in the Middle East,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2016-04-15/pragmatic-superpower-winning-cold-war-middle-east,The Pragmatic Superpower: Winning the Cold War in the Middle East,"Takeyh and Simon survey ten episodes—including the 1953 coup in Iran, the 1956 Suez crisis, the 1967 Six-Day War, the 1979 Iranian Revolution, and the 1990 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait—to make the case that U.S. strategy in the Middle East during the Cold War was remarkably successful. This is familiar terrain, and the authors do not introduce any significant new information, so their argument depends a great deal on interpretation. Throughout the Cold War, Washington protected oil markets, denied the Soviets increased access to the Arab world, and safeguarded Israel. But it is hard to discern an articulated U.S. strategy behind those goals. American officials rarely anticipated the moves of other key actors but rather lurched from one unanticipated crisis to another with reactive and improvised policies. The results were surprisingly good, given the disarray. Readers may conclude that matters could have been a lot worse—except, perhaps, when it came to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict."
15,Until We Are Free: My Fight for Human Rights in Iran,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/until-we-are-free-my-fight-human-rights-iran,Until We Are Free: My Fight for Human Rights in Iran,"In 1975, Ebadi became the first-ever female judge in Iran. But after the Iranian Revolution, the new theocratic authorities stripped her of her position, claiming that Islam forbids women to serve as judges. Nevertheless, she was still allowed to practice law, so she founded the Defenders of Human Rights Center and represented abused women, journalists, activists, religious minorities, and many other targets of the regime’s brutality and victims of Iran’s corrupt legal system. In 2003, she was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, which enraged the regime. For years, she was hounded by intelligence agents, and her clients, relatives, and, ultimately, husband were routinely bullied and threatened. In 2009, she went into exile, where she remains. In this disturbing memoir, Ebadi skims over what may be a fundamental divide in Iranian society, one that separates the elite classes, from which she hails, from the lower-middle classes, which produced most of her adversaries. She has no doubt that a substantial majority of Iranians want to see the back of the regime. Nevertheless, she is not optimistic about the prospects for reform under Iran’s current president, the relatively moderate Hassan Rouhani, although she hopes that he might relax some strictures on public debate."

He introduces readers to people such as Mohamed Beltagy, a relatively young Muslim Brotherhood leader in Egypt who tried to steer the group toward compromise following its electoral victories in 2012. Beltagy wound up in jail, sentenced to death; a sniper killed his teenage daughter. In Jableh, Syria, Worth meets two teenage girls—a Sunni and an Alawite—whose friendship is ruined by sectarian identities that had meant little to them before 2011. In Yemen, Worth watches as the despot Ali Abdullah Saleh, who had been driven from power in 2011, reemerges to join forces with Shiite Houthi rebels. These stories don’t quite add up to a bigger picture, but they all revolve around Arabs’ quest for a state that is fair and free of corruption and that treats its people as citizens. Worth avers that support for the Islamic State (also known as ISIS) may represent a perverse version of that quest."
17,Engineers of Jihad: The Curious Connection Between Violent Extremism and Education,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/engineers-jihad-curious-connection-between-violent-extremism-and-education,Engineers of Jihad: The Curious Connection Between Violent Extremism and Education,"Beware engineers! In their examination of individuals involved in violent extremism of all kinds, Gambetta and Hertog find engineers to be massively overrepresented in right-wing movements, both secular and religious. Not all engineers are violent extremists, of course, but an astonishing proportion of right-wing (but not leftist) extremists are engineers. The authors hypothesize that engineering attracts individuals who yearn for order, social “purity,” and some mythical halcyon days of yore. The argument is not watertight, but it is data-driven and carefully constructed. Gambetta and Hertog take a close look at jihadist engineers, many of whom started promising mainstream careers in the 1950s and 1960s. At that time, they were hailed as the future leaders of newly independent states in the Muslim world, but in the 1980s, they crashed against a wall of failing economies, cronyism, and corruption. Some of them went on to become the architects of utopian Islamist movements and demonstrated no qualms about using violence. Although engineers belong to both violent and nonviolent Islamist movements, they seem particularly drawn to the violent variety."
18,Return to Cold War,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/return-cold-war,Return to Cold War,"Since the onset of the Ukrainian crisis, experts have debated how to characterize the latest phase of U.S.-Russian relations, now at their lowest ebb since before the Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev came to power. In his timely new book, Legvold argues convincingly that Washington and Moscow have entered a second Cold War, which could become even more dangerous than the first one, owing to an unstable global environment and new challenges such as cyberwarfare and terrorism. He suggests that instead of ostracizing the Russians, the Americans should acknowledge their own role in the deterioration of relations and should take steps to reengage with the Kremlin. He offers a number of concrete suggestions for how the two countries could find ways to cooperate on matters including Euro-Atlantic security arrangements and defusing tensions in Northeast Asia. The conflict over Ukraine will remain a sore spot, he acknowledges, but it could be resolved if other aspects of the relationship improved. Legvold’s call for U.S. reengagement raises serious questions about Russia’s willingness to respond, and on what terms. Confrontation with the West has become a fundamental tool for legitimizing the Kremlin’s rule. It’s not clear under what circumstances that could change."
19,The New Tsar: The Rise and Reign of Vladimir Putin,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2016-04-15/new-tsar-rise-and-reign-vladimir-putin,The New Tsar: The Rise and Reign of Vladimir Putin,"What is it about Vladimir Putin that makes people want to write books about him—many more, it seems, than about any other currently serving leader or, indeed, any recent leader? Most of the authors of these books are journalists such as Myers; Russia seems to get into their blood, and Putin, an improbably striking character, is at the center of the country’s turbulent existence and effect. Myers retraces familiar ground: Putin’s childhood, KGB service in East Germany, entry into Leningrad politics, ascent in Moscow, and consolidation of power, and the various twists and dramas of his time in power, including the ongoing Ukrainian conflict. What Myers adds to this oft-told tale are revealing details, texture, and nuance made possible by the seven years he spent reporting from Russia for The New York Times. For readers looking for a full, highly readable account of Putin and the era he has shaped, this is the book."
20,On Stalin’s Team: The Years of Living Dangerously in Soviet Politics,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/stalins-team-years-living-dangerously-soviet-politics,On Stalin’s Team: The Years of Living Dangerously in Soviet Politics,"It might seem strange to describe a book about Joseph Stalin and his entourage as a sheer pleasure, but that’s what Fitzpatrick’s book is. Simple, honest, and direct, but subtle in tone, it manages to convey what was human and complex about something stark and inhuman. Fitzpatrick reconstructs the relations among Stalin and the small circle of lieutenants who remained close to him—and, with varying intensity, to one another—over a remarkable 30 years. These men were not merely rubber stamps for a dictator’s autocratic decisions; they exerted force within the spheres of their responsibility. (Stalin, of course, always had the last word.) In the early days of the Soviet era, they were buoyant with revolutionary energy. Later, they were driven apart during the Great Purge in the late 1930s, reenergized by World War II, and ultimately able to hold the Soviet system together after Stalin’s death in 1953. All remained loyal to Stalin until the very end, even when subjected to his wrath, and they all genuinely believed that he had merits far greater than theirs. One comes away from this book with a far better sense of what it must have been like within the inner sanctum as it went about its business: sometimes heroic, all too often monstrous."
21,"The Depths of Russia: Oil, Power, and Culture After Socialism",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/depths-russia-oil-power-and-culture-after-socialism,"The Depths of Russia: Oil, Power, and Culture After Socialism","Rogers, an anthropologist, is not as interested as most observers in how money, power, and politics mix in Russia and echo in its foreign policy. Rather, he focuses on how things work within oil corporations: how the new oil giants evolved out of Soviet carcasses; how they operate in symbiosis with the state; and, in particular, how they directly shape social and cultural institutions. He zeroes in on a single region, Perm, which drove the Soviet Union’s first oil boom, from 1929 until the 1970s; a single company, Lukoil, which inherited parts of the Soviet conglomerates, including a vast refining operation; and one key sphere of the subsidiary Lukoil-Perm’s social activity, the promotion of local cultural traditions. The intersection of oil, money, and power might be a sexier topic. But the ways in which politicians and corporate bosses redefine and blend roles on the ground—indeed, to the point that Lukoil-Perm assumed the lead in a grand campaign to make the city of Perm a “capital of culture,” competing with St. Petersburg—provide more insight into the real texture of everyday politics."
22,Velvet Revolutions: An Oral History of Czech Society,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2016-04-15/velvet-revolutions-oral-history-czech-society,Velvet Revolutions: An Oral History of Czech Society,"Vanek and Mucke are Czech oral historians who have applied their craft to reveal how 300 Czechs from all walks of life—factory workers, teachers, electricians, doctors, soldiers—remember the communist era of their youth: their schools, workplaces, and friendships, as well as the political norms and hazards that shaped and abraded their lives. Their memories of what preceded 1989—“the crack,” as many people refer to the collapse of socialism—are mixed and human, full of simple pleasures: evenings at the pub, good and bad teachers, holidays, and the rhythms of the workday. They appreciate the new freedoms they now have—if they can afford them. But they frown on the anomie, materialism, self-absorption, and inequities of the postcommunist era and resent those who have found ways to game the new system. The striking thing is that notwithstanding the fundamental differences between the political system in which they spent most of their lives and that of the United States, their outlook on the past and the present appears not all that different from that of Americans of the same generation."
23,Beyond Crimea: The New Russian Empire,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/beyond-crimea-new-russian-empire,Beyond Crimea: The New Russian Empire,"Scarcely any aspect of Russian foreign policy has received more attention and less serious exploration than Russia’s maneuvering in former parts of the Soviet Union. Grigas takes a sizable step toward rectifying that imbalance by carefully tracing Moscow’s approach to so-called compatriots—ethnic Russians, Russian speakers, and those who simply identify with Russia—in these now independent states. Russian foreign policy is a Rorschach test, and Grigas’ interpretation will satisfy many—but not all. Grigas details how Russia uses hard power, soft power, and something in between: for example, bestowing Russian passports on compatriots who are citizens of other countries. Her purpose is to prove that Russia is trying to reconstitute an empire, drawing its identity and motivations from a script that traces back to the sixteenth century. Russia, she argues, begins its interventions in its neighbors’ affairs by making claims on behalf of allegedly threatened compatriots and then, step by step, resorts to cruder mechanisms. Finally, if conditions permit, Russia turns to subversion and military force, as it did in Georgia in 2008 and Ukraine in 2014."
24,The Red Web: The Struggle Between Russia’s Digital Dictators and the New Online Revolutionaries,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/red-web-struggle-between-russias-digital-dictators-and-new-online,The Red Web: The Struggle Between Russia’s Digital Dictators and the New Online Revolutionaries,"This could have been a narrowly told story of how the Internet came to Russia and now pervades the lives of most of its citizens. Instead, although the authors do trace the jury-rigged early Russian connections to the Web in the late 1980s, they tell a much broader tale. They delve into the Kremlin’s efforts to commandeer this new medium, the interplay between state-controlled media and the more freewheeling Internet, and the ingenuity of the young paladins who have kept information flowing over the Internet despite the best efforts of Russia’s security services. The authorities now eavesdrop on virtually every form of communication in the country, from e-mail to Skype. But the Kremlin has been unable to bring the Internet to heel and ensure that only the regime’s views proliferate. Soldatov and Borogan, two young journalists, dogged and nervy, are detectives, tracking down the players on all sides. They weave the results into something close to a high-tech adventure."
25,The Versailles Restaurant Cookbook,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/versailles-restaurant-cookbook,The Versailles Restaurant Cookbook,"To understand the influence of political strife on the recipes and ingredients in people’s ever-changing dining habits, academics now study “conflict cuisine.” Founded by Cuban immigrants in 1971 in Miami’s Little Havana neighborhood, the restaurant Versailles embodied conflict cuisine before the term became trendy. Like its namesake, Versailles is an elegant icon of an upended ancien régime, mixing nostalgia for a lost homeland with kitsch decor that recalls a style of 1950s Miami. For decades, Cuban Americans have gathered at the restaurant to plot their revenge against the man who stole their birthrights, Fidel Castro. No paladar (privately owned restaurant) in Cuba can match Versailles’ seating capacity of 400, as the Cuban government places a tight limit of 50 chairs on such establishments. Versailles is also an obligatory stop for politicians courting the Cuban American vote. Quincoces and Valls recognize that Cuban fare, rooted in Spanish traditions, is relatively simple, and the accessible recipes they offer cover all the basics: classic sofrito marinade (garlic, onion, tomato, bell peppers), ropa vieja (shredded flank steak), black beans and rice, a rich flan, and strong Cuban coffee. The light, informative text considers, among other things, the fiery debates over the true origins and proper contents of the Cuban sandwich, which typically includes some combination of roast pork, ham, Swiss cheese, pickles, and mustard."

As the country’s most famous poet, Rubén Darío, famously remarked, “If small is the homeland, one dreams it great.” In his highly original book, Chávez seeks the literary and philosophical roots of three very different Nicaraguan regimes: the modernizing, authoritarian Somoza dictatorship (1937–79), the agrarian-socialist Sandinista revolution (1979–90), and the neoliberal capitalism of the post-Sandinista era (1990–2006). All three regimes were “utopian” in that their legitimizing rhetoric and imagery contained contradictory elements that were impossible to reconcile or fully realize and that obscured their less savory characteristics. Chávez carefully dissects official speeches and constitutional texts and expertly elucidates their literary and discursive origins. His critiques of two outstanding contemporary writers, Sergio Ramírez and Gioconda Belli, are especially well drawn, as he guides readers from their early anti-Somoza mythological stories and poems to their subsequent writings on political disillusionment. But Chávez is no cynic: on the contrary, he asserts that the drive to imagine a better, more hopeful future is profoundly and gloriously human."

A Fragmented Continent expertly explores one issue that produces sharply divergent attitudes: climate change. American Crossings intelligently considers why Latin America is a region substantially at peace with itself."
28,Routledge Handbook of Latin America in the World,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2016-04-14/routledge-handbook-latin-america-world,Routledge Handbook of Latin America in the World,"The foreign policies of Latin American states have been woefully understudied. This comprehensive collection of essays by senior international relations scholars is a magnificent corrective to that shameful lacuna. The contributors place their analyses within familiar theoretical frameworks, dive deeply into empirical evidence, and keep their essays—30 in all—lucid and succinct. The collection covers the foreign policies of every major Latin American country; regional multilateralism and economic integration schemes; and issues such as human rights, counternarcotics, global environmental governance, and migration. Oddly, there is only one brief (although solid) essay on U.S. foreign policy even though many of the contributions contemplate Latin American efforts to restrain U.S. power. Alas, the pace of change in the region is so fast that the enthusiasm some of the authors demonstrate for assertive left-leaning governments that seek autonomy from U.S. influence is already a bit behind the curve, as Argentina turns toward economic pragmatism, Cuba’s Raúl Castro embraces U.S. President Barack Obama, and Venezuela flounders. Nevertheless, this authoritative handbook should be enthusiastically received by anyone searching for high-quality material on Latin America’s role in the contemporary world."

This is particularly true with regard to Russia. In recent years, EU officials in Brussels have become more active in regulating competition and funding infrastructure in the energy sector, with an eye toward limiting Russian leverage, which stems mostly from European countries’ dependence on Russian natural gas. Meanwhile, individual EU member states have continued to adapt to evolving energy markets, with policies whose substance depends largely on the extent of their energy dependence and their financial means. These developments have had a decisive impact on diplomacy with Russia and the crisis in Ukraine: it is ultimately the EU that decides whether pipelines and connectors are built. The complex and conspiratorial world of energy politics is tough to research. Although more detailed and ambitious works on the subject exist, this volume of EU-funded research offers a useful introduction to some of the key data and perspectives."

This book contains more than 40 of his essays published over the past 25 years, covering everything from the French Revolution, Napoleon, and the Vichy government to contemporary politics and culture. Most of these essays are book reviews that engage authors in critical dialogues and that originally appeared in The New Republic, the London Review of Books, and other periodicals. But Bell is not a typical academic turned high-end journalist: he does not simply summarize books or briefly mention them as a springboard for a bit of reportage or op-ed writing. Instead, he seeks to stimulate serious debate about the past. For him, the test of a good argument is its fidelity to contextual details as historical actors actually perceived them. Although Bell writes well, his reviews do not always make for easy reading, given the complexity of his approach. Still, the book offers unusually rewarding insights into the past and the many ways it continues to influence contemporary France."

Gross shows how German businessmen and academics in the Weimar and Nazi periods used development projects, trade fairs, scholarly research, and educational exchanges to help entrench Germany’s role as the primary trade partner for many of its neighbors, establish itself as a development model, and fix its position atop central Europe’s hierarchy of states. Gross stretches the terms “informal imperialism” and “soft power” to encompass this type of behavior, which immediately evokes images of Nazi imperialism. Yet his most telling conclusion is that Germany’s informal influence during the interwar period had more in common with today’s relations among the United States, European countries, and smaller states than with Adolf Hitler’s military grasp for Lebensraum (living space) and a formal empire. In many ways, Hitler’s counterproductive military expansion and ethnic cleansing reversed the interwar policy of mutually beneficial inducement and persuasion. This book offers an interesting historical perspective on the active trade and investment policies of great powers today."
32,Government Favoritism in Europe,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2016-04-14/government-favoritism-europe,Government Favoritism in Europe,"Public infrastructure projects and other types of government procurement almost everywhere in the world suffer from favoritism and corruption, if not outright criminality. The spoils always go to the people with the right connections, wealth, or the willingness to use or threaten violence. This is among the most difficult aspects of governance for scholars to study: those who talk don’t know, and those who know don’t talk. This slim volume summarizes detailed studies of favoritism in Bulgaria, Croatia, Hungary, Italy, Romania, Turkey, and Ukraine. A final chapter shows how criminal organizations in many countries—including Mafia-like groups in Bulgaria and Italy—infiltrate national and EU-level public spending projects. Each chapter is packed with a remarkably rich set of charts, graphs, and statistical analyses that capture how much corruption exists and how it works. These succinct and eye-opening quantitative estimates of what really goes on beneath the surface of government make for indispensable reading and should straighten out anyone who doubts that the powerful always find ways to reinforce their influence and wealth, even on the “cleanest” of continents."
33,Scotland Now: A Warning to the World,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2016-04-14/scotland-now-warning-world,Scotland Now: A Warning to the World,"The recent rise of Scottish nationalism has exposed the ideological contradictions of British conservatism. Among British Conservatives are Burkean nationalists who reject Scottish nationalism, Thatcherites who warn Scots not to trim their public sector, extremists who criticize the pro-independence Scottish National Party (for being extremist, naturally), and believers in “one nation” conservatism in theory who are dividing the United Kingdom in practice by striking a cozy electoral bargain with Scottish nationalists. In politics, when partisans contemplate such contradictions, they tend to fulminate, and Gallagher is no exception: his book is twice as long as it need be, not least because it is bloated with sarcastic asides, accusations of cynical motives, and the persistent use of quotation marks to indicate irony. Gallagher manages to see everything except the one thing he cannot: the central role the Conservative Party has played in leading so many modern Scots to despise being part of the United Kingdom. Yet he adds something to the conventional view of the Scottish issue as merely an unfortunate disagreement between two well-meaning groups, idealistic nationalists and sensible unionists. He highlights that even without the independence movement, Scotland is becoming a populist one-party state. Governments in such places, he rightly warns, tend to be insular, intolerant, interventionist, and corrupt."

Bush, and Obama administrations, skewering all three for their various mistakes. He argues that, bequeathed a rare gift of peace, prosperity, and relative international calm, the post–Cold War presidencies often wandered off into undisciplined adventures in humanitarianism and quixotic nation building, most of which turned out badly. Instead of squandering blood, treasure, and reputation on “foreign policy as social work” (as Mandelbaum put it in these pages two decades ago), Washington should have focused on other countries’ external behavior, not their internal politics. Mandelbaum’s blows hit their targets, as does his theoretical contention that the most important factor driving these policies was unprecedented relative power—the strong doing what they can once again, this time in a well-intentioned but clueless American mode. But since the author favors continuing “the American role as the chief custodian of the benign international order that . . .  emerged from the end of the Cold War,” it is not clear why the new era is truly distinctive, and the book would have benefited from less narration of familiar events and more discussion of the author’s preferred courses of action."

Grygiel and Mitchell make the case that the revisionist powers of China, Iran, and Russia have been probing the most exposed and vulnerable points in the United States’ system of alliances and that the next U.S. president will face much more dangerous challenges unless he or she takes strong action to reassert American power. Supporters of the Obama administration’s approach hope that a reasoned and conciliatory U.S. response will promote the emergence of a stable order that requires less U.S. effort to uphold. Grygiel and Mitchell counter that far from settling into a cooperative new order, those revisionist powers will choose escalation, requiring the United States to run greater risks and incur larger costs to defend the existing world system. At the moment, Obama’s supporters are on the defensive; if the trend of rising instability persists through January 2017, expect the next U.S. administration to look long and hard at the ideas put forward in this book."

But the 70 years between Chambers’ work with the Soviet spy apparatus and Hitchens’ support for the Bush administration saw such profound changes in the structure of U.S. politics that Oppenheimer’s attempt to place these six conversion stories in a common frame is less illuminating than one might hope. (The writer and critic Norman Podhoretz, the political theorist James Burnham, and Ronald Reagan are also included.) The left from which Chambers and Burnham seceded during the Cold War was an organized political force seeking a revolutionary transformation of American life. The left that Hitchens abandoned was less organized and less coherent. The difference between leaving the two was a bit like the difference between forsaking the Catholic Church and going home early from a dinner party. Podhoretz was the last to leave the Old Left, and Horowitz the first to leave the New Left; a closer focus on the similarities and differences between their experiences would have shed more light on the shifts in American political and intellectual life over the last generation."

From the beginning, the Progressive movement saw itself as a rival of nineteenth-century liberalism, not simply in the sphere of economics (replacing laissez faire with a more regulated economy) but also in the arena of individual liberties and rights. The advances of the late nineteenth century had led many intellectuals to believe that educated experts could make better decisions than the uninformed could make for themselves. Progressives aimed at social, economic, and natural engineering on a vast scale. Immigration restrictions, prohibition, and forced sterilization of “undesirable” members of the gene pool would reshape the lower classes; meanwhile, economic regulation would maintain fairness by limiting the power of corporate trusts. Leonard’s commendable book illuminates one phase in the centuries-long American struggle between the quest for liberal values and the impulse to build a godly commonwealth on the back of a strong state."

Her father, Samuel Ward III, was one of New York City’s most successful bankers, and young Julia was educated by some of the country’s leading scholars. A beauty and an heiress, she fell in love with and married Samuel Howe, a charismatic American hero of the Greek War of Independence, progressive political activist, and internationally famous pioneer in the education of the blind. Her books of poetry were met with wide acclaim, and her husband stood by her even as she scandalized the American artistic community in Rome with her unconventional lifestyle and published thinly veiled poetic accounts of their marital troubles. Her poem “The Battle Hymn of the Republic” became one of the great anthems of the American Civil War and made her a national celebrity as she traveled the country advocating women’s suffrage and other causes. Showalter casts Howe’s story as a feminist struggle against patriarchal oppression. This seems a bit overdone: Howe had her frustrations, but few people of any gender have had as much scope for their talents or received as much applause for their accomplishments as this authentically gifted, but also quite privileged, American artist."

Both are written by leading figures in the field: Kilcullen made his name as both a theorist and a practitioner of counterinsurgency, and Bergen has written extensively about radical Islamist groups. Kilcullen addresses the rise of the Islamic State (also known as ISIS), particularly in the Middle East, whereas Bergen concentrates on the phenomenon of Islamist radicalization inside the United States. Both subjects have taken on added urgency in the wake of recent events, notably the ISIS-related terrorist attacks last year in Paris and San Bernardino, California."

Until nuclear weapons are somehow eliminated, we have little choice but to rely on deterrence and a taboo (of uncertain strength) against their use. Meanwhile, governments must make every effort to limit the number of nuclear-armed states, reduce the number of nuclear weapons that exist, and narrow the options for their use."

At the time, the plant was the world’s only source of heavy water, a component of the uranium enrichment process. This was not the first or last attempt to deny Germany access to heavy water. In this authoritative account, Bascomb also describes how a few months before, there had been a calamitous mission undertaken by British commandos, which failed when their gliders crash-landed far from their target; the Germans later executed the surviving soldiers. In November 1943, nine months after the Norwegians’ successful mission, it became apparent that the Germans had started up production again, so the U.S. Army Air Forces bombed the plant. Finally, in 1944, there was a terminal act of sabotage, when two Norwegians sank a ferry carrying the last remaining containers of heavy water to Germany. Germany’s equivalent to the Manhattan Project might well have failed on its own, without these efforts, but it would have been too risky to assume as much. Bascomb offers a vivid and gripping narrative that conveys the heroism and dedication of the anti-Nazi operatives, especially in the face of severe weather conditions, and also delves into the ethics of resistance, which sometimes involves implicating or even killing innocent people."
42,Beyond the Tragedy in Global Fisheries,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2016-04-14/beyond-tragedy-global-fisheries,Beyond the Tragedy in Global Fisheries,"Climate change, a relatively recent concern, dominates contemporary discussions of shared resources and “the tragedy of the commons.” Webster’s comprehensive, although somewhat jargony, book reminds readers of another tragedy—the overexploitation of ocean fisheries—and explores attempts to prevent or overcome it, a battle that people have waged for centuries. Every commercial fishing firm wants to catch as many fish as it can. But without restraints, fisheries ultimately collapse, particularly as fishing technology advances. Webster documents and evaluates conservation efforts, which sometimes succeed but mostly fail, usually owing to the political clout of major commercial fishing concerns looking out for their short-term economic interests. This track record does not set a happy precedent for attempts to limit global emissions of greenhouse gases."
43,Have Bacteria Won?,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2016-04-14/have-bacteria-won,Have Bacteria Won?,"High-profile pandemics and the spread of drug-resistant microbes have fueled fears about humanity’s ability to contend with the scourge of viruses and bacteria. But Pennington answers the question posed by his title with a resounding no: the microbes have not “won.” He warns, however, that it would be an error to conclude that they have lost. Humans have made astounding progress during the past century in bringing tiny parasites under control, but the war against them—to use a metaphor the author dislikes—will continue indefinitely, thanks to their collective resilience. Some outbreaks are genuine, but many alleged microbial emergencies are mostly ginned up by the media, which find it expedient to misreport and exaggerate bacterial or viral threats, sometimes out of ignorance, sometimes willfully. The book offers brief but informative discussions of recent real and not-so-real pandemics."

Much rarer is the kind of careful analysis of the sources and consequences of great wealth that Freund offers in this book. She relies on Forbes’ annual list of billionaires and focuses on those who hail from developing countries. There were 705 developing-world billionaires in 2014, up from 102 in 2001. The vast majority of these ultrarich are self-made, rather than people who inherited their wealth. Most founded or managed new companies that grew rapidly in terms of sales and employment, thus contributing to the overall economic growth of the countries where they were established. But the emergence of billionaires has also contributed to the rise of income inequality in the countries of the developing world, which Freund views as a logical consequence of rapid economic growth and changing economic structures—even while, from a global point of view, inequality falls, as more and more people escape poverty or join the ranks of new middle classes."
45,Global Inequality: A New Approach for the Age of Globalization,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2016-04-14/global-inequality-new-approach-age-globalization,Global Inequality: A New Approach for the Age of Globalization,"Milanovic, a former World Bank official and an authority on global inequality, attributes the recent rise of inequality within the United States and other countries to technological advancement and globalization, two trends that he argues are impossible to disentangle. But those trends have also produced a sharp decline in overall global inequality since 1980, by permitting rapid growth in poor countries, most notably China, which has helped narrow the gap between the world’s haves and its have-nots. Milanovic expects that process to continue, unless China, India, and other populous Asian countries seriously falter. He believes that growing inequality within countries will not threaten capitalism as a system for allocating economic resources but will pose a serious threat to liberal democracy. As middle classes everywhere get squeezed, the United States will become even more plutocratic, and nativistic populism will become more mainstream in Europe—a process that is already under way, aided in no small part by the influx of migrants, a feature of globalization that is likely to only intensify."

The United States looms large in their stories: some of them had experience studying or working in the United States, others drew on U.S. venture capital, and most were inspired by successful American start-ups. Based on detailed interviews with the entrepreneurs and their colleagues, Bayrasli reveals significant institutional obstacles that stand in the way of starting and sustaining new businesses in emerging markets, even in countries that officially aspire to modernization, growth, and the creation of nonagricultural employment: politically supported barriers to entry, a shortage of skilled workers, licensing requirements that facilitate bribery—and, for those who don’t play along with the unwritten rules, outright extortion and unjustified threats of criminal indictment. But the stories in this book demonstrate that talent and perseverance can overcome even those formidable roadblocks. Reducing the barriers might unleash astounding economic performance."

Ramo is in the latter camp, and his bold new book is an attempt to sketch the contours of the new “age of networks” he sees aborning. A few centuries ago, in his telling, the Enlightenment and the scientific revolution gave birth to the modern world, with its capitalism, democracy, global trade, and industrial power. Today, the spread of networks and constant, ever-faster connections is creating a new kind of order with new sources of strength. Power is both more concentrated and more distributed than ever before, traditional assets become irrelevant almost overnight, and all that is solid melts into air—or, rather, into pulses of information. Individuals, firms, and nations that can appreciate and master the new order will flourish; those that can’t will flounder. Skeptics may find this all a bit overwrought and bewildering; Ramo would consider such responses the hallmark of those destined to be left behind."

Still, with an eye for vivid details, Khanna has nevertheless produced an engaging geopolitical travelogue, unearthing the Internet cables, energy pipelines, and electrical grids that link regions together more closely than ever before and allow people to lead increasingly connected lives. In his view, connectivity is transforming conflict between states into competition for access to the world’s infrastructure of networks and markets. A world of nation-states, he argues, is becoming a world of nodes and transit hubs: a “global network civilization.” And yet the actual stories of globalization in the book still revolve around big players such as China, India, Russia, the United States, and Europe. The influence of these traditional geopolitical powers might ebb and flow, but it is hardly disappearing. In that sense, the new, more connected world does not seem all that different from the old, less connected one."

But in closely examining the various ways in which sanctions affect the interests, resources, and strategies of different political groups, Jones finds that things don’t always turn out that way. In South Africa in the 1980s, an internationally enforced embargo ultimately fragmented the ruling bloc and empowered progressive political and business groups that pushed for an end to apartheid. In Iraq during the 1990s, Jones argues, sanctions seriously weakened Saddam Hussein’s ruling coalition, but his regime managed to hang on to power. In recent years in Myanmar (also known as Burma), sanctions actually strengthened the ruling bloc, at least for a time, as the regime found ways to push the costs onto nonstate groups. Given this mixed record, Jones finds it difficult to draw general conclusions. He speculates that countries with middle classes that enjoy some independence from the state are the mostly likely to respond to sanctions as intended. But Jones’ central message is that enthusiasm for sanctions should be tempered by an appreciation of their complex, unpredictable, and sometimes counterproductive effects. Past performance is no guarantee of future results."

The authoritarian governments of China and Russia are the best-known practitioners of modern-day statism, but in this masterful survey, Kurlantzick shows that a shift toward state capitalism is also occurring in major democratic developing countries, such as Argentina, Brazil, India, and Indonesia, where governments have taken controlling ownership stakes in many of the largest companies. As Kurlantzick demonstrates, this new state capitalism, unlike older versions, is generally compatible with outward-looking trade and investment policies. It can also help developing countries access globalized sectors such as telecommunications, banking, and energy. Kurlantzick’s analysis brings to mind Andrew Shonfield’s Modern Capitalism, the classic 1965 account of a shifting balance between public and private control in the postwar economies of Europe and the United States. Then, as now, governments sought to maintain stability while also taking advantage of opportunities in a rapidly evolving global capitalist system. Kurlantzick, however, sees slightly more ominous possibilities today, emphasizing the risk that countries will increasingly turn away from market-oriented models, embrace protectionism, and restrict political freedoms."

The great wave of democratization that spread across the developing world at the end of the Cold War has long since crested. Today, it is the undertow of dashed expectations that seems to define the fate of modern democracy: political gridlock, economic stagnation, increasing inequality, fraying social contracts, reactionary nationalism, and rising authoritarianism. In their illuminating collection, Diamond and Plattner have assembled leading experts who offer mostly grim assessments of the situation. Diamond, in his own contribution, sifts through the data and reports that the democratic world is in “recession,” sharing the stunning observation that during the past three decades, fully 24 percent of the world’s democracies have broken down. Some have been the victim of military coups, but more often, democracies have experienced a slow degradation of political rights and legal procedures through electoral fraud and the rise of authoritarian leaders. Robert Kagan emphasizes the importance of geopolitical leadership as a stabilizer and promoter of democracy. But such leadership is difficult to provide when the main leader—the United States—is itself so troubled. Francis Fukuyama points to the failure of new democracies to build functioning modern states, which is an essential precondition for high-quality governance. The only good news that the contributors offer is that authoritarian states remain unstable and incapable of mastering the long-term challenges of modernizing societies and economies."

First, Fontaine writes that the phrase Senatus Populusque Romanus, or “the Senate and the People of Rome,” was “an advertisement for the link between Rome’s citizens and its elected leaders.” The term did name two distinct and separate categories of people whose collaboration through Rome’s complex political institutions marked its form of government.

56,The Clean Energy Revolution,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2016-04-18/clean-energy-revolution,The Clean Energy Revolution,"As the UN Climate Change Conference in Paris came to a close in December 2015, foreign ministers from around the world raised their arms in triumph. Indeed, there was more to celebrate in Paris than at any prior climate summit. Before the conference, over 180 countries had submitted detailed plans to curb their greenhouse gas emissions. And after two weeks of intense negotiation, 195 countries agreed to submit new, stronger plans every five years."
57,The Age of Transparency,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/world/2016-04-18/age-transparency,The Age of Transparency,"Transparency has long been a rare commodity in international affairs. But today, the forces of technology are ushering in a new age of openness that would have been unthinkable just a few decades ago. Governments, journalists, and nongovernmental organ­izations (NGOs) can now harness a flood of open-source information, drawn from commercial surveillance satellites, drones, smartphones, and computers, to reveal hidden activities in contested areas—from Ukraine to Syria to the South China Sea."
58,The Fusion of Civilizations,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/world/fusion-civilizations,The Fusion of Civilizations,"The mood of much of the world is grim these days. Turmoil in the Middle East, causing hundreds of thousands of deaths and millions of refugees; random terrorist attacks across the globe; geopolitical tensions in eastern Europe and Asia; the end of the commodity supercycle; slowing growth in China; and economic stagnation in many countries—all have combined to feed a deep pessimism about the present and, worse, the future."
59,The Fed and the Great Recession,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2016-04-18/fed-and-great-recession,The Fed and the Great Recession,"Today, there is essentially one accepted narrative of the economic crisis that began in late 2007. Overly optimistic homebuyers and reckless lenders in the United States created a housing price bubble. Regulators were asleep at the switch. When the bubble inevitably popped, the government had to bail out the banks, and the United States suffered its deepest and longest slump since the 1930s. For anyone who has seen or read The Big Short, this story will be familiar."
60,The Fed’s Unconventional Monetary Policy,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/world/feds-unconventional-monetary-policy,The Fed’s Unconventional Monetary Policy,"Now, almost a decade after the Great Recession hit, the story of its origins and course has become familiar. It began in December 2007, soon after the U.S. housing bubble burst, triggering the widespread collapse of the U.S. financial system. Credit dried up, as banks lost confidence in the value of their assets and stopped lending to one another. Consumer spending plummeted. At first, the U.S. Federal Reserve tried to boost spending through traditional monetary policy, by reducing short-term interest rates. Yet this proved ineffective, even though short-term interest rates fell close to zero. The government then turned to fiscal stimulus, with Congress passing a package of tax cuts and spending increases in 2009, but this, too, proved ineffectual."
61,The Once and Future Superpower,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2016-04-13/once-and-future-superpower,The Once and Future Superpower,"After two and a half decades, is the United States’ run as the world’s sole superpower coming to an end? Many say yes, seeing a rising China ready to catch up to or even surpass the United States in the near future. By many measures, after all, China’s economy is on track to become the world’s biggest, and even if its growth slows, it will still outpace that of the United States for many years. Its coffers overflowing, Beijing has used its new wealth to attract friends, deter enemies, modernize its military, and aggressively assert sovereignty claims in its periphery. For many, therefore, the question is not whether China will become a superpower but just how soon."
62,America and the Global Economy,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2016-04-11/america-and-global-economy,America and the Global Economy,"When U.S. President Barack Obama joined other global leaders at the G-20 summit in Turkey in November 2015, the United States was in the final stages of a multiyear effort to secure the approval of a set of important reforms to the International Monetary Fund. The reforms, negotiated in 2010 with strong U.S. leadership, were designed to double the organization’s core financial resources to combat financial crises and to modernize its governance by increasing the voting shares of emerging-market economies while maintaining a decisive U.S. voice. But their implementation had been on hold for several years, awaiting approval from Congress. Christine Lagarde, the IMF’s managing director, spoke for many when she opened the meeting in Turkey by saying she prayed that the United States would approve the reforms by the end of the year. Obama responded with a mix of levity and seriousness. “You don’t have to pray, Christine,” he said. “It will get done.”"
63,Why Putin Took Crimea,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/ukraine/2016-04-18/why-russian-president-putin-took-crimea-from-ukraine,Why Putin Took Crimea,"Russian President Vladimir Putin’s seizure of the Crimean Peninsula from Ukraine in early 2014 was the most consequential decision of his 16 years in power. By annexing a neighboring country’s territory by force, Putin overturned in a single stroke the assumptions on which the post–Cold War European order had rested."
64,How Putin Silences Dissent,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/russia-fsu/2016-04-18/how-putin-silences-dissent,How Putin Silences Dissent,"In December 2015, the Russian antigraft activist Alexey Navalny released a documentary in which he exposed the corrupt business dealings of the children of Yuri Chaika, Russia’s prosecutor general—the top law enforcement official in the country. In the film, Navalny accuses Chaika’s son Artem of “continuously exploit[ing] the protection that his father, the prosecutor general of the Russian Federation, gives him to extort from and steal other people’s companies.” Artem owns a five-star hotel in Greece with his father’s deputy’s ex-wife, who, according to Navalny, maintains close business ties with the wives of violent gang members in southern Russia. The film includes scenes from the inauguration of the hotel, a grand celebration attended by Russian politicians, businessmen, and pop stars. The documentary also details Artem’s involvement in a predatory takeover of a Siberian shipping company in 2002; after speaking out against Artem, the company’s former manager was found hanged."
65,Putin’s Foreign Policy,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/russia-fsu/2016-04-18/putins-foreign-policy,Putin’s Foreign Policy,"In February, Moscow and Washington issued a joint statement announcing the terms of a “cessation of hostilities” in Syria—a truce agreed to by major world powers, regional players, and most of the participants in the Syrian civil war. Given the fierce mutual recriminations that have become typical of U.S.-Russian relations in recent years, the tone of the statement suggested a surprising degree of common cause. “The United States of America and the Russian Federation . . . [are] seeking to achieve a peaceful settlement of the Syrian crisis with full respect for the fundamental role of the United Nations,” the statement began. It went on to declare that the two countries are “fully determined to provide their strongest support to end the Syrian conflict.”"
66,The Revival of the Russian Military,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/russia-fsu/2016-04-18/revival-russian-military,The Revival of the Russian Military,"After the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Russian military rotted away. In one of the most dramatic campaigns of peacetime demilitarization in world history, from 1988 to 1994, Moscow’s armed forces shrank from five million to one million personnel. As the Kremlin’s defense expenditures plunged from around $246 billion in 1988 to $14 billion in 1994, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, the government withdrew some 700,000 servicemen from Afghanistan, Germany, Mongolia, and eastern Europe. So much had the prestige of the military profession evaporated during the 1990s that when the nuclear submarine Kursk sank in the Barents Sea in 2000, its captain was earning the equivalent of $200 per month."
67,Russia’s Constrained Economy,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/russia-fsu/2016-04-18/russias-constrained-economy,Russia’s Constrained Economy,"In recent years, many discussions of the Russian economy have opened with an old joke. In the mid-1990s, John Major, the British prime minister, asked Russian President Boris Yeltsin to characterize Russia’s economy in one word. “Good,” Yeltsin said. Major, seeking more detail, asked him to elaborate in two words. Yeltsin replied: “Not good.”"
68,Russian Politics Under Putin,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/russia-fsu/2016-04-18/russian-politics-under-putin,Russian Politics Under Putin,"Between 1996 and 2011, I served as a consultant to the Kremlin, advising Russian Presidents Boris Yeltsin, Vladimir Putin, and Dmitry Medvedev. And yet even I can hardly claim to understand the real mechanisms of power in today’s Russia. In the past few years, the country has reached a level of dysfunction that has pushed it to the brink, threatening its very existence. Ill-conceived military adventures, poor decision-making, and political skullduggery—sometimes of the lethal variety—have wreaked havoc on Russia’s economy and led to international isolation."
69,Russia’s Perpetual Geopolitics,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/ukraine/2016-04-18/russias-perpetual-geopolitics,Russia’s Perpetual Geopolitics,"For half a millennium, Russian foreign policy has been characterized by soaring ambitions that have exceeded the country’s capabilities. Beginning with the reign of Ivan the Terrible in the sixteenth century, Russia managed to expand at an average rate of 50 square miles per day for hundreds of years, eventually covering one-sixth of the earth’s landmass. By 1900, it was the world’s fourth- or fifth-largest industrial power and the largest agricultural producer in Europe. But its per capita GDP reached only 20 percent of the United Kingdom’s and 40 percent of Germany’s. Imperial Russia’s average life span at birth was just 30 years—higher than British India’s (23) but the same as Qing China’s and far below the United Kingdom’s (52), Japan’s (51), and Germany’s (49). Russian literacy in the early twentieth century remained below 33 percent—lower than that of Great Britain in the eighteenth century. These comparisons were all well known by the Russian political establishment, because its members traveled to Europe frequently and measured their country against the world’s leaders (something that is true today, as well)."
70,Making America Great Again,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/united-states/making-america-great-again,Making America Great Again,"At a debate among the Republican presidential candidates in March, U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas boiled down his campaign message to its essentials: “Here’s my philosophy. The less government, the more freedom. The fewer bureaucrats, the more prosperity. And there are bureaucrats in Washington right now who are killing jobs and I’ll tell you, I know who they are. I will find them and I will fire them.”"

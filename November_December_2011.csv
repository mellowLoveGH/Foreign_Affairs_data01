3,Israel's Bunker Mentality,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/middle-east/2011-11-01/israels-bunker-mentality,Israel’s Bunker Mentality,"For the Israeli right and its allies around the world, the greatest danger to Israel’s future is the unwillingness of Palestinians to make peace. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict does threaten Israel, but not, as the right would have it, because militant and even seemingly moderate Palestinians harbor plans to drive the Jews into the sea. Rather, the conflict threatens Israel because of the havoc it wreaks on the country’s internal politics. Since 1967, when Israel occupied the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, its presence in those territories has played a central role in structuring Israeli politics, transforming a country once brimming with optimism into an increasingly cynical, despondent, and illiberal place."

The key reason for this failure is the Palestinians’ refusal to recognize Israel as a Jewish state.

But that is what Alekperov, the president of Lukoil, the second largest of Russia’s ten key oil companies, has done. A full third of this lengthy book is devoted to the history of the industry from before Peter the Great’s reign through the nineteenth century, at a level of detail found in no other English-language publication. The discussion of the early years of Bolshevik rule through Lenin’s five-year plans is particularly rich and balanced, but Alekperov pays relatively little attention to the period stretching from the end of World War II to the fall of the Soviet Union. Unsurprisingly, he has general praise for present-day Russian energy policy and prospects. Still, this does not detract from the wealth of detail he provides, detail that will interest even the most informed student of the subject.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

But the effort remains largely unstudied, so Veit’s book fills a void. He argues that like previous state-building missions in the region, MONUC lacks the legitimacy and capacity to act alone. It has mostly avoided relying on the antidemocratic intermediaries, such as local chiefs and “big men,” that central authorities depended on in the past, but has failed to adequately replace them with local or international nongovernmental organizations. The resulting jumble of international organizations, warlords, nongovernmental organizations, and local civil-society actors has combined with the remnants of the Congolese state to fashion a highly dysfunctional form of governance that fails to deliver peace and well-being to a long-suffering population. It is a persuasive analysis, but the absence of a policy prescription disappoints.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

Ryan focuses on Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire, the two countries that together produce half the world’s cocoa output. Large numbers of West Africans rely on cocoa for their livelihoods, she shows, and politicians have long used revenues tied to cocoa exports to retain their holds on power. Reformers have expressed concern about industry practices, and Ryan ably discusses such issues as child labor on cocoa farms and the debates around free trade. She argues that an even greater source of concern is the long-term environmental sustainability of current approaches to cocoa production, and she advances the notion that chocolate prices might spike in the not-too-distant future.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

One of the great merits of Denov’s book on the civil war in Sierra Leone is her refusal to either mythologize or demonize that war’s child soldiers as she meticulously chronicles their abduction by rebels (almost invariably the method of recruitment), their experiences during the war, and their attempts to reintegrate into society after the conflict ended in 2002. Through interviews with them, Denov shows how some were horrified by the violence but reveled in the power over civilians their guns afforded them. She criticizes the existing literature for focusing almost entirely on male child soldiers, even though a large proportion are girls, many of whom have been victims of systematic sexual violence at the hands of fellow soldiers and commanders. She reports that female child soldiers also remain largely ignored by donor-funded disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration programs."
9,Warfare in Independent Africa,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2011-11-01/warfare-independent-africa,Warfare in Independent Africa,"This accessible survey of African wars in the postcolonial era rightly emphasizes internal conflicts, which have caused more violence in the region than interstate wars. Reno tracks the changing motivations of domestic rebellions, from anticolonial movements to reformist rebels who sought to build stronger state structures after independence, to contemporary warlords, such as those in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Sierra Leone, who fight over resources but lack a programmatic agenda. Reno ends the book with a somewhat underdeveloped argument, suggesting that the kind of reformist rebellions led by Yoweri Museveni in Uganda and Paul Kagame in Rwanda are less likely today because of the declining influence of Marxist ideas and the increasing weakness of state structures. The next generation of rebels, he argues, are more likely to be motivated by narrower, more instrumental objectives and will be less keen to establish political order.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

Sixty-nine protesters died, and the massacre became an iconic moment in the struggle against apartheid. Relying on fascinating archival testimonies of demonstrators -- but little from the police -- Lodge explains that the protests had been organized by the Pan-Africanist Congress, which was then at the peak of its influence in the anti-apartheid movement. The PAC was slowly displaced by its rival, the better-organized African National Congress, led by Nelson Mandela. Lodge argues convincingly that the major effect of the Sharpeville massacre was international. It galvanized an international civil-society coalition against the white minority government in South Africa, leading directly to the regime’s first major diplomatic defeat: its exclusion from the British Commonwealth in 1961. Yet Lodge also observes that in the short term, the massacre consolidated minority rule. The South African government used the threat of black violence to bolster its legitimacy with whites and justify its repressive practices.

Myanmar is historically and culturally close to India, but trade between the two countries is surprisingly limited and their political ties are thin. By contrast, the boom in China’s Yunnan Province has boosted Myanmar’s economy and brought the country closer to China, which covets a pathway to the Bay of Bengal, an important shipping hub. According to Thant, the military regime in Myanmar has a firm grip on most of the country, and sanctions have served only to deprive Western democracies of any influence. In his view, Myanmar’s future is roads, railways, pipelines, and hydropower transmission lines, accompanied by a consumer revolution that will make the country “China’s California.”Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."
12,Legitimacy Crisis in Thailand,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2011-11-01/legitimacy-crisis-thailand,Legitimacy Crisis in Thailand,"The Thailand- and Singapore-based contributors to this volume diagnose what ails Thailand with clinical clarity. According to Michael Montesano, two significant structural flaws are the growth of the income gap since the 1997–98 Asian financial crisis and an unresponsive, overcentralized local administrative system. Those factors -- along with an excessively powerful monarchy and the rise of a Thai version of Peronism centered around former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra -- led directly to the current crisis, which began with a 2006 military coup that drove Thaksin from power and climaxed with deadly riots in Bangkok in 2010. Rural dissatisfaction fed Thaksin’s Red Shirt movement; vested interests supported the countervailing, pro-monarchy Yellow Shirt movement, motivated by an atavistic nationalist fervor. The courts, the media, and the military were all drawn into the battle. The crisis is now entering its sixth year, with all the main political parties delegitimized and the king in poor health.

13,Water: Asia’s New Battleground,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2011-11-01/water-asias-new-battleground,Water: Asia’s New Battleground,"Owing to growing populations, richer lifestyles, and government mismanagement, water is desperately scarce in Asia (a region defined in this book as including much of the Middle East). Climate change will threaten supply more in Asia than anywhere else, potentially curbing the region’s economic growth. Complicating matters further, much of the region’s water comes from contested areas. Tibet, for example, is the biggest regional source, supplying water to 11 countries. Detailing a number of ecological and economic risks, as well as threats to Tibetan spiritual and cultural life, Chellaney criticizes plans China reportedly has to divert water from and build hydroelectric dams on the upper reaches of the Brahmaputra River, which runs into India and Bangladesh. Ranging widely across the region, this forcefully written study warns of a growing risk of interstate conflicts over water. The only way to avoid such outcomes, Chellaney argues, is to adopt a cooperative, rule-based approach to water management -- a hard sell for sovereign states.

Mullaney has discovered the archives of the Yunnan office of the Ethnic Classification Project and has interviewed some of its surviving members, allowing him to reflect on modern state making and identity creation. Yunnan is the southwestern province where almost half the classified minority groups reside. Ironically, the young communist ethnologists dispatched by Beijing in 1954 to “scientifically” classify the groups used a linguistics-based system that, unbeknownst to them, was designed in the early twentieth century by an officer in the “imperialist” British army. In the process, they ended up creating some groups that had never actually existed. But in the decades since, the state has taught the minorities to accept the official categories, and today they are socially real.

Not unlike Brazil and France, China protects big, well-connected firms -- but in China, the state directly owns those companies. China is so big that the central government’s efforts to consolidate enterprises in some sectors (including the automobile industry) have been frustrated by powerful provincial governments, which has not happened in dirigiste economies with smaller populations. As Margaret Pearson puts it in her contribution, China’s adoption of capitalism has been “superbly ambivalent.” China is capitalist but does not have what Americans would call a free-market system. In all, China has more in common with large developing countries, such as Brazil and Indonesia, than with states in any other category, which suggests that the China miracle may face similar limits to growth."

He is interested in both the reasoning of judges and the behavior of perpetrators and victims. It turns out that many Japanese judges hold beliefs that would be out of the mainstream in the United States: that paying for sex is akin to paying for health treatments such as massage therapy, that intercourse normally involves the use of force, that a man should be able to decide single-handedly whether his child is to be aborted, and that love is a dark emotion that can sometimes excuse murder. The people who appear before the courts seem to suffer from an epidemic of sexual isolation, loveless marriages, stalking, murder, and suicide. It is hard to be sure what those extreme cases say about Japanese society in general. But West convincingly links them to broader social problems, such as low birthrates and rising divorce rates.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

But few citizens actually use the courts, and those who do are often dissatisfied with the outcome. Judges, who are civil servants, are graded on a point system that motivates them to check pending decisions in advance with higher courts, lest they lose points for making mistakes. Citizens seeking justice often take their cases to the media, the Internet, and the street, and courts often respond to such pressure with decisions favoring those litigants who have pushed the hardest. Overseeing the entire court system is the Supreme People’s Court, which maintains a good deal of independence because its work is regarded as too technical for either the ruling party or the legislature to manage. Yet the highest court instructs lower-court judges that their primary responsibility is to support social stability, rather than defend citizen rights. It has also resisted attempts by pioneering lawyers to use the constitution to overrule government regulations. It is no surprise, then, that Chinese citizens remain unconvinced that they can find justice in court.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

More comprehensive than most such works, the book includes the often overlooked Central Asian states and Somalia but gives short shrift to Syria, Sudan, and Yemen and ignores Lebanon altogether. Many of the chapters address the tension between the urge to promote democracy and the necessity of dealing with existing regimes. Although most of these analyses of U.S. Middle East policy were apparently completed before the onset of the revolutions now shaking the Arab world, they are still useful in understanding what changed, and what did not, during the period of transition from the final years of the Bush administration to the beginning of the Obama era. Taken together, they suggest that by avoiding George W. Bush’s unilateralist aggressiveness, Obama has implemented a conservative foreign policy that has muted democracy promotion and worked within the existing system.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

Rock the Casbah continues in that tradition, opening with a chapter on the beginnings of the Arab Spring in Tunisia and Egypt and then tracing the origins of what Wright dubs a “counter-jihad,” in which Muslims have turned their backs on the excesses of both al Qaeda and the theocrats in Iran. Wright also takes on subjects that seldom figure in high politics -- hip-hop, standup comedians, and poetry, as well as the new technology that produces what she calls “satellite sheikhs and YouTube imams.” She emphasizes throughout the important role of Muslim youth, who compose more than half the region’s population and even higher proportions in several Muslim-majority countries. Although not overlooking setbacks -- such as the quickly squelched movement protesting the 2009 Iranian presidential election and the stalled reform movements in Bahrain and Yemen -- Wright’s admittedly “counter-intuitive” interpretation sees the promise of progress toward a democratic modernity in the Muslim world. U.S. policies addressing these ongoing changes, she concludes, have been behind the curve."

In this portrait of Pakistan, the country’s heavy-handed military and its elusive Inter-Services Intelligence agency loom large, as does a tendency throughout society to see the outside world in terms of crude conspiracy theories. The dysfunction is so debilitating that at one point, Constable suggests Pakistan should be seen not as a “failed state” but as a “fake state.”"

Ben-Ami begins with the story of his family’s roots in militant, expansionist Zionism. But as a young man, his own concern for Israel was overshadowed by his active involvement in U.S. domestic politics. Only later, while living in Israel and coming into contact with Palestinians, did he have an epiphany: Israel needed a policy of actively seeking peace with the Palestinians, and Americans needed to be not just reflexively pro-Israel but pro-peace as well. To achieve this goal, Ben-Ami founded the lobbying organization J Street in 2008. His account of the group’s efforts to date is enriched by his knowledge of how lobbies fit into the U.S. political system."

Hunt spent much of her four years as U.S. President Bill Clinton’s ambassador to Austria attempting to intercede in the conflict. In hindsight, she writes, “wretched mistakes were made by well-intentioned people who were distracted, lost their nerve, and misjudged actors and events.” Part apology, part cri de coeur, her book culminates in a catalog of specific lessons applicable to much more than the Bosnian experience.

Ivan the Terrible and Peter the Great, however, echo in Russian society less as heroes than as avatars, reflecting the outer limits of Russia’s traumas. Platt treats the way Russian historians, writers, and artists since the early nineteenth century have tried to come to terms with the legacy of these overpowering figures -- sometimes merging Peter’s “greatness” and Ivan’s “terror” into a single, reinforcing unity and sometimes treating those qualities as polar opposites. Their struggle, as Platt traces it -- from Nikolai Karamzin’s seminal early-nineteenth-century history of Russia, through Ilya Repin’s portrait of a horror-stricken Ivan holding the son he just murdered, to Stalin’s remaking of the two tsars into founders of Russian great power, to the use of Peter’s image to sell chocolates, cigarettes, and vodka in the 1990s -- reflects the ambivalent, at times tortured, standing Ivan and Peter have in the country’s collective identity.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

In still rarer cases, one sets down the book and is moved by the spirit and character of its author. This is one such book. Michnik, a prominent editor and a key figure in Poland’s pre-1989 democratic opposition, writes with grace and simplicity. With a stunning, gentle steeliness, he rues developments in Poland since the 1989 revolution, “when the fight for freedom ended and the time of divisions and power struggles began.” His principal disgust is reserved for the “mudslingers” -- on the right and the left, at home and among the diaspora -- who hurl accusations against those, such as the dissident poet Czeslaw Milosz and the Solidarity co-founder Lech Walesa, whose courage and achievements they seek to diminish. What distinguishes Michnik is his passion for dialogue, his abhorrence of revenge, and his willingness to find worth in his political adversaries.

25,The Politics of Inequality in Russia,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2011-11-01/politics-inequality-russia,The Politics of Inequality in Russia,"Convergence theory, which imagined that the two Cold War superpowers were growing more alike in actions and character, never held water. But in one important respect, Russia and the United States have converged in the post–Cold War period: among advanced countries, the two are in a class by themselves when it comes to economic inequality. After comparing the levels of income inequality among Russia’s regions, Remington concludes that the political dynamic in each is an important factor in determining economic disparities. Surprisingly, the more democratic a region is, the greater its inequality. Yet at the same time, more democratic regions also enjoy stronger economic growth and lower poverty rates. Remington sees all three outcomes as the result of the greater autonomy, shared sacrifice, and opportunities for partnerships that exist in more pluralistic settings. The vast literature on democracy and economic inequality, well sampled by Remington, reveals a complex relationship. Democracy’s effect on inequality remains ambiguous. The damaging impact of inequality on democracy, however, does not. Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

But even the nightmare of totalitarianism can be complex, and Clark traces the efforts of regime-blessed Soviet cultural figures of the 1930s to foster a “transnational fraternity” with leftist European artists and intellectuals, comrades-in-arms against fascism who were enamored of Marx and fascinated by the Soviet “experiment.” It was something of a two-way street, with Stalin, very much a hands-on impresario, allowing the import of Western film and literature, as long as the cumulative effect was to give his political vision imperial reach. As a result, for much of the decade, the exchange of ideas about theater, film, literature, journalism, and architecture was richer and more intense than one might have thought. As Clark demonstrates in this masterful tour of trends in Soviet culture and their echoes in Europe, the modified version of universalism tolerated by Stalin placed the Soviet Union at its center, and at the Soviet Union’s center stood Moscow -- the site and symbol of centralized Soviet power.

The Chinese are investing primarily in natural resource extraction and flooding Latin American markets with cheap industrial goods, thus shifting bilateral trade balances in China’s favor. Meanwhile, Latin American manufacturers are suffering, and the region’s economies are becoming overly dependent on commodity exports. Strong chapters on Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, and Venezuela survey the disjointed reactions of local industries to the Chinese onslaught and detail how bureaucratic politics in each country have prevented Latin American governments from helping the private sector deal with the challenge. Paradoxically, the shared Sino-Latin preference for state-directed economies, despite suggesting ideological convergence, can generate clashes between competing economic nationalisms. All the more urgent, the editors persuasively argue, is the need for intraregional dialogues on industrial strategies, environmental strategies, and financial transparency.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

She prefers U.S. policies of engagement and dialogue, although she recognizes that neither conciliation nor confrontation has produced great breakthroughs, faulting both Castro and his enemies in the hard-line exile community for the failure of attempts at rapprochement. Pérez-Stable correctly emphasizes the poor performance of the Cuban economy and holds out some modest hope that Raúl Castro, now in power, will balance political and economic goals more effectively than his older brother did. Accompanying the main text of the book is a superb essay by the Mexican scholar Ana Covarrubias examining the falling-out between the Castro regime and Mexico, which was once socialist Cuba’s most loyal ally in the Western Hemisphere. Whereas Cuba stuck with its one-party socialism, Mexico became more democratic and capitalist, and Mexican business executives finally tired of Cuba’s arbitrary business practices. Unfortunately, the book lacks a solid theory of international relations or a fully delineated ideological perspective that would lend more clarity to its detailed narrative.

U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton recently launched the International Diaspora Engagement Alliance, encouraging immigrants living in the United States to connect with their homelands. Meanwhile, the Mexican Ministry of Foreign Affairs has dropped its traditional passivity and begun engaging Mexican American communities throughout the United States. Delano well describes how the Mexican government has shifted from a powerless “non-intervention” posture to a more assertive “sí, se puede” (“yes, we can”) strategy, whereby diplomats regularly meet with Mexican American leaders and, what is more controversial, encourage Mexican Americans to access social services funded by U.S. taxpayers. Acting more cautiously, Mexico has not encouraged its diaspora to lobby on behalf of the country’s foreign policy goals, fearing a nationalist backlash within the United States. Delano’s sophisticated analysis of Mexico’s pro-diaspora programs makes for important reading, as it reveals not only major shifts in U.S.-Mexican relations but also the worldwide crumbling of traditional notions of national sovereignty."

Others have argued that U.S. diplomats have, in fact, repeatedly sought to engage Brazil, only to be rebuffed by a foreign ministry that harbors an essentially competitive view of the relationship. The report does gently chastise Brazil for its trade protectionism and its soft-pedaling on international human rights. But it generally assumes that U.S. and Brazilian interests overlap and urges the United States to welcome and even promote Brazil’s rise."

The United States, in particular, has fortified its border rather than expand on the North American Free Trade Agreement. Undeterred, Pastor presses his case with intelligence and good humor, marshaling data to demonstrate that all three nations would be better off adopting cooperative solutions to common problems. Public opinion polls suggest that the citizens of Canada, Mexico, and the United States are ready for greater regional cooperation. To deflect “sovereignty-zealots” and other myopic opponents of broader integration, Pastor calls on leaders to articulate a hopeful vision of integration while making practical progress on immediate problems. His book constitutes a brave master plan, a bright vision to challenge and enlighten future generations."

In a period when other underdeveloped regions, especially Asia, were experiencing steady economic growth, Africa as a whole saw its living standards plummet. Nearly all Africans lived under dictatorships, and millions suffered through brutal civil wars. Then, in the 1990s, the HIV/AIDS epidemic exploded, slashing life expectancy and heightening the sense that the region had reached rock bottom. It was no surprise when an intellectual cottage industry of Afro-pessimists emerged, churning out a stream of plausible-sounding explanations for Africa's stunning decline. The verdict was simple: Africa equaled failure."
34,Why We Still Need Nuclear Power,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/world/why-we-still-need-nuclear-power,Why We Still Need Nuclear Power,"In the years following the major accidents at Three Mile Island in 1979 and Chernobyl in 1986, nuclear power fell out of favor, and some countries applied the brakes to their nuclear programs. In the last decade, however, it began experiencing something of a renaissance. Concerns about climate change and air pollution, as well as growing demand for electricity, led many governments to reconsider their aversion to nuclear power, which emits little carbon dioxide and had built up an impressive safety and reliability record. Some countries reversed their phaseouts of nuclear power, some extended the lifetimes of existing reactors, and many developed plans for new ones. Today, roughly 60 nuclear plants are under construction worldwide, which will add about 60,000 megawatts of generating capacity -- equivalent to a sixth of the world's current nuclear power capacity."

In Libya, advocates of intervention argued, U.S. President Barack Obama had found the formula for success: broad regional and international support, genuine burden sharing with allies, and a capable local fighting force to wage the war on the ground. Some even heralded the intervention as a sign of an emerging Obama doctrine."

This sort of political system allows for the contestation of power among different social groups, but with so many violations of electoral fairness and so little regard for liberal norms that it cannot be called a true democracy. From Russia to Peru, Cambodia to Cameroon, such regimes are now located in almost every region of the world, and how they develop will determine the shape of the twenty-first century."

This past spring and summer, it hosted a series of high-profile summits, including for the Overseas Private Investment Corporation in May, the World Economic Forum on East Asia the same month, and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in July. With each event, Indonesia received broad praise for its leadership and achievements. This coming-out party will culminate in November, when the country hosts the East Asia Summit, which U.S. President Barack Obama and world leaders from 17 other countries will attend. As attention turns to Indonesia, the time is ripe to assess whether Jakarta can live up to all the hype."

Yet anyone who has lived there knows that Italians, like people everywhere, are materialists at heart. The desire to consume spurs the crassness and corruption, as well as the creativity, that are typically Italian. Despite its reputation for bureaucratic incompetence and peripheral poverty, Italy is one of the world’s great economic success stories, rising from postwar penury to become a great industrial powerhouse. Scarpellini observes that it was Italian, rather than American or French, craftsmanship that truly democratized luxury, spawning such brands as Armani, Ferragamo, and Gaggia. Yet many Italians, glued to television sets and shopping in supermarkets, have sunk to the cultural lowest common denominator. This book’s heavy academic prose and plainly descriptive style do not quite capture the paradoxical coexistence of beauty and ugliness that is modern Italy. But Material Nation nonetheless gives readers a fresh perspective on this endlessly fascinating country."

Yet the chapters on individual countries are insightful. They demonstrate that major Western powers have divergent threat perceptions and priorities. Of course, since the end of the Cold War, almost every book on NATO has made that observation. Yet all of them also conclude, as does this book, that there is no viable alternative to cooperation within NATO -- a fact made evident by the relative success of the organization’s intervention in Libya. To paraphrase Winston Churchill on democracy, NATO is the worst form of transatlantic military cooperation, except for all the others.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

The most successful realization of this principle is the European Convention on Human Rights. Founded in 1950, this international legal regime can overturn national laws if they violate regionally recognized human rights standards. Although governments and domestic courts retain considerable autonomy in deciding precisely how to implement the convention, their overall record of compliance is good. Among the practices it has reformed are the United Kingdom’s treatment of gays in the military, judicial procedures in Italy, and the adjudication of children’s rights in Belgium. In the best single history of this remarkable system, Bates describes its evolution from a bulwark against totalitarianism to a framework designed to encourage reform and block extreme acts of government malfeasance -- and, in recent years, to a tool for improving (and, to some extent, homogenizing) national human rights enforcement.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

Why do the citizens of Belgium, Germany, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom seem more resistant to nationalist appeals than their counterparts in France, Italy, and the Netherlands? Analysts have suggested a number of variables, including electoral rules, immigration levels, and the ability of certain right-wing parties to craft neoliberal economic appeals. Art’s book concentrates on another factor: the ability of the parties to recruit and retain leaders and members who are reassuringly educated, experienced, and moderate. For this, they rely on long-standing political subcultures, built on historical memories and prevailing social norms. The rigor of Art’s analysis may be open to debate, but his book is a useful reminder of the tremendous diversity in how western European societies face modern political challenges.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

Its subtle, deceptively straightforward conclusions are firmly grounded in judiciously selected facts and a vast secondary literature. The League of Nations was weak, but hardly responsible for war: in the mid-1930s, no international institution could have contained the intense pressures of economic depression and dictatorship. Adolf Hitler was a single-minded gambler who calculated his chances precisely, launching a risky attack in the hope of exploiting a window of opportunity before his more powerful enemies rearmed. Democratic societies were split by deep partisan and social divisions that impeded a more timely response to the threat. Hitler, Joseph Stalin, and the West all opportunistically sought to buy time before the inevitable conflict. (Among those efforts, the Nazi-Soviet pact stands out primarily because it was more successful than others, at least temporarily.) This book is destined to become the standard reference on this period."

Brookhiser clearly shares many of the criticisms historians have long made of Madison’s fumbling leadership in the White House -- blaming Madison, for example, for the feckless trade embargo enacted during the Jefferson administration, in which Madison served as secretary of state. But for Madison the constitutionalist and Madison the party manager, Brookhiser has nothing but praise. In particular, he credits Madison with understanding that factions and parties were a positive force in a young democracy.

Our Fight to Save America From Washington,"“Oh . . . that mine adversary had written a book,” cries Job. Rick Perry, the Texas governor and Republican presidential hopeful, has done exactly that, and his current Republican and potential Democratic opponents are mining it for ammunition. They will find some: Perry returns repeatedly to third-rail issues, such as Social Security and Medicare, and charged terms, such as “Ponzi scheme” and “unconstitutional,” litter the text. As a statement of political philosophy, the book could not be clearer -- or more welcome to supporters of the Tea Party movement. Perry believes that the neglect of the Tenth Amendment (which he interprets as barring Congress from action except on the limited subjects enumerated in the Constitution) has allowed Washington to get out of control. A Perry administration would be the first U.S. presidency since the nineteenth century to focus on reducing federal power and returning major responsibilities to the states. In foreign policy, Perry’s prescriptions are more muscular; he is a Jacksonian, rather than a Jeffersonian like Ron Paul. For a politician’s book, Fed Up! is unusually candid. Time will tell whether that helps or hurts Perry, as the long campaign grinds on."

Formidably well grounded in American political and intellectual history, and brandishing great sheaves of public opinion studies, Dawson disagrees with this hopeful consensus. In particular, he shows that African American and white communities often evaluate the same events in different ways. Ideas considered respectable and interesting, if not uncontroversial, among blacks often seem extreme and eccentric to whites. Although most black clergy, for example, disagree with the Afrocentric theology of Obama’s former minister, the now-infamous Jeremiah Wright, they see his views as part of a range of discourse that makes significant contributions to black intellectual and spiritual life. Blacks and whites viewed Hurricane Katrina differently, Dawson shows, with many blacks believing that racism explained the failed government response to the catastrophe and whites less willing to interpret it that way. Although Obama’s election made both blacks and whites more optimistic about the future of race relations, Dawson argues convincingly that the road to a truly postracial society remains arduous and long.

Class Warfare is a gripping account of the fierce combat between reformers and their opponents -- principally the teachers’ unions. Although the narrative sometimes loses its thread, Brill generally does a remarkable job of weaving the lives and experiences of students, teachers, and officials into a coherent story. The distance between the education reformers and the business-as-usual unions and bureaucracies that run the public schools disturbs Brill -- as it should. The charter school movement and the Teach for America program both rely heavily on young, idealistic teachers who often do extraordinary work for a few years but then burn out. The bureaucracies and the career public school teachers are usually less impressive, but they are in it for the long haul. Neither group alone can consistently deliver strong results for the majority of children over the long term. But the two approaches to education are so different that it is hard to get lifers and drop-ins to collaborate. Brill does not solve this dilemma, but he gives readers a clear view of the evolving relationship between the two forces."

According to Morgenson and Rosner, during the 1990s and the early years of this century, Fannie Mae’s greedy chair and the rapacious mortgage industry cynically manipulated public opinion and Congress, representing steps to ease credit requirements and create complex (and profitable) financial securities as high-minded efforts to bring homeownership within reach of the poor and minorities. The authors allege that an alliance between Wall Street and community groups such as ACORN -- mediated by Fannie Mae and blessed by Congress -- was responsible for both the real estate bubble and the financial crisis. The GOP can only hope voters buy this controversial thesis, as it makes the financial crash an almost all-Democratic affair. In truth, the full story is more complex. But for readers looking for an introduction to the meltdown, Reckless Endangerment is a good place to begin."

When progress could not be measured by territorial gains, there was a temptation to show that U.S. forces were inflicting unbearable losses on the enemy. A focus on winning hearts and minds produced a different set of problems. How could an invading army measure whether civilians felt secure and were not alienated? In this meticulous study, Daddis reviews the U.S. Army’s search for a winning strategy in Vietnam and its attempts to evaluate its performance. Counterinsurgency operations rely on political effects that are intrinsically hard to measure. As Daddis notes, the search for numerical formulas was a poor substitute for a deep understanding of the operational and strategic environment. Yet perhaps the greatest challenge was political, rather than methodological: once one of the military’s main objectives became convincing an increasingly doubtful American public that victory was possible, could any metric avoid being distorted?

The resources that had gone into the Manhattan Project meant that the weapons were bound to be used when they were ready, especially by an administration determined to explore all means to bring the war with Japan to a speedy end. It became controversial only after the war, as a result of claims, made most notably by the historian Gar Alperovitz, that President Harry Truman and his advisers knew the bombing was unnecessary. Miscamble skewers Alperovitz’s argument, countering that there was no reason to suppose that Japan was close to surrender prior to the bombing, that the bombing turned the debate in Tokyo in favor of surrender, and that the grim calculus of war suggested that if the atom bombs had not been used, many more would have died than were killed in Hiroshima and Nagasaki.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

The task fell to him because other senior Pentagon officials were preoccupied with planning for the imminent war in Iraq and were losing interest in Afghanistan. The main purpose of the book is to demonstrate the dire consequences of that neglect and how it prevented grand policies from becoming practical actions. Zakheim traces the current travails in Afghanistan to a failure to convert the military successes of late 2001 into political gains that would aid the larger goal of nation building. He also conveys the daily frustrations of trying to make the U.S. policymaking system work sensibly. Zakheim was part of a group of early advisers to presidential candidate George W. Bush -- the “Vulcans” alluded to in the title. His memoir nonetheless offers a measured portrayal of the Bush administration’s failings and of the personal clashes behind the debates over policy.

As he moves into more recent years, the book loses focus, becoming more assertive and less analytic -- a victim, perhaps, of recent developments whose impact on global jihadism is difficult to predict, namely, the Arab Spring and the killing of Osama bin Laden. Gerges’ main goal is to refute the mainstream “terrorism narrative” that has shaped U.S. policy since 9/11. An exaggerated threat of terrorism has led the United States to engage in disproportionate and inappropriate responses, a tendency Gerges sees continuing with President Barack Obama. The al Qaeda threat undoubtedly lends itself to overblown rhetoric in Washington. But Gerges’ core thesis, that the group is in decline, is closer to the mainstream view than he acknowledges."

In recent decades, Chinese and Indian overseas diasporas have played a crucial role in generating rapid growth in their home countries, as their members have created businesses and opened foreign marketing channels. To be sure, international migration also has a dark side, in the form of criminal organizations and terrorist networks that exploit open borders. But Guest argues that immigration is an especially important source of vitality for the United States, which does a remarkably good job of providing a hospitable and productive home for immigrants and their children, compared with other developed countries. In Guest’s judgment, this receptiveness will assure that the United States remains number one in the world economy -- unless thoughtlessly more restrictive immigration policies take hold."

Climate change resulting from human activity is only one threat to coasts and oceans, and not the most imminent one. Massive waste disposal and overfishing have altered marine ecosystems beyond easy repair. Hinrichsen’s book also offers some surprising details about the sources and extent of marine pollution: for example, the amount of oil released into the oceans has been declining for several decades, despite a rise in world oil consumption and a sharp rise in offshore production. Nonetheless, national and international attempts to relieve these pressures have lagged way behind the problems. For instance, a protocol to control land-based pollution of the Mediterranean came into force only in 2008, 32 years after European states signed a treaty intended to protect that crucial body of water.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

Most people’s firsthand experience with corruption usually involves individual government officials or courts, and those interactions are the most frequently studied aspect of corruption. Yadav believes that most studies of corruption have seriously neglected the role of elected legislatures. She argues that legislative procedures strongly influence the extent of corruption, particularly through lobbying by business groups. Her analysis reveals that when a legislature is organized around political parties that can set the policy agenda, determine amendments to legislation, and discipline party members who step out of line, there is significantly more corruption than when parties are weaker and legislators are more independent. This careful empirical work focuses in detail on Brazil and India -- large, complex countries with federal structures. But it also draws on evidence from 62 other democracies in the developing world. Yadav finds that contested elections do not eliminate legislative corruption in the form of financial payments made to parties and politicians by business groups to assure policy outcomes favorable to their interests. On the contrary, costly elections create more opportunities for corruption.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

The book recounts past international financial crises, including the most recent one, and tracks the evolution of thinking about how to respond to them, especially since the debt crisis of the 1980s. The 2008 financial crisis, Elson argues, revealed the international financial system’s woeful inability to anticipate breakdowns and minimize their damage.

His argument is straightforward: the philosophical underpinnings of the United Kingdom’s Industrial Revolution emphasized the need for freedom of action from feudal restraints on commerce and, eventually, on political decision-making. Those beliefs became predominant in Europe and North America by 1914, but unfettered capitalism left too many people behind. Marxism, communism, fascism, and non-Marxist social democracy all emerged in reaction to the resulting inequality, producing the great battles of the twentieth century, both within and between countries. By 2000, fascism and communism had failed, and capitalism -- tempered by government provision of education, health care, and a social safety net -- had won. The collective challenges of the twenty-first century, such as the proliferation of nuclear weapons and climate change, call for an age of fraternity.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

In the last half century, as democracy has spread around the world, empirical and theoretical inquiry into its sources and prospects has rapidly expanded into a vibrant scholarly field. This volume is an engaging survey of what is known and not known about the causes and consequences of democratization. Theories about this process have evolved, from an early emphasis on the long-term impersonal forces of modernization and economic development to a later focus on leadership, civil society, and the breakdown of authoritarianism. The “third wave” of democratization, which began in the late 1970s, made scholars look more closely at the international diffusion of democratic movements and impulses. More recently, the troubles encountered by some new democracies have drawn attention to the social and economic sources of crisis. Three main lessons have emerged: there is no single path to democratization, the relationship between economic development and democracy is complicated, and a supportive international environment can help, but not ensure, democratic breakthroughs.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

This superb book provides an important corrective to that flawed view. Patrick takes a close look at the alleged linkages between weak states and various global threats -- transnational crime and terrorism, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, energy insecurity, and infectious diseases. In each instance, Patrick finds that the connections are complicated and contingent. The weakness of states, as such, is not the problem. For example, Patrick argues that functioning but corrupt states, such as Pakistan, actually provide more congenial bases of operation for terrorists than do collapsed and lawless states. Yet Patrick does not turn the conventional wisdom completely on its head. The case studies do find that corruption, economic distress, a weak rule of law, and poor security provide enabling conditions for transnational threats. Patrick’s message to policymakers is not that they should become sanguine about weak and fragile states but that they should avoid false solutions and simplistic doctrines.

Building on this observation, this book argues that war in general is on the decline. “More wars are ending than beginning, once ended they are less likely to restart, and the remaining wars are more localized than in the past,” Goldstein writes. This good news, he contends, is a result of the international community “doing something right” in trying to tame war. Following the UN’s lead, peacekeepers, diplomats, aid agencies, and international organizations routinely intervene in troubled countries. The book narrates a number of UN-sponsored efforts to deal with various armed conflicts -- from the Suez crisis in 1956 and Congo in 1960–61 to post–Cold War UN peacekeeping failures and successes in countries such as Cambodia, Rwanda, and Somalia. The book works best as a portrait of the far-flung, underappreciated UN peacekeeping system as it has grown and evolved. But Goldstein does not provide a sustained explanation for why interstate war has declined. Neglecting to dig deeply into the changing sources of violence and insecurity, the book leaves its central puzzle unsolved.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."
60,The Justice Cascade: How Human Rights Prosecutions Are Changing World Politics,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2011-11-01/justice-cascade-how-human-rights-prosecutions-are-changing-world,The Justice Cascade: How Human Rights Prosecutions Are Changing World Politics,"For centuries, states and state officials were largely immune from prosecution for human rights violations in domestic and foreign courts. But in recent decades, this has changed, and now former or even sitting heads of state are brought before various national and international courts or tribunals. In this impressive study, Sikkink tracks and explains this truly remarkable shift. A dramatic breakthrough occurred in 1998, when General Augusto Pinochet, the former ruler of Chile, was arrested in London on an extradition request by a Spanish court seeking to try him for crimes committed during his military dictatorship. Later, several sitting heads of state -- notably, Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia and Charles Taylor of Liberia -- were indicted for war crimes. Sikkink traces the evolution in the reigning orthodoxy about states and human right violations, the result of a series of shifts in international legal standards and practices. It is an inspiring story of the rise and spread of a set of ideas and norms -- what she calls a “justice cascade,” propelled to a great degree by the tireless efforts of human rights activists in Europe and Latin America.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."
61,Civilization: The West and the Rest,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2011-11-01/civilization-west-and-rest,Civilization: The West and the Rest,"This enjoyably sprawling history of “the rise of the West,” written for a general audience, follows in the footsteps of major works by such scholars as John Darwin, Jared Diamond, William NcNeill, and Douglass North. Like them, Ferguson grapples with the grand puzzle of the modern world: Why did the West, which in 1500 was no more advanced than the other world civilizations -- most notably China, India, and Islam -- rise up over the following five centuries to amass great power and wealth and come to dominate the world? Ferguson rejects explanations that focus on European imperialism or the uniqueness of geography, climate, or culture. Instead, he argues that Western ascendency was unleashed by the uniquely decentralized, open, rule-based, and competitive character of European politics, economics, and society. Individual chapters look at the role of competition, science, property rights, medicine, consumer society, and the work ethic in distinguishing the West. The book is written with an eye on the rise of China and leaves the reader with a crucial question: Are the ideas and institutions of Western civilization becoming truly universal, or will the rise of non-Western states usher in alternative pathways to modernization and advancement?Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."
62,The Dying Bear,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/russia-fsu/2011-11-01/dying-bear,The Dying Bear,"December marks the 20th anniversary of the end of the Soviet dictatorship and the beginning of Russia's postcommunist transition. For Russians, the intervening years have been full of elation and promise but also unexpected trouble and disappointment. Perhaps of all the painful developments in Russian society since the Soviet collapse, the most surprising -- and dismaying -- is the country's demographic decline. Over the past two decades, Russia has been caught in the grip of a devastating and highly anomalous peacetime population crisis. The country's population has been shrinking, its mortality levels are nothing short of catastrophic, and its human resources appear to be dangerously eroding."
63,The Wisdom of Retrenchment,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/americas/wisdom-retrenchment,The Wisdom of Retrenchment,"In the wake of the Cold War, U.S. foreign policy underwent a profound transformation. Unrestrained by superpower competition, the United States' ambitions spilled over their former limits. Washington increased its military spending far faster than any of its rivals, expanded NATO, and started dispatching forces around the world on humanitarian missions while letting key allies drift away. These trends accelerated after 9/11, as the United States went to war in Afghanistan and Iraq, ramped up its counterterrorism operations around the world, sped up its missile defense program, and set up new bases in distant lands."
64,The Sick Man of Asia,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2011-11-01/sick-man-asia,The Sick Man of Asia,"Although China has made remarkable economic progress over the past few decades, its citizens’ health has not improved as much. Since 1980, the country has achieved an average economic growth rate of ten percent and lifted 400–500 million people out of poverty. Yet Chinese official data suggest that average life expectancy in China rose by only about five years between 1981 and 2009, from roughly 68 years to 73 years. (It had increased by almost 33 years between 1949 and 1980.) In countries that had similar life expectancy levels in 1981 but had slower economic growth thereafter -- Colombia, Malaysia, Mexico, and South Korea, for example -- by 2009 life expectancy had increased by 7–14 years. According to the World Bank, even in Australia, Hong Kong, Japan, and Singapore, which had much higher life expectancy figures than China in 1981, those figures rose by 7–10 years during the same period."
65,Can Europe’s Divided House Stand?,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/europe/2011-11-01/can-europes-divided-house-stand,Can Europe’s Divided House Stand?,"Conventional wisdom has it that the eurozone cannot have a monetary union without also having a fiscal union. Euro-enthusiasts see the single currency as the first steppingstone toward a broader economic union, which is their dream. Euroskeptics do, too, but they see that endgame as hell -- and would prefer the single currency to be dismantled. The euro crisis has, for many observers, validated these notions. Both camps argue that the eurozone countries’ lopsided efforts to construct a monetary union without a fiscal counterpart explain why the union has become such a mess. Many of the enthusiasts say that the way forward is for the 17 eurozone countries to issue euro bonds, which they would all guarantee (one of several variations on the fiscal-union theme). Even the German government, which is reluctant to bail out economies weaker than its own, thinks that some sort of pooling of budgets may be needed once the current debt problems have been solved."
66,Humanitarian Intervention Comes of Age,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2011-11-01/humanitarian-intervention-comes-age,Humanitarian Intervention Comes of Age,"No sooner had NATO launched its first air strike in Libya than the mission was thrown into controversy -- and with it, the more general notion of humanitarian intervention. Days after the UN Security Council authorized international forces to protect civilians and establish a no-fly zone, NATO seemed to go beyond its mandate as several of its members explicitly demanded that Libyan leader Muammar al-Qaddafi step down. It soon became clear that the fighting would last longer than expected. Foreign policy realists and other critics likened the Libyan operation to the disastrous engagements of the early 1990s in Somalia, Rwanda, and Bosnia, arguing that humanitarian intervention is the wrong way to respond to intrastate violence and civil war, especially following the debacles in Afghanistan and Iraq."

68,The Broken Contract,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2011-10-11/broken-contract,The Broken Contract,"Iraq was one of those wars where people actually put on pounds. A few years ago, I was eating lunch with another reporter at an American-style greasy spoon in Baghdad's Green Zone. At a nearby table, a couple of American contractors were finishing off their burgers and fries. They were wearing the contractor's uniform: khakis, polo shirts, baseball caps, and Department of Defense identity badges in plastic pouches hanging from nylon lanyards around their necks. The man who had served their food might have been the only Iraqi they spoke with all day. The Green Zone was set up to make you feel that Iraq was a hallucination and you were actually in Normal, Illinois. This narcotizing effect seeped into the consciousness of every American who hunkered down and worked and partied behind its blast walls -- the soldier and the civilian, the diplomat and the journalist, the important and the obscure. Hardly anyone stayed longer than a year; almost everyone went home with a collection of exaggerated war stories, making an effort to forget that they were leaving behind shoddy, unfinished projects and a country spiraling downward into civil war. As the two contractors got up and ambled out of the restaurant, my friend looked at me and said, ""We're just not that good anymore."""

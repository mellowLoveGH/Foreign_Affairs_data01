0,Permanent Emergency Welfare Regimes in Sub-Saharan Africa: The Exclusive Origins of Dictatorship and Democracy,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2013-08-21/permanent-emergency-welfare-regimes-sub-saharan-africa-exclusive,Permanent Emergency Welfare Regimes in Sub-Saharan Africa: The Exclusive Origins of Dictatorship and Democracy,"A longtime observer of social welfare systems in Europe, Cerami brings his keen insight to bear on the relationship between the failure of African states to provide welfare protection and social services to the majority of their populations and the increase in social inequality, ethnic tension, and political violence in the region. The inevitable result of this failure is strife between the elite minorities that states protect and the majorities that are left in chronic insecurity, leading to a climate of violence that is hostile to the survival of democracy. Cerami concludes that improvements in social welfare -- and the economic growth they would help produce -- will require the further democratization of public life. But the book says too little about the progress that has been made on poverty alleviation and democratization in recent years, and the distinctions it makes between the African cases it examines are too reductive to be fully convincing. Still, Cerami’s novel approach to his topic makes this book worthwhile.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."
1,Democracy and Prebendalism in Nigeria: Critical Interpretations,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2013-08-21/democracy-and-prebendalism-nigeria-critical-interpretations,Democracy and Prebendalism in Nigeria: Critical Interpretations,"In a seminal 1987 study of Nigeria, the political scientist Richard Joseph argued that the country’s political culture was strongly influenced by the fact that holding public office provided officials with access to resources and that the theft of such resources went largely unpunished. Joseph called this system “prebendalism,” likening it to European feudal practices. The contributors to this volume use the prism of prebendalism to look at the permanent struggle in Nigeria over access to public resources, which structures the way Nigerians perceive citizenship, shapes the country’s complex and sometimes contentious ethnic dynamics, and contributes to growing social inequality. The problem is that although the dismal performance of the country’s economy has always been largely due to egregiously high levels of governmental malfeasance, the true extent of public corruption in Nigeria today is difficult to determine. Still, the mostly excellent essays in the book would have benefited from some attempt to empirically measure the practices the authors deplore.

2,Voting in Fear: Electoral Violence in Sub-Saharan Africa,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2013-08-21/voting-fear-electoral-violence-sub-saharan-africa,Voting in Fear: Electoral Violence in Sub-Saharan Africa,"This exceptional collection of essays examines why roughly a fifth of the elections in sub-Saharan Africa since 1990 have led to violence. Some observers have rather hastily blamed the introduction of democracy for the political violence that has wracked the region in recent years, asserting that the zero-sum nature of electoral campaigns polarizes fledgling democracies and makes them particularly vulnerable to violence, especially when politics is organized along ethnic or regional lines. But using a new data set of recorded violent episodes, as well as careful case studies of Cote d’Ivoire, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, and Zimbabwe, the contributors show that in fact such violence has been mostly instigated by incumbent politicians seeking to intimidate the opposition in order to remain in power. Violence by the opposition is less common and typically results from relatively spontaneous discontent over egregiously unfair electoral outcomes. In sum, the essays in this book suggest that African electoral violence results not from an excess of democracy but from the fact that many of the elections in the region are hardly democratic at all.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."
3,The World’s Most Dangerous Place; Al Shabaab in Somalia,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2013-08-21/worlds-most-dangerous-place-al-shabaab-somalia,The World’s Most Dangerous Place; Al Shabaab in Somalia,"When Somalia won its independence in 1960, experts hailed it as one of the few countries in sub-Saharan Africa with a bright future because it lacked ethnic divisions and thus constituted one of the region’s few genuine nation-states. But several decades of corrupt and inept rule led to economic collapse and growing divisions within the complex mosaic of clans that form Somali society. State collapse in the early 1990s led to civil war, piracy off the Somali coast, international interventions of varying degrees of success, and eventually the emergence of militant Islamism. By 2010, al Shabab, the most militant of several Islamist groups that claim loyalty to al Qaeda, had gained control of the southern half of the country. It was soon routed by an international force assembled by the African Union. But for a couple of years, al Shabab represented the only al Qaeda affiliate in control of a sizable territory."

One of the most eloquent proponents has been the Peking University law professor He, some of whose writings are translated in this volume, with an informative introduction by Cheng Li. The more academic essays are dry, but He shows clarity, eloquence, and humor in his university lectures, panel discussions, and postings on social media, where he opines on a wide range of topics, including freedom of the press, judicial independence, the illegitimacy of the National People’s Congress, police abuse, the death penalty, and Tibet. The government tried to silence him by assigning him to teach for several years in the remote western province of Xinjiang, but it has not put him in jail despite an intensifying crackdown on liberal critics -- perhaps because he sticks to theoretical advocacy and reasons carefully within the law. This volume shows why his ideas have wide appeal.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."
5,The Lius of Shanghai,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2013-08-21/lius-shanghai,The Lius of Shanghai,"Liu Hongsheng (1888–1956) was a prosperous Shanghai industrialist whose household exemplified the traditional Confucian family’s transition into modernity. Cochran discovered a trove of letters that span the 1920s to the 1950s, as family members pursued education, marriage, and business prospects all over China and in Japan and the West. He and his co-author provide historical context and sensitive cultural and psychological interpretations but allow most of the story to come out in the family’s sometimes stilted but honest and moving words. Father guides the educations and careers of his nine sons to prepare them to oversee different parts of his expanding business empire. Mother stands guard over her children’s marital choices and worries about whether her husband has other women (he does). Eldest Daughter has an affair with a married man; her parents disown her, but they eventually reconcile. Sixth Son converts to Christianity and then joins the Communist Party. Once the Communists come to power, after much indecision, Father brings most of the children back to mainland China, and the keyhole on this fascinating saga regrettably closes.

Today, 11 of the disputes remain at least partially unsettled, of which the most important are with India (over their land border) and with Vietnam and four other countries (over maritime borders). Each chapter in this useful book describes China’s relations with one of its neighbors; provides instructive maps; and analyzes the territories at stake, the history of negotiations, the relevant legal and strategic issues, and current economic and security relations. Even uncontested borders present daunting problems of control, and some of the settled boundaries have the potential to reemerge as problems in the future.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

But the country is poorly understood in the West. Linked to India by language and to Pakistan by religion, Bangladesh has struggled to define an identity different from its neighbors’ that embraces its own linguistic, religious, ethnic, and ideological diversity. The country has gone through more than its rightful share of trauma: colonialism, partition from India, a war for independence against a brutal Pakistani army, internal rebellions by minority tribes, poverty, flooding, and factory disasters. Yet a pluralistic, proud, and self-aware culture has emerged; the economy is growing; feminism contends with fundamentalism; and periods of party politics alternate with those of military rule. This revelatory volume brings alive Bangladesh’s tormented history and vibrant culture through a selection of excerpts and illustrations from works of history, journalism, literature, and visual art.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

A former CIA analyst and frequent presidential adviser, Riedel focuses on the Cold War and after. He shows that the American desire for simultaneous good relations with both rival powers has been doomed by the three countries’ fundamentally incompatible security needs. Resenting its colonial past, India is determined to remain independent of any great-power entanglements. Pakistan, as the weaker of the two rivals, has frantically played a double game with the United States and India -- and also with Afghanistan, China, and domestic and foreign terrorist groups. It is hard to know what a coherent security strategy for Pakistan would look like, but it is clear that Pakistani elites do not have one. This makes it hard to be optimistic about Riedel’s suggestions at the end of the book for how to stabilize Pakistan by pushing it to resolve its problems with India.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

Jalal, his grandniece, uses his published writings and family letters and her interviews with relatives to portray his complex relationships and turbulent career. Interweaving stories from his fiction and events from his life, she produces a rich, if somewhat disjointed, tapestry of a complex society and the tensions that built up to the explosive violence of partition in 1947. In the aftermath, Manto, dying from the effects of alcoholism, directed his last sardonic barbs at the martyrdom-peddling mullahs and U.S.-allied cold warriors who were taking control of his young country.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

The crisis response of the Self-Defense Forces (and the U.S. military, which assisted them) earned high marks from the public but generated no shift toward a more muscular security posture and no breakthroughs on the issue of how or whether Japan should continue to host U.S. forces. Nuclear power lost support and regulations were tightened, but any phase-out was postponed indefinitely. Local governments gained prestige and learned some new ways of cooperating but did not get increased formal powers. If the Japanese people showed resilience in the face of catastrophe, so did their political system, flaws and all.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

Their analysis is terse, and their portrait of U.S. efforts to broker Arab-Israeli peace is bleak. They see only three successes: Israel’s disengagement from the Sinai in 1973, the Camp David accords of 1978, and the Madrid peace conference of 1991, which ultimately failed but set the stage for the Oslo negotiations. Since then, there have been some near misses: the Taba meetings in February 2001 and the Israeli-Palestinian talks triggered by the Annapolis negotiations of November 2007. But overall, the best and the brightest U.S. diplomats have produced precious little. The authors assert that American policymakers must address the core issues, transform their natural bias toward Israel into a positive factor, recapture bipartisan resolve to tackle the issue, maintain continuity across administrations, and persuade the Israelis and the Palestinians that Washington understands and respects their fundamental interests. But another reading might be that the U.S. role is simply to keep the dance going even if it resolves nothing, since even if the parties are incapable of agreement, dancing endlessly is better than hitting a wall.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

Indeed, it seems the editors have intentionally chosen two very different regimes to study in order to understand common authoritarian techniques. Their bottom line is clear: “Authoritarianism in the Middle East will survive this transformational moment.” The contributing authors sustain that contention with considerable evidence. Their expertise in the tactics of political survival and their deep knowledge of the two countries are impressive. The basic thesis is that authoritarians in Iran and Syria can weather the daunting structural challenges they face through “recombinant” adaptations: establishing state-sponsored nongovernmental organizations to create a veneer of civil society; cooperating with some genuine civil-society groups, including religious associations; and making use of many forms of coercion, both legal and extralegal. The autocrats in Tehran and Damascus are inventive and crafty. But the two regimes offer no paradigm of autocratic survival. There is a distinct risk that in seeing the outcome of regime persistence, observers might incorrectly attribute it to a set of coherent tactics. In fact, luck and simple agility might be equally compelling factors. In Syria’s case, that luck might have finally run out.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

These two books help fill the void. Luomi looks at government policymaking in the face of global warming. Sowers focuses on the networks of activists, nongovernmental organizations, and public experts fitfully interacting in order to bend that policy process. Ironies abound: Abu Dhabi’s planned Masdar City and the Masdar Institute, together constituting a “renewable energy and clean-technology hub” that aims to be carbon neutral, would have been impossible without high oil prices. It is probably the highly globalized nature of the Gulf states’ economies that prompt them to embrace the theater, if not the substance, of mitigating global warming. But in the end, Luomi avers, it might be the high opportunity cost of using petroleum for domestic purposes that will push Abu Dhabi and Qatar toward the domestic use of natural gas and the development of solar and wind power."

His report on the state of science in the Arab world is withering, but not despairing. All the ingredients for Arab success in research and development are at hand except the political culture and will. Organic links among universities, industries, and markets do not exist in the Arab world because governments have funded turnkey projects without insisting that developers share underlying technologies. This “off the shelf” approach means that neither governments nor industries need to turn to universities or research centers for advanced research and development. With that critical link broken, there is little impetus for the development of the type of professional associations and networks that undergird scientific professionalism. There is also no impetus for pan-Arab scientific cooperation. The results are clear. In 2009, there were only 31 scientists in the Arab world with any measure of international visibility. Since 1970, South Korea’s research-and-development output has increased from half the size of the Arab world’s to 20 times as large, and Israel’s research output, on a per capita basis, is 26 times as large as the Arab world’s.

This is the third volume, devoted to Kafka’s final, tempestuous years (1916–24), opening as World War I begins and ending with Kafka’s death in a sanatorium near Vienna. In portraying Kafka, Stach winds together and then cuts deeply into his subject’s intense personal relationships, his turbulent twists of mind, the dramas of his daily life, and the darker consequences of war. Viewing the events of these years -- the emotional tensions the war produced in Prague and its crushing impact on the people caught in its wake -- through the life of a supremely vexed, historic literary figure, this book stretches history in a way that more conventional histories cannot.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

It is the unsettled hinterland of both East Asia and South Asia, as well as Russia’s critical southern flank. Laruelle and Peyrouse do the region justice with this perceptive and informed survey of the approach of outside powers to it, while factoring in what the Central Asian states themselves have going for and against them in this complex whirl of relations. By focusing on the challenges that globalization presents for all the countries that have a stake in Central Asia, they rescue the region from the simple parallels many reach for -- such as today’s supposed reprise of the nineteenth-century Great Game between Russia and the United Kingdom, this time between Russia and the United States. They instead highlight the more complicated “little games” played by a multitude of actors -- not just the Americans, the Chinese, and the Russians but also the European Union, India, Pakistan, Iran, and the Arab states of the Middle East -- and explore the equally complex interplay among the five Central Asian countries themselves. If strategic calculations still influence the players, they argue, they are now overshadowed by economic objectives and the new century’s nebulous but menacing security threats.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

Sistema, Power Networks, and Informal Governance","The Chinese call it guanxi; the Russians, sistema. It exists in one form or another in most countries. It is the informal, sometimes illegal way things get done through connections, bribes, and favors. It is one thing when the phenomenon of “you scratch my back, and I’ll scratch yours” propels political life but stays within a formal institutional framework. But when that practice supplants constitutional institutions and processes, it is quite another -- and that is what has happened in Russia. The Russian system is an immense web of illicit networks. Ledeneva has studied them from the ground up in earlier works; in this book, she inspects them from the top down. These “power networks,” as she calls them, form a dense maze rather than a neat hierarchy and thus belie the notion of President Vladimir Putin as an untrammeled autocrat. Unlike in a spider web, however, their lines are motley, blurred, and fluid. Most of the book explores in depth how the networks function, but Ledeneva’s larger conclusion stresses the paradox that necessary as these informal clusters are to the functioning of the Russian state, they also pose a significant barrier to its modernization.

Its maturity derives from the balance that it brings to a charged subject -- the life of Jozef Tiso, a Catholic priest who championed Slovak independence and allied himself with Adolf Hitler during World War II -- from the intelligence of the argument that Ward melds with this disconcerting biography, and from the unpretentious clarity with which it is written. In tracing Tiso’s life -- from childhood to the scaffold on which the Czechoslovakian government executed him in 1947 -- and identifying its tortured echoes in contemporary Slovakia, Ward probes the effect of Catholicism on the Slovak nationalism of the 1930s and on the priest’s own lethal form of anti-Semitic self-justification. Ward depicts Tiso as defined by dualities -- conviction and convenience, faith and politics, Christianity and Nazism -- and embodying the complexity, extremes, hopes, and tragedies of the Czechs and the Slovaks during the 1930s.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

The dissident Soviet priest suffered eight and a half years in Stalin’s gulag, challenged KGB-allied church elders on his release, and became famous in the 1970s for his truth telling and humane ministrations, only to be broken by the regime’s prisons in the early 1980s, from which he emerged a crude Russian nationalist, anti-Semite, and fan of Stalin. Bullough does not so much focus on the mystery of his conversion as literally travel the path of his life, journeying to the far north, where Dudko labored in prison camps and where Bullough tests himself during an Arctic winter and a mosquito-infested summer. Bullough knits the priest’s tortured biography into a larger exposition of Russia’s steady degradation, driven by alcoholism and reflected in a growing demographic crisis. He appears torn over whether to limit his judgment of Dudko to the good he did for individual parishioners or to consider the reactionary lengths to which Dudko went as a form of justified resistance to Russia’s slide into a moral swamp.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

But rarely does an outsider get to see and feel them as intimately as Shishkin, a Russian-born journalist who writes for Western media and who has made his way into virtually every turbulent moment in the recent history of these countries. He was in the streets of Bishkek during Kyrgyzstan’s 2005 Tulip Revolution and in the White House -- the seat of executive power in the country -- as rioters ransacked the place. He snuck through police cordons to see the carnage Uzbek troops wrought in Andijon during the 2005 antiregime protests. He returned in the wake of the 2010 Kyrgyz revolution that chased from power President Kurmanbek Bakiyev, whose regime had more than trumped the corruption of its predecessor. And Shishkin stayed for the micro civil war between Uzbeks and Kyrgyz that erupted in the Fergana Valley region soon after.

Particularly strong are the chapters on trade, economic development, and crime, which deftly summarize and analyze these policy areas over the last few decades. Also interesting is a chapter by Smith that explains current theories of global power and where Mexico fits within them. Mexico’s new president, Enrique Peña Nieto, is in the early months of a six-year term, and as his government struggles to balance an ambitious economic agenda with the ongoing challenges of insecurity and violence, the historically grounded perspectives in this book can serve as important correctives to ephemeral news reports and commentary, pointing to the factors that will truly shape outcomes in Mexico and its relations with the United States.

In her substantial introduction to this edited volume, she envisions small and medium-sized cooperatives -- relatively autonomous of the state, internally democratic, and community conscious -- becoming an important pillar of a post-Castro socialism that would preserve core revolutionary values. Distrusting private enterprise, which she believes promotes excessive egoism and inequality, Piñeiro Harnecker must be pleased by recent Cuban reforms that assign preferential treatment to cooperatives over individual self-employment. Looking forward, she rightly calls for oversight to ensure that cooperatives comply with their stipulated principles and to support their economic success. Searching for lessons from abroad, the volume contains informative chapters assessing industrial cooperatives in Spain, cooperative housing in Uruguay, the “solidarity economy” in Brazil, worker-recovered enterprises in Argentina, and “direct social property” in Venezuela. In a hard-hitting evaluation of Cuba’s agriculture, Armando Nova González argues that cooperatives and private farms have been significantly more productive than the large state-managed units.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

A literate and observant artist by profession, Bustos extols Guevara’s sacrificial utopianism and historical fatalism, yet his stories constitute a less flattering profile of the man’s leadership style and analytic grasp. Notably, Bustos confirms that Guevara’s strategic goal was not revolution in Bolivia but something more grandiose: seizing power in Argentina. Bustos also suggests that a duplicitous Cuba abandoned Guevara: by the time of his capture, “Havana had already taken off its earphones and pulled down its antennae.” Now settled in Sweden, Bustos distinguishes between what he considers his lifetime of selfless revolutionary idealism and “terrorist martyrdom, which carries out someone else’s design in return for a place in paradise.”Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

In his prime, Castro was remarkably intelligent, energetic, and resilient, filled with self-righteous anger, a heightened sense of honor and dignity, and boundless self-confidence. For many Cubans, Castro is George Washington (independence warrior and first president), Abraham Lincoln (the towering liberator), and Franklin Roosevelt (the fearless social reformer) all wrapped up in one giant man. But Castro is also a tragic figure, seemingly unaware of his own limitations: arrogant and stubborn, unable to adjust to the post-Soviet world, and utterly unwilling to imagine Cuba without himself at the helm. Caistor’s monograph is a smoothly crafted and balanced rendition, although a bit too dispassionate to fully convey the intensity of the times.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

To reconstruct the lives and passions of her predecessors on the sugar estates of Barbados -- a group that included elite planters, middle-class mulattos, and enslaved blacks -- Stuart turns to better-recorded histories and relies on some informed speculation. But with her diverse roots, she is well placed to penetrate the intertwined cultures of masters and slaves and reveal how the plantation system damaged all those trapped by its extreme exploitation and systemic violence. Stuart also finds triumphant stories of hard work and happiness against the odds -- and of fabulous wealth that not only enabled survival in the tropics but also helped build modern London and fuel the British Empire.

Mexico is indeed marching forward, consolidating its multiparty democracy, growing its middle class, and integrating its factories into global supply chains. A rapidly modernizing Mexico City stands as one of the world’s great metropolises. Moreover, some underlying social trends are moving in the right direction: for example, fertility rates are decreasing, which over time tends to correlate with rising wages and falling crime. U.S. policy has responded to these changes (albeit sometimes too timidly, in O’Neil’s view), most notably through the successful North American Free Trade Agreement, recent plans to upgrade border infrastructure, U.S. assistance to Mexican law enforcement, and, if the Obama administration prevails, immigration reform. O’Neil stops short of endorsing the kind of comprehensive regional integration advanced by Robert Pastor in his seminal 2011 book, The North American Idea, but argues cogently that the two countries “will now rise and fall together, two nations indivisible.”Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

Yet everyone concedes that its most important causes, consequences, and remedies are essentially political. This is one of the first books that addresses the deeper political significance of the crisis, focusing primarily on Europe’s troubled relationship with Greece and highlighting the ways in which southern European political systems, societies, and economies have long functioned according to fundamentally different rules from those followed elsewhere in Europe. Since the outbreak of the crisis, the EU has been attempting to force convergence from the center, having replaced the International Monetary Fund as the world’s most important guarantor of financial rectitude. Yet in many ways, the result has been greater divergence, as European countries struggle with debt and austerity measures. Absent a major push toward a European federal state, the authors portray a stark choice for Greece: retreat from European integration, or lose many of the attributes of a sovereign state.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

Her basic thesis is that French farmers have been more successful than their American counterparts at persuading their government to oppose the use of genetically modified organisms not because that position is intrinsically French (it originated in Vermont) or because French farmers enjoy more political clout. Rather, the French farmers have prevailed because they linked their cause to powerful legitimating symbols and political values in France: preserving small farms and small towns, resisting unjust state authority, maintaining the power of unions, combating the spread of McDonald’s and other fast-food chains, and defending the integrity of local communities and traditional practices. In the United States, such tactics would be less effective, she argues, because the American public lacks a sense of solidarity with unions, farmers, or purveyors of gourmet food. It is hard to know if Heller is right, but her tale of earthy farmers becoming postmodern ideological entrepreneurs makes for fun reading.

29,Story of My People,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2013-08-12/story-my-people,Story of My People,"Nesi is a third-generation Italian businessman. Under his leadership, his family’s textile business went bankrupt. Today, he is a successful writer. Here, he chronicles the sad story of free trade’s impact on “his people” in the town of Prato, capturing the distinctive pain of a modern European left behind, a cultural stranger in his own land. The Chinese have demolished Italian firms like Nesi’s, a process Nesi blames on the neoliberal economists and trade negotiators who hailed unconditional globalization without understanding how global market competition actually works. In his view, the embrace of free trade spelled the end of a postwar Italian society of dynamic small enterprises that produced custom goods in a way that distributed wealth and skills fairly, rather than concentrating them in the hands of a few. It is painful to read about family-run artisanal businesses being supplanted by filthy sweatshops allied with criminal groups. Yet there is an unintentional irony here as well, since not only what Nesi dislikes but also nearly everything he loves is the fruit of globalization. His family business rested primarily on exports to Germany and sales to the global clients of famous Italian designers. The films and ideas that inspire his metaphors come from Hollywood and Harvard, not his own country.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

They have uncovered stone tools and gnawed bones that humanoid creatures left behind more than a million years ago. They have shown how a quarter of a million years ago, Neanderthals controlled fire, cared for their elderly and sick, and buried their dead in the expectation of an afterlife. Most striking is new information about a number of advanced Bronze Age and Iron Age civilizations, not just in the Mediterranean but throughout northern Europe, that boasted large cities, delicate art, sophisticated technology, and complex trading routes reaching all the way to China. Although most of these cultures were crushed by the Greek, Roman, and Viking empires, an extraordinary amount of archaeological and genetic evidence testifies to their creativity. Their political and cultural legacies contribute to the diversity that characterizes modern Europe. In this engaging and lavishly illustrated volume, Price powerfully links these new findings to specific locations; readers who visit almost any European country will want to add a prehistoric site to their itinerary.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

Myriad details, from her early romances to her relationships with senior colleagues, illuminate the complexity and contradictions of this clever scientist turned politician from a lower-middle-class background: her nervousness at meeting the queen of England; her disdain for the affectations of the upper classes, which did not diminish her fierce desire to join them; and her surprising tendency to defer to experts and bow to pragmatism. Along the way, Moore skillfully captures just how odd it was for a woman to head the world’s stuffiest political party and then to become prime minister: in one scene, he describes the tears, at once chivalrous and wistful, that welled up in the eyes of Conservative Party grandees when Thatcher was named their leader in 1975. The book concludes with Thatcher’s finest hour: her leadership during the 1982 Falklands War between the United Kingdom and Argentina.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

As the publisher of the The News & Observer, he was at the center of North Carolina politics for half a century. In national politics, he was best known as a confidant of President Woodrow Wilson, serving as secretary of the navy during Wilson’s two terms. But Daniels’ most lasting contribution was his role in constructing the so-called New South. With Daniels’ assistance and leadership, Democrats in North Carolina established the state’s first real public school system, promoted industrial development, and built paved roads for the automobile age. But these “progressives” also broke African American political power. As late as 1898, African Americans controlled local governments in parts of the state and played an influential role in state politics. But Daniels -- who later arranged for Wilson to watch the pro–Ku Klux Klan film The Birth of a Nation -- helped orchestrate the racial polarization that led to the destruction of black political power in North Carolina. A complex and fascinating figure, Daniels deserves a better biography than this well-researched but underdeveloped book.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

Its traditional vision of an alliance between government and big corporations in pursuing an ambitious foreign policy and creating a strong business climate at home faces opposition from a libertarian Tea Party wing that hates crony capitalism and is suspicious of ambitious government projects. In a book that deserves to be read by Republicans who care about their party’s future, Lowry calls for a return to the ideas of President Abraham Lincoln, who represented large railroad corporations as an attorney but who passionately believed in individual opportunity as the best remedy for poverty. Lowry is mostly right about Lincoln’s politics, although not many establishment Republicans today would support Lincoln’s archprotectionist industrial policies. And it remains to be seen whether the approach that some have termed “opportunity conservatism” could appeal to both wings of today’s divided GOP. After all, part of the party’s problem is cultural: some of today’s most enthusiastic Republicans seem more nostalgic for Robert E. Lee than for Lincoln.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

Roosevelt and Five Extraordinary Men Took America Into the War and Into the World,"Fullilove is a gifted narrative historian, as this immensely readable and enjoyable book demonstrates. His tale of the men U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt sent on overseas diplomatic missions in the crucial years preceding the United States’ entry into World War II benefits from Fullilove’s eye for telling details and knack for entertaining anecdotes. Unfortunately, the subject cannot bear all the weight Fullilove places on it. Amid the careful political strategy and slow but inexorable unfolding of Roosevelt’s relentless march toward war, these emissaries -- among them W. Averell Harriman, Sumner Welles, and Harry Hopkins -- were significantly less important than the book maintains. Fullilove also neglects the crosscurrents in relations among the Allies; there is little here, for example, about Roosevelt’s determination to use World War II to break the British Empire and replace it with a Washington-based international system. The book is more an amuse-bouche than a serious dish. Perhaps Fullilove’s future work will combine the artistry and flair on display here with a sharper focus on larger events.

This book is shaped in equal parts by Nasr’s affection for his former boss and by anger at what Nasr sees as a callow White House staff that treated Holbrooke poorly. Nasr makes a powerful case that U.S. strategy in Afghanistan and the Middle East is muddled and confused. Yet when it comes to alternative policies, he proposes an option that will strike most readers as both utopian and forlorn: a Marshall Plan for the region. The massive cost to the already strapped U.S. federal budget would be the least of the obstacles such an initiative would face. For decades, most U.S. aid to Middle Eastern governments has done more to enrich the politically connected than to improve conditions for the masses. With the region now embroiled in a grim combination of the 1848 revolutions and the Thirty Years’ War, Nasr’s proposal seems fanciful. Perhaps both the White House and Nasr face a common problem: it is hard to develop good strategy when the choices are all bad.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

The intelligent thing to do, he reasons, is to use the opportunity to shore up the U.S. economy while pursuing a low-profile, cost-minimizing policy overseas. This is not a book about U.S. decline: Haass believes that a combination of U.S. strength and the weakness of potential rivals offers Washington the luxury of focusing on internal challenges. In a sense, then, this is a book about collecting a peace dividend. More than 20 years after the fall of the Soviet Union, Russia remains weak. China is not ready to launch a serious power competition with the United States, and violent jihadists are divided among themselves and unable to present a coherent threat. There can be no better time, Haass argues, for the United States to address its slowing dynamism at home. Haass delivers a cogent picture of the world and supports it with sharp and precise arguments. The foreign policy prescriptions are more thoroughly worked out than some of the domestic ideas, but that is to be expected whenever a foreign policy expert looks homeward.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

It seems as though every aspect of the “war on terror” has now been documented in detail, with few identities left hidden or operations left unrevealed. Mazzetti’s fine account traces the embrace of drone-assisted targeted killing by an organization that began the century prohibited from engaging in assassination and lacking the budget to purchase expensive hardware. U.S. attempts to detain terrorists are fraught with legal problems, and attempts to deny them sanctuaries require unpopular and extensive deployments of boots on the ground, so it is no surprise that simply taking out these targets became such an attractive option for Washington. Nor is it a surprise that the CIA quickly began to ease the safeguards governing the use of drones, resulting in growing unease among the public and policymakers at the processes the White House was using to choose targets and the complex effects the strikes were having on countries such as Pakistan and Yemen. Mazzetti describes in compelling detail the agency’s turf battles with the Pentagon, its awkward relations with its Pakistani counterpart, and its reliance on a motley collection of freelancers and private contractors."

Klein’s monumental book focuses on what he calls “the greatest industrial expansion in modern history.” As the war began in Europe in 1939, the armed forces of the United States were small and undernourished, and the public was wary of any involvement. President Franklin Roosevelt pushed U.S. industry to get ready for a war that he knew would come. Klein details the impact this had on Washington -- the personality clashes, the interagency feuds, the tensions between government and big business -- and also demonstrates the enormous social impact of mass mobilization on the rest of society. Labor unions were challenged to moderate their demands out of patriotic duty, and African Americans were drawn into the mainstream work force, leading to hostile reactions from some white workers and even race riots in Detroit. In effect, Klein’s book narrates the birth pangs of the modern American state."

It is theoretically possible that economic growth in some countries will worsen the economic well-being of their trading partners, and some commentators have suggested that the success of today’s emerging markets, especially China, has been detrimental to the United States and other rich countries. That might be true if the global economy had experienced an overall reduction in trade, but that has not occurred, except briefly during the financial crisis of 2008 and the subsequent recession. Growth in emerging markets could also hurt rich countries by raising their import prices relative to their export prices. Although that has happened from time to time, especially with regard to oil prices, on balance, import prices have fallen. Edwards and Lawrence undertake a painstaking and detailed examination of the influence in recent decades of foreign trade on U.S. employment, wages, and income distribution. Their bottom line is that Americans should welcome the growing prosperity of their trading partners.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

He reviews the intellectual history of the idea, from the Enlightenment to the present, and examines the numerous cases in which it has been tried, all of which proved unsuccessful, except in a few special circumstances. He is attentive not only to the effects of austerity on the economy in the aggregate but also to the way its effects are distributed, usually in ways that disproportionately hurt the poorer members of society. Blyth asserts that the slogan “There is no alternative” is often a cloak that doctrinaire conservatives use to mask their desire to reduce the size of government. He counters that levying much higher taxes on wealthy Americans and Europeans would reduce budget deficits without requiring any spending cuts."

The United Kingdom and the United States, close wartime allies, had vastly different views about what the postwar system should look like. British Prime Minister Winston Churchill wanted to preserve the British Empire, as did the British economist John Maynard Keynes, who represented the United Kingdom at Bretton Woods. Although he was no imperialist, Keynes saw British colonialism as an economic necessity. The Americans, on the other hand, thought it was about time the British got out of the business of world domination, and they pushed for a system that would reflect the new balance of power between the two allies. Steil is concerned not only with the substance of the negotiations but also with the key players, most notably Keynes, who was already famous by the time of the Bretton Woods meeting, and Harry Dexter White, the U.S. Treasury official who led the American negotiating team.

But then, its economy stalled, stymied by political disagreements over the best ways to reduce poverty -- through direct government action or through the indirect effects of growth -- and over the degree to which the country should engage with the global economy. Both debates are shaped by strong sentiments in favor of protecting local businesses and workers -- a residue of India’s socialist past. Against such views, Bhagwati and Panagariya advocate for growth through increased trade with the world and more foreign investment in India. They confront what they consider to be 19 myths about the Indian economy, ranging from the claim that Indian planners pursued growth as an end in itself, ignoring poverty reduction, to the belief that post-1991 reforms of the Indian economy increased government corruption and resulted in a high incidence of suicides among farmers. Demolishing those myths, the authors propose ways to accelerate India’s growth while also making its redistributive policies more effective. Although India provides the specifics for their arguments, their analysis and prescriptions would apply to many other countries, as well.

This ambitious book provides one of the best accounts yet of this grand transformation of the global political order, driven by the explosive appeal of nationalism and self-rule. As nation-states grew in legitimacy and mobilized ever more power, other types of polities could not compete. Wimmer’s major contribution is to demonstrate how the spread of the nation-state generated violence and war. Marshaling carefully assembled quantitative evidence, Wimmer shows that the incidence of war more than doubled once nationalism gained a foothold in world politics and triggered violent struggles over borders, ethnicity, and self-determination. In a surprise, Wimmer does not find any evidence that democracies are more peaceful than autocracies, arguing that peace results less from the qualities of any particular system and more from the establishment of inclusive governments and the depoliticization of ethnicity.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

Mandel believes that security and governance are shifting from public to private hands. In many countries, armed nonstate groups share power with central governments; Afghanistan, Lebanon, and Libya are a few prominent examples. Mandel’s claim is that at least in some instances, armed nonstate groups can contribute to stability and that efforts to bolster central governments only lead to more violence and instability. The book finds that private armed groups can gain a comparative advantage in troubled places by guaranteeing the physical safety and humanitarian needs of endangered groups. The book’s insights are useful, although most of the cases Mandel cites involve controversial groups (such as Hezbollah in Lebanon) and offer decidedly mixed evidence.

Nearly 30 years later, with the rise of China worrying the West, Rosecrance again urges the United States to pursue a grand strategy of trade and economic integration, this time focused on the creation of a massive economic union with Europe. It is no longer enough to be a trading state, Rosecrance asserts. What the old Western industrial powers need now is an open market of sufficient scale and scope to increase their efficiency and stability. A giant customs union would generate additional growth and would allow the West to approach China and other Asian countries from a position of strength. The book lacks a systematic explanation of precisely how high-growth Asian economies threaten the United States and Europe.

Meanwhile, authoritarian states, such as China and Russia, have tightened their grips. Kurlantzick struggles to identify the precise causes of this global democratic recession. The slowing or reversal of economic growth is at fault, but so, too, are the more general travails of modernity: economic inequality, weak social welfare systems, disease, urbanization, environmental degradation, and migration. Those factors give autocrats and authoritarians short-term advantages in winning the support of fearful middle-class constituencies. The book is convincing in diagnosing the troubled state of democracy, rooted in its failure to reliably deliver shared prosperity and economic security. But it is less convincing in arguing that nondemocracies will ultimately fair any better or establish their authority and legitimacy as alternative models of political rule.

But another issue is far more pressing. For at least the next decade, while China remains relatively weak compared to the United States, there is a real danger that Beijing and Washington will find themselves in a crisis that could quickly escalate to military conflict. Unlike a long-term great-power strategic rivalry that might or might not develop down the road, the danger of a crisis involving the two nuclear-armed countries is a tangible, near-term concern -- and the events of the past few years suggest the risk might be increasing."

How, they ask, can a communist dictatorship and a capitalist democracy bridge the gap between them? But it is time to stop thinking that the two countries come from different planets and that the tensions between them are the product of their differences.

For almost two decades, the country has been roiled by a series of wars involving neighboring countries and dozens of Congolese militias. Recent years seemed to bring some respite; in 2009, following a peace deal between the Congolese and the Rwandan governments, some of the main armed groups in eastern Congo joined the national government. But this agreement, like previous ones, soon succumbed to its flaws. Since April 2012, violence has once again begun to escalate, centered on a new rebellion in the eastern highlands led by the March 23 Movement, or the M23 (the group takes its name from the date of the signing of the 2009 peace accord, which it contends the government has not respected). There are now 2.6 million people displaced in Congo, over 30 different armed groups, and thousands of killings and rapes each year. The UN has deployed one of its largest peacekeeping missions there, and half a dozen peace processes and agreements have failed to bring an end to the fighting."
53,Petroleum to the People,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/africa/2013-08-12/petroleum-people,Petroleum to the People,"In October 2011, the U.S. Department of Justice filed a motion to seize a palatial cliff-top home in Malibu, California. The 16-acre property towers over its neighbors, with a palm-lined driveway leading to a plaster-and-tile mansion. Situated in the heart of one of the United States’ most expensive neighborhoods, the $30 million estate includes a swimming pool, a tennis court, and a four-hole golf course. In its complaint, the Justice Department also set its sights on high-performance speedboats worth $2 million, over two dozen cars (including a $2 million Maserati and eight Ferraris), and $3.2 million in Michael Jackson memorabilia -- in total, assets equaling approximately $71 million. What made these extravagant possessions all the more remarkable was that they belonged to a government worker from a small African country who was making an official salary of about $80,000 a year: Teodoro Nguema Obiang Mangue, the oldest son of and heir apparent to Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, the longtime president of Equatorial Guinea."
54,The Rise of the Rest of India,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/india/2013-08-12/rise-rest-india,The Rise of the Rest of India,"When Nitish Kumar became chief minister of the dirt-poor Indian state of Bihar in 2005, kidnapping was said to be the leading industry in the capital city of Patna. People searching for stolen cars were advised to check the driveway of a leading politician, who reportedly commandeered vehicles for “election duty.” Although known for his soft-spoken manner, Kumar cracked down hard. He straightened out the crooked police, ordering them to move aggressively against all criminals, from the daylight robbers to the corrupt high officials. He set up a new fast-track court to speed the miscreants to jail. As Biharis gained the courage to go out on the street, even after dark, Kumar set about energizing a landlocked economy with few outlets for manufactured exports. He focused on improving the yields of Bihar’s fertile soil and ushered in a construction boom. Within a few years, a state once described by the writer V. S. Naipaul as “the place where civilization ends” had built one of the fastest-growing state economies in India. And Kumar was recognized as a leader in the new generation of dynamic chief ministers who are remaking the economic map and future of India."
55,The Limits of Counterinsurgency Doctrine in Afghanistan,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/afghanistan/limits-counterinsurgency-doctrine-afghanistan,The Limits of Counterinsurgency Doctrine in Afghanistan,"Since 9/11, two consecutive U.S. administrations have labored mightily to help Afghanistan create a state inhospitable to terrorist organizations with transnational aspirations and capabilities. The goal has been clear enough, but its attainment has proved vexing. Officials have struggled to define the necessary attributes of a stable post-Taliban Afghan state and to agree on the best means for achieving them. This is not surprising. The U.S. intervention required improvisation in a distant, mountainous land with de jure, but not de facto, sovereignty; a traumatized and divided population; and staggering political, economic, and social problems. Achieving even minimal strategic objectives in such a context was never going to be quick, easy, or cheap."
56,Ending the War in Afghanistan,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/afghanistan/2013-08-12/ending-war-afghanistan,Ending the War in Afghanistan,"International forces in Afghanistan are preparing to hand over responsibility for security to Afghan soldiers and police by the end of 2014. U.S. President Barack Obama has argued that battlefield successes since 2009 have enabled this transition and that with it, “this long war will come to a responsible end.” But the war will not end in 2014. The U.S. role may end, in whole or in part, but the war will continue—and its ultimate outcome is very much in doubt."
57,Who Is Ali Khamenei?,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/iran/2013-08-12/who-ali-khamenei,Who Is Ali Khamenei?,"In June, Hassan Rouhani was elected president of the Islamic Republic of Iran. Rouhani ran as a reform candidate, and many have interpreted his victory as a harbinger of a possible liberalization or rationalization of Iranian domestic and foreign policy. But the dominant figure in Iranian politics is not the president but rather the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. The Iranian constitution endows the supreme leader with tremendous authority over all major state institutions, and Khamenei, who has held the post since 1989, has found many other ways to further increase his influence. Formally or not, the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of the government all operate under his absolute sovereignty; Khamenei is Iran’s head of state, commander in chief, and top ideologue. His views are what will ultimately shape Iranian policy, and so it is worth exploring them in detail."
58,How Big Business Can Save the Climate,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/commons/2013-08-12/how-big-business-can-save-climate,How Big Business Can Save the Climate,"In September 1987, representatives of 24 countries met in Montreal and accomplished a rare feat in international politics: a successful environmental accord. The Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, which UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan later called “perhaps the single most successful international agreement to date,” set the ambitious goal of phasing out chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and other dangerous chemicals. It worked: by 1996, developed countries had stopped their production and consumption of CFCs, and by 2006, the 191 countries that had ratified the protocol had eliminated 95 percent of global ozone-depleting emissions."
59,David Cameron’s Dangerous Game,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/western-europe/2013-09-01/david-cameron-s-dangerous-game,David Cameron’s Dangerous Game,"Despite his innate caution and usually sound political instincts, British Prime Minister David Cameron is gambling with his country’s future. In January, in a long-anticipated speech, he called for a wide-ranging renegotiation of the terms of the United Kingdom’s membership in the European Union and promised to put the result up for a straight in-or-out popular referendum by the end of 2017 (assuming his party wins the next election, due in 2015). A British exit from the EU is now more likely than ever -- and it would be disastrous not only for the United Kingdom but also for the rest of Europe and the United States."
60,The Importance of Being Civil: The Struggle for Political Decency,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2013-08-21/importance-being-civil-struggle-political-decency,The Importance of Being Civil: The Struggle for Political Decency,"Many see civility as a sensible but superficial quality of people and groups that although divided by class, culture, or political ideology can nevertheless agree to disagree. But Hall finds a deeper idea about the importance of being civil embedded in the Western liberal tradition. Civil society flourishes not when differences are eliminated but when people decide to live together with a richness of diversity. Hall notes that there are limits to how diverse a stable and well-functioning society can be: some minimal agreement must exist over certain essentials, such as respect for the rule of law and an abhorrence of violence. Nonetheless, what Hall calls the “civilized acceptance of difference” is an essential precondition if liberal societies are to endure in a world fractured by class, religion, race, and national identity. Hall shows that the enemies of civility have often had the upper hand, a fact reflected in the West’s violent history of imperialism, war, and ethnic cleansing. Political orders of toleration are not unique to the West, Hall makes clear, as India’s remarkable society demonstrates. But China’s conception of a more homogeneous national identity is less promising."
61,Africa’s Turn,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/interviews/2013-06-26/africas-turn,Africa’s Turn,"Since it gained independence from France in 1960, the West African country of Senegal has been a bastion of stability and democracy on a continent that has seen relatively little of either. During the presidency of Abdoulaye Wade (2000–2012), however, the Senegalese exception seemed under threat. The elderly Wade grew increasingly authoritarian and corrupt, and he managed to run for a third term even though the constitution prohibited him from doing so. But in March 2012, Senegalese voters dealt Wade a decisive defeat, electing the reformist candidate Macky Sall instead. Trained in France as a geological engineer, Sall had served in a number of government posts under Wade, including prime minister, before publicly breaking with him in 2007. In opposition, Sall created a new political party; served a second term as mayor of his hometown, Fatick; and organized an anti-Wade coalition. Sall spoke with Foreign Affairs senior editor Stuart Reid in Dakar in June, days before U.S. President Barack Obama’s arrival in Senegal for a state visit."
62,Can Washington Win Over the Arab Street?,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/middle-east/2013-06-11/can-washington-win-over-arab-street,Can Washington Win Over the Arab Street?,"In my book Of Empires and Citizens, I argue that at the height of the period of authoritarian rule in the Middle East, Arab societies were divided between those people who benefited from their leaders’ relationship with the United States, and therefore sought to preserve the dictatorships, and those who did not, and therefore sought democracy. For the pro-U.S. camp, which was mostly comprised of the affluent, the U.S.-backed regimes brought the stability necessary for economic growth. This group feared that democracy, which could bring to power anti-American Islamists, would weigh the economy down. The other camp, meanwhile, saw the United States as the primary underwriter of repression. This dynamic made Middle Eastern autocracies extremely durable: in the Arab world, the middle class, which tends to be the vanguard of democracy elsewhere, was at best ambivalent to rule by the people."

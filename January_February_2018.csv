0,The Undead Past,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/issue-packages/2017-12-12/undead-past,What’s Inside,"How do nations handle the sins of the fathers and mothers? Take genocide, or slavery, or political mass murder. After such knowledge, what forgiveness—and what way forward? The Germans have a word for it, of course: Vergangenheitsbewältigung, or “coming to terms with the past.” But the concept is applicable far beyond the Nazis—as Americans belatedly recognized when Robert E. Lee shot to the front of the culture wars last August after the riots in Charlottesville, Virginia."
1,From Nazism to Never Again,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/western-europe/2017-12-12/nazism-never-again,From Nazism to Never Again,"Defeated regimes are not only swiftly removed from power but often immediately erased from memory as well. When Adolf Hitler’s “thousand-year German Reich” came crashing down in 1945 with the Allied victory in World War II, reminders of the 12 years of its actual existence were hastily scrubbed away as Germans scrambled to adjust to life after Nazism. Stone swastikas were chiseled off the façades of buildings, Nazi insignia were taken down from flagpoles, and, in towns and cities across Germany, streets and squares named after Hitler reverted to their previous designations."
2,Let Women Work,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2017-12-12/let-women-work,Let Women Work,"In June, Saudi Arabia will make it legal for women to drive, marking the end of one of the world’s most conspicuous examples of gender discrimination. The ban’s removal has been rightly hailed as a victory in a country that systematically limits women’s freedoms. But for Saudi officials, this policy reversal has more to do with economics than concern for women’s rights. In recent years, even culturally conservative countries such as the Gulf kingdom have begun to recognize that they cannot get ahead if they leave half of their human capital behind."
3,Police in Africa: The Street Level View,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2017-12-12/police-africa-street-level-view,Police in Africa: The Street Level View,"Because maintaining law and order is such a vital function of the state, studying policing can reveal clues about the nature of a country’s government. In its better chapters, this collection of insightful ethnographic studies of policing in sub-Saharan Africa details the accomplishments and limits of state building in the region. Police organizations there continue to be shaped by colonial-era institutions but demonstrate surprisingly strong norms of professionalism, even as individual police officers struggle to perform their jobs with limited means in increasingly dangerous environments. Well-organized police bureaucracies have formed in recent decades, but various forms of bribery and corruption remain extremely common, and inadequate skill levels persist. A fascinating chapter by Beek deconstructs the practices at a police checkpoint in Ghana, where officers will ignore multiple infractions if a citizen offers them a small gift. This ritual follows long-standing local norms, but the behavior of individual police officers is increasingly shaped by worries that people will complain about them on local radio stations, which may result in social sanctions, as well as an official reprimand."
4,Radio Okapi Kindu: The Station That Helped Bring Peace to the Congo; A Memoir,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2017-12-12/radio-okapi-kindu-station-helped-bring-peace-congo-memoir,Radio Okapi Kindu: The Station That Helped Bring Peace to the Congo; A Memoir,"In 2004, Bakody spent nine months in Kindu, a provincial capital in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, managing a radio station set up by the UN peacekeeping force at a time when the country’s civil war, which originally began in 1996, appeared to be winding down. (In fact, it has still yet to fully end.) She has written a deeply affecting memoir of her time there, one that details the enormous difficulties faced by journalists in poor, war-torn regions with great empathy. The usual problem with this type of book is that it places too much attention on the foreign narrator and too little on the local people. But Bakody inserts herself in the story mostly to deprecate her own experience and knowledge and emphasizes instead her local colleagues, who made the radio station a success—often at great personal sacrifice and risk. One dramatic highlight is the brilliantly understated account that one of Bakody’s colleagues gives of how he was brutally beaten by soldiers in retaliation for a story he wrote about the army’s poor performance in battle. Thanks to Bakody’s talent for snappy dialogue, eye for detail, and humorous prose, the book never flags, even when its pace slows down to capture the everyday slog of running a radio station."
5,Boko Haram: The History of an African Jihadist Movement,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2017-12-12/boko-haram-history-african-jihadist-movement,Boko Haram: The History of an African Jihadist Movement,"A number of solid journalistic accounts of the rise of Boko Haram have appeared in recent years, but Thurston’s scholarly work stands out and deserves a wide readership. It offers an authoritative take on the group’s murky origins and wisely situates its rise within the context of Nigerian political history. In particular, Thurston’s account links the divisions and lively debates within Nigerian Islam in the 1970s and 1980s to the radical anti-Western views developed by Boko Haram’s first leader and ideologue, Mohammed Yusuf. Thurston also discusses the regionalization of the emergency created by Boko Haram’s assault, which has now spread to Cameroon, Chad, and Niger, places where the jihadists launched several hundred armed attacks in 2016 alone. Thurston’s most troubling argument is that the Nigerian state’s intensely repressive response to Boko Haram has served only to further radicalize the organization. Where this otherwise superb book falls short, however, is in its vague call to pursue a political solution that would involve governmental negotiations with Boko Haram."
6,"Another Fine Mess: America, Uganda, and the War on Terror",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2017-12-12/another-fine-mess-america-uganda-and-war-terror,"Another Fine Mess: America, Uganda, and the War on Terror","Epstein joins a number of other critics of current U.S. policy in Africa in noting that the “war on terror” has led Washington to sharply increase military assistance to the region, emphasize stability over democracy, and tacitly or explicitly support dictators. Epstein focuses her criticism on Washington’s relationship with the regime of Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni, who has been in power since the mid-1980s. For decades, Museveni has received massive amounts of U.S. support, all in the name of containing Islamist regimes in nearby Somalia and Sudan. In Epstein’s telling, Museveni has manipulated Washington to maintain his own rapacious rule and has exported instability throughout Uganda’s neighborhood. Epstein thus partly blames the United States for the civil wars in Somalia and South Sudan and for the 1994 genocide in Rwanda and the long-running conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which she suggests would not have happened without U.S. support of Museveni. It is worth asking whether the Americans have given a blank check to their Ugandan ally, and Epstein has produced an often troubling indictment of U.S. policy. But her book tends to exaggerate the influence of both Uganda and the United States in shaping the area’s awful recent history."
7,"A Moonless, Starless Sky: Ordinary Women and Men Fighting Extremism in Africa",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2017-12-12/moonless-starless-sky-ordinary-women-and-men-fighting-extremism,"A Moonless, Starless Sky: Ordinary Women and Men Fighting Extremism in Africa","Avoiding standard reportorial clichés about Africa, Okeowo, a Nigerian American journalist, narrates four stories about ordinary people thrust into extraordinary circumstances. One story describes the oddly resilient relationship between two young Ugandans kidnapped by the Lord’s Resistance Army: a man forced to fight for the group and an abducted woman whom its leaders assigned to be the man’s sex slave—and who now live together as husband and wife after having separately escaped the militants’ clutches. Another describes a young Somali woman who pursues her passion for basketball in war-torn Mogadishu despite receiving death threats from radical Islamists. A third portrays the life of a modern-day slave in rural Mauritania and then profiles the work of a Mauritanian abolitionist. And a final tale revolves around a young Nigerian girl who escaped after being kidnapped by the jihadists of Boko Haram and a middle-aged man who leads a group of citizens fighting against them. Okeowo masterfully fleshes out her subjects, allowing them to come alive on the page while also capturing the complexities of contemporary African societies. She never holds back on the brutal details, yet the reader comes away somehow more sanguine about the region."
8,"Hard Target: Sanctions, Inducements, and the Case of North Korea",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2017-12-12/hard-target-sanctions-inducements-and-case-north-korea,"Hard Target: Sanctions, Inducements, and the Case of North Korea","Both of the main strategies that the major powers and international institutions have employed to deal with North Korea—sanctions and engagement—are based on an economic logic that the authors of this rigorous analysis believe to be flawed. Such policies were supposed to work by hurting or helping the general population—but the public’s welfare is of little concern to Pyongyang’s leaders. When punishments or payoffs were narrowed to target the core group of leaders, they found ways of passing the suffering to the people. When carrots were offered along with sticks, they took them without making policy changes. Moreover, both strategies were vulnerable to the lack of coordination among Pyongyang’s negotiating and trading partners. Haggard and Noland substantiate their arguments with empirical data on North Korea’s authoritarian political structure, autarkic policies, opportunistic and often illicit foreign trade, and ability to wring aid and investment not only from China but also from South Korea. They use a survey of Chinese and South Korean firms doing business with North Korea to show that engagement does not increase marketization; it plays into the hands of Pyongyang’s state enterprises. The authors’ analysis provides many reasons to doubt that the enhanced sanctions regime recently put in place will bring North Korea to the negotiating table."

Having served as a correspondent in all three capitals, he has a sharp eye for personalities and policy factions, as well as a firm grasp of geopolitics. His fascinating narrative of the three countries’ relations over 50 years is filled with fresh anecdotes drawn from interviews and newly released archival documents. From the outside, the shape of the relationships appears fixed, with Tokyo and Washington lined up firmly against Beijing. But McGregor’s close analysis reveals a constant fluidity. Flinty realism has usually driven trilateral diplomacy, but in McGregor’s view, no factor has done more to sustain the shape of the triangle than Japan’s inability to allay Chinese resentment over the depredations of the 1930s and 1940s. At a moment when U.S. President Donald Trump is challenging the U.S. relationship with both Asian powers, McGregor warns that a breakdown in the U.S.-Japanese alliance could lead to a three-way free-for-all that would force Japan to develop nuclear weapons."
10,Red at Heart: How Chinese Communists Fell in Love With the Russian Revolution,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2017-12-12/red-heart-how-chinese-communists-fell-love-russian-revolution,Red at Heart: How Chinese Communists Fell in Love With the Russian Revolution,"Thousands of Chinese Communists went to Moscow in the 1920s and 1930s to learn from the Soviet Union. Moved by revolutionary idealism and liberationist sexual ideas, many fell in love, some with each other and others (especially the men) with Russians. These Moscow-born relationships flourished while the two countries were allied and suffered when they split. One sojourner, Chiang Ching-kuo, married a Russian woman and later became president of Taiwan. McGuire presents a richly researched set of personal stories, involving both the lovers and their children, nested within a larger political story. Today, Chinese President Xi Jinping is striving to resurrect the selfless “party spirit” of a mythical golden age. As Xi extols the supposed virtues of that era, Chinese would do well to remember the chaotic personal lives of those who built the Chinese Communist Party in the first place."
11,Islam and Democracy in Indonesia: Tolerance Without Liberalism,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2017-12-12/islam-and-democracy-indonesia-tolerance-without-liberalism,Islam and Democracy in Indonesia: Tolerance Without Liberalism,"Indonesia is famed for its tolerant style of Islam, but Menchik argues that it would be a mistake to assume that this has any bearing on the country’s views of Western-style liberal democracy, in which religious faith is a matter of individual choice. Rather, under Indonesian law, every citizen must belong to one of six recognized religions or suffer certain disadvantages. Nor is the state secular: state schools teach religion, proselytizing is forbidden, and blasphemy is a crime. Menchik polled leaders of the two biggest Muslim organizations and found that they are willing to accept Christians and Hindus in public office because they regard their religions as legitimate, but they are unlikely to accept Ahmadis (who adhere to an offshoot of Islam), animists, or atheistic communists in government. His revealing research into local history shows how the diverse experiences of different Muslim organizations have produced a wide range of beliefs about religious tolerance and even about what a belief system has to look like in order to be counted as a religion. Since the concept of tolerance varies so much among Indonesian Muslims, the public as a whole could become more tolerant over time or, as seems to be happening now, less so."
12,Liberalism Disavowed: Communitarianism and State Capitalism in Singapore,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2017-12-12/liberalism-disavowed-communitarianism-and-state-capitalism,Liberalism Disavowed: Communitarianism and State Capitalism in Singapore,"This penetrating account of the Singapore model by a senior Singaporean sociologist explains both why the model works and why it is not transferable to other countries. Chua describes the government’s use of the legal system to repress dissent, its public housing program that depends on coercive land acquisition and government manipulation of the housing market, its system of profitable state-owned enterprises that makes many residents employees of the state, and its assignment of every citizen to one of four constructed “race” categories in order to regulate relations among ethnic communities. Contrary to the conventional wisdom, he argues that neither repression nor a cultural preference for authoritarianism explains the regime’s success; rather, the state’s successful policies—rooted in social democratic ideology and meritocratic leadership—and the island nation’s strategic vulnerability explain why the population has accepted an elitist, repressive system for over 50 years and why it will probably continue to do so. Some of Singapore’s techniques can be emulated abroad, such as its methods of city planning. But the model as a whole is tailored too closely to the specific features of Singaporean society to be replicable elsewhere."
13,Cold War Monks: Buddhism and America’s Secret Strategy in Southeast Asia,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2017-12-12/cold-war-monks-buddhism-and-americas-secret-strategy-southeast,Cold War Monks: Buddhism and America’s Secret Strategy in Southeast Asia,"Throughout the Cold War, the CIA, working through the Asia Foundation, tried to use Buddhism in Burma (now also called Myanmar), Cambodia, Ceylon (now known as Sri Lanka), Laos, Thailand, and Vietnam as a bulwark against communism. With access to Asia Foundation archives and deep research into Thai archival sources, Ford tells the intricate story of this unsuccessful effort. Washington competed with China for influence in the World Fellowship of Buddhists, but the organization never had much impact. In Vietnam, Buddhists turned against the U.S.-backed, Catholic-led Diem government and its successors. In Thailand, the foundation tried to draw the monkhood out of its traditional political quietism and into community development projects. But what arose instead was a violently antiprogressive Buddhist movement that encouraged the assassination of leftists as a way to earn religious merit. Politicizing the monks contributed to the polarization that bedevils Thai politics today."
14,Myanmar’s Enemy Within: Buddhist Violence and the Making of a Muslim “Other”,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2017-12-12/myanmars-enemy-within-buddhist-violence-and-making-muslim-other,Myanmar’s Enemy Within: Buddhist Violence and the Making of a Muslim “Other”,"Wade’s probing reportage exposes the historical and cultural roots of the Rohingya crisis in Myanmar (also known as Burma), in which an army crackdown has forced hundreds of thousands of members of the Muslim ethnic minority to flee to neighboring Bangladesh. He shows that the tragedy is only the latest phase of Myanmar’s long historical effort to cope with ethnic and religious diversity by defining Burmese identity as ethnically Bamar and religiously Buddhist while denying full citizenship to minorities. The Rohingya and the neighboring ethnic Rakhine group—also a minority, but Buddhist—have exchanged acts of violence for decades, leading to the isolation of the Rohingya population in virtual concentration camps. A partial transition to democracy that began in 2012 intensified anxieties about the power balance among ethnic groups and unleashed a Buddhist fundamentalist movement that sees Islam as a threat to the very survival of the Bamar and a danger to Buddhism throughout Southeast Asia. This is a deeply insightful work on the dynamics of ethnic violence."
15,Revolution Without Revolutionaries: Making Sense of the Arab Spring,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2017-12-12/revolution-without-revolutionaries-making-sense-arab-spring,Revolution Without Revolutionaries: Making Sense of the Arab Spring,"Bayat is an expert on social movements. His book draws intellectual inspiration from the ideologically charged era in his native Iran that preceded the fall of the shah in 1979, a time when anticolonialism, hard-left socialism, and militant Islamism all enjoyed robust support. He laments the fact that the Arab world’s moment of revolt—the uprisings of 2010–11—largely lacked revolutionary ideology. He argues that the dissidents behind the so-called Arab Spring were co-opted and doomed by neoliberalism (the resort to markets to solve distributional issues) and thus wound up producing mere “refolutions,” watered down by reformist impulses and ideas. His exploration of the Arab revolts fails to account for secular dissidents’ inability to organize ahead of elections. He makes much of what he calls “nonmovements”: informal groups on the margins of the political system that he sees as harbingers of the next revolutions. “Revolution occurs when there is no other way out,” he avers. But there always is another way out: exiting the system altogether, which is precisely what many groups have done."
16,A Social Revolution: Politics and the Welfare State in Iran,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2017-12-12/social-revolution-politics-and-welfare-state-iran,A Social Revolution: Politics and the Welfare State in Iran,"This empirically rich study draws on Harris’ extensive fieldwork in Iran and uses welfare policy as a prism through which to view the country’s transition from the shah’s dictatorship to the now nearly 40-year-old theocracy of the Islamic Republic. He debunks the notion that social welfare in a rentier economy such as Iran’s, which depends on petroleum revenues, is part of an authoritarian bargain in which citizens offer docility in exchange for benefits. Instead, welfare policies have mobilized whole sectors of Iranian society, fostered political agency for new groups (including women), and driven political elites in directions they may not have foreseen. Harris asserts that in the wake of the Iran-Iraq War, Iranian conservatives and reformers alike developed a commitment to a technocratic “developmental state” on the model of South Korea or Taiwan, in which public authorities interfere in markets and promote favored industries and sectors. This consensus has led to the extension of social programs such as welfare and subsidies for fuel and university tuition to educated middle-class Iranians, who have come to see access to such benefits as a right. If Harris is correct, the Islamic Republic contains the seeds of its own transformation."

She grew up near the Jersey Shore in the 1980s and was raised on the myth that the United States is a shining “city upon a hill,” a benevolent power that labors to elevate other countries to its lofty height. Hansen, a writer for The New York Times Magazine, has lived in Istanbul since 2007, and during her time there—as well as on reporting trips to places such as Afghanistan, Egypt, Greece, and Iran—the scales have fallen from her eyes. She writes well—at times grippingly—about these places. But the end result is a caricature. She attributes no redeeming features to the United States or to Americans. Inspired by her muse James Baldwin (who also lived in Istanbul for a time), she sees Americans as emotionally impoverished. In Hansen’s view, every U.S. action overseas is suffused with an underlying racism and almost always accompanied by violence, and any U.S. gain inevitably comes at the expense of the rest of the world. In her portrait, the American beast is so overpowering that other people and societies seem stripped of all responsibility for their own conditions."
18,Realism and Democracy: American Foreign Policy After the Arab Spring,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2017-12-12/realism-and-democracy-american-foreign-policy-after-arab-spring,Realism and Democracy: American Foreign Policy After the Arab Spring,"Abrams’ experience in U.S. foreign policy stretches back to the Reagan years, but he is best known as a neoconservative who advised President George W. Bush. In the fascinating introduction to this book, Abrams traces his intellectual development and explores the roots of his worldview. He presents U.S. foreign policy as a Manichaean realm, split between leaders committed to spreading and strengthening democracy and human rights (Ronald Reagan, Bush) and those who believe such concerns to be peripheral to U.S. strategic interests (Richard Nixon, Henry Kissinger, Barack Obama). Abrams’ view makes sense only if one embraces the idea of U.S. exceptionalism—or at least believes that, on balance, the United States is a force for good in the world. Abrams forcefully rejects the argument that the so-called war on terror compels Washington to countenance Arab autocracies that join in the fight. To the contrary, he points out, the autocracies fuel the extremism that in turn drives terrorism. Abrams implies that Bush understood this and thus put pressure on Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to reform, whereas Obama turned on Mubarak only after massive protests broke out in Cairo in 2011—and then did little as Mubarak’s eventual successor, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, ramped up repression after taking power in a military coup in 2013. On this point, Abrams and some of his liberal critics may well agree."
19,Jihad & Co.: Black Markets and Islamist Power,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2017-12-12/jihad-co-black-markets-and-islamist-power,Jihad & Co.: Black Markets and Islamist Power,"This book is one of a kind, and so is its author. Ahmad is a female Muslim scholar born into a family of smugglers in Peshawar, Pakistan, who has engaged in extensive field research in two of the most dangerous places on earth: Afghanistan and Somalia. She offers a simple and compelling hypothesis regarding the relationship between business elites and jihadists. Anarchy of the type that prevails in Afghanistan and Somalia raises the costs of doing business and shrinks profits margins. By embracing Islam, sincerely or strategically, and cooperating with jihadists, businesspeople help construct a sort of “moral” black market in smuggled goods, in which actors voluntarily comply with contracts. In turn, jihadists turn to businesspeople and smugglers for contributions—rather than extorting them, as secular warlords usually do. By financially supporting jihadists such as the Afghan Taliban and the Somali Islamic Courts Union, businesses help the extremists corner the market on the provision of security and thus help them create proto-states. This analysis is anchored by Ahmad’s solid grounding in the political economy of civil war and state building. Ahmad extends her analysis to Iraq, Pakistan, Syria, and the Sahel region, where “conflicts appear to be driven by ideas and identities” but where, in reality, “everyone is talking about money.” Ahmad also explains when and why alliances between businesspeople and jihadists erode, and what that means for combating terrorist groups."

He arrived in 1956, fresh from the classroom, wide-eyed and inexperienced, just before Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev delivered his “secret speech” denouncing Stalin. After Khrushchev’s thunderbolt, the so-called year of the thaw that followed allowed Kalb to travel to many parts of the country. His account of his stray meetings and impromptu friendships in Central Asia, Ukraine, and ancient Russian cities provides a vivid, sometimes moving portrait of Soviet society in that jarring year. Most affecting is his tale of the old man he met by chance in the then rundown Podol district of Kiev. The man remembered Kalb’s grandfather, who took his family to the United States in 1914. Back at a Harvard after his year of service in Moscow ended, Kalb was interrupted from work on his dissertation by a call from Edward R. Murrow: the first step in what would become a distinguished three-decade career as a journalist at CBS and NBC."

Here, Blobaum provides the first full-length English-language account of the city’s experience of World War I. Once the Germans occupied the city, in August 1915, an economic crisis that had begun in the first year of the war, while Warsaw was still under Russian rule, considerably worsened. As a result, the hardships of the city’s Polish and Jewish populations achieved levels rivaling what they would later suffer in the next world war, a comparison that Blobaum explores in some detail. He traces the war’s tightening grip on the economy, the swelling unemployment, the growing health crisis, the influx of refugees and wounded soldiers, and the tensions these hardships generated between the Polish and Jewish communities. He also narrates the city’s cultural twists and turns—the cabarets, cinemas, and seamy nightlife—as well as the war’s more positive contributions, such as the growth of voluntary associations and, in particular, the transformation of women’s place in society."

From 1991 to 2004, the period the book focuses on, Pifer served in a number of senior U.S. State Department and White House positions dealing with Ukraine, including as U.S. ambassador from 1998 to 2000. Every step of the way, relations were complicated and often frustrating for both sides. Pifer explores the history with dispassionate insight, beginning with the United States’ single-minded effort to get nuclear weapons out of Ukraine (too single-minded, in his estimation) and continuing on to the complications introduced by Ukraine’s vexed and often bitter relations with Russia and to the dashed hopes for economic and political reform. Looking back, he offers reflections on what the United States did right (navigating the complex process of removing nuclear weapons from Ukraine) and what it did wrong (frequently being oblivious to the intricacies of Ukrainian politics). He concludes the book with an analysis of the years since 2004, to which he brings similar lucidity and cool detachment, and with recommendations for the future of U.S. policy toward this troubled country."

Some 107 communist parties operated worldwide, with a total membership of 82 million people. McAdams tells the story of how this movement grew out of the crucible of nineteenth-century Europe, flourished in the Soviet Union, and then spread to China, Cuba, and beyond. He starts with Marx and Engels, explaining how their revolutionary ideas triumphed over the other political and intellectual currents of their day. He then turns to Vladimir Lenin and the party he created, its early European offshoots, and the Comintern—which, for a time, allowed the movement to remain somewhat monolithic. This, however, is not merely descriptive history. McAdams wrestles with a more profound puzzle: How was it, given the failure of Marx’s prophecies, that his ideas continued to animate communist parties and eventually led them to power in 24 countries? McAdams points to the sense of historical destiny and transcendence that Marxism inspired and also to the qualities of the Communist Party: its arrogated primacy, the requirements it set for its members, its rigid mission. All of that depended, of course, on the leaders who forged the movement: Lenin, Joseph Stalin, Mao Zedong, and Fidel Castro."

But the question of how such rights develop has stirred academic debate for years. Because Russia vaulted from circumstances in which property rights had little meaning to an economy built around them, it offers fertile ground for testing different and often competing theories. No one has done that better—more rigorously, more creatively, and more thoroughly—than Frye has in this book. Using survey data reaching back to 2000, as well as interviews with more than 2,500 businesspeople, he examines whether and to what degree one’s ability to own, hold, and profit from a business depends on the balance of political leverage between owners and state agents; the integrity of institutions such as courts; the impact of social constructs, including reputation; and the strength of social norms, whether generated by ideology, religion, or culture. All these factors matter, but Frye illuminates with great care just when, why, and how they matter, situating his analysis within an extraordinarily broad range of relevant scholarship."

In exquisite detail, it covers the critical years of Stalinism, from the decision to storm the country, by collectivizing agriculture and imposing forced-draft industrialization, through the purges of the Great Terror, to the outbreak of World War II. Kotkin manages to provide authoritative answers to an extraordinary number of long-debated questions about this period, including: What was the impulse behind the terror? What calculus drove Soviet intervention in the Spanish Civil War? How intentional was the 1931–33 famine? And was Stalin caught by surprise when the Germans attacked in June 1941? Kotkin plumbs every critical juncture in the internal and external politics of Stalin’s Soviet Union at a level of detail that is mind-bending. In most books on Stalin and the system that he twisted to his desires, the reader glides from one event to the next, forming a general sense of the terrain. In Kotkin’s fascinating book, by contrast, a strong undertow of detail draws the reader deep into history’s flow, allowing him or her to perceive the connections between events and affording glimpses into the interactions among Stalin, his inner circle, and the many bit players who shaped this story."

The indigenous Taino chief Hatuey courageously resisted European domination in the sixteenth century. Hundreds of years later, Cubans launched a bloody struggle for independence from Spain, and Fidel Castro led a socialist revolution to purge the island of U.S. influence. Although the sovereignty thesis is powerful in its clarity, it arguably underestimates the island’s prolonged adherence first to Spain (which earned Cuba a reputation for imperial loyalty), then to the United States (which enjoyed the support of a prosperous Cuban middle class and not just a tiny capitalist elite), and later to the Soviet Union. As the sweeping narrative frequently suggests, full-blown autonomy may not be a genuine option for a small island state. Cuba Libre concludes with an empathetic and balanced discussion of the dilemmas facing Cuban society today."

At Huaca Prieta (Spanish for “dark mound”), multiple generations of kinship communities constructed impressive earthworks for their rituals and burials—leaving behind what the venerable anthropologist Dillehay labels “one of the most complex prepottery coastal sites” ever discovered. Using cutting-edge forensic tools, a large multinational, multidisciplinary team uncovered, in exquisite detail, the lives and times of these Neolithic people. The contributors to this engrossing book reveal that these ancient Andeans feasted mostly on seafood but eventually added cultivated maize and chili peppers to their rather healthy diets. Although lacking ceramics, their artistic talents surfaced in sophisticated cotton textiles, basket weavings, and decorated gourds. Dillehay’s speculations about Huaca Prieta’s social organization are also fascinating: the evidence suggests that the community was more networked than hierarchical and more cooperative and deliberative than competitive or violent, and that its members interacted in relative harmony with one another and with their evolving maritime and terrestrial ecosystems."
28,At a Crossroads: Higher Education in Latin America and the Caribbean,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2017-12-12/crossroads-higher-education-latin-america-and-caribbean,At a Crossroads: Higher Education in Latin America and the Caribbean,"Many Latin American countries took advantage of the economic boom that began at the beginning of this century to dramatically expand their institutions of higher education. In the past 17 years, this illuminating World Bank report reveals, some 2,300 new schools have opened, mostly in the private sector, offering 30,000 new programs. Across the region, average higher-education enrollment rates jumped from 21 percent in 2000 to 43 percent in 2013. Impressively, access for low- and middle-income students grew even more rapidly. Owing to the increased presence of lower-income students at colleges and universities, public spending on higher education is now skewed toward the disadvantaged—a reversal of previous distributions, which disproportionately benefited better-off families. Moreover, spending per student and student-faculty ratios in Latin American countries are now in line with those of the wealthy nations of Europe and North America. Not all is well, of course: drop-out rates remain too high; too many students attend low-quality, high-priced private universities; a deficit of graduates in science and engineering contributes to the region’s low rate of innovation; and academic research grants are often not subjected to the rigors of competitive selection. The authors’ proposed solutions include improving the dissemination of information on job-market prospects for graduates and reforming regulations and accreditation procedures."

Shachtman wants to give France its due. He demonstrates the depth of the French commitment by tracing the complex negotiations behind the Franco-American alliance. The rebellious American colonists first needed to overcome their deep mistrust of the French, whom they had fought a generation before in the French and Indian War. Then the rebels sent a team to Paris headed by Benjamin Franklin, who needed years to convince France to make its scarce resources available. Even after the alliance was formed, both sides remained ambivalent: the colonists feared that the French would quit, and the French mistrusted the (already) highly partisan American Continental Congress. Yet the alliance held. In the end, French assistance made the difference between defeat and victory. Ten percent of the casualties suffered by those fighting for the American cause were French. Paris provided essential financing to pay Washington’s soldiers; shipments of guns, artillery, and ammunition; technical and engineering expertise; diplomatic support; safe ports for American privateers; skilled battlefield leadership; and, of course, the fleet and army that ensured the decisive American victory at Yorktown in 1781."

Harper offers a striking reinterpretation with worrisome implications for the present day. Ancient Rome, he argues, succumbed to pandemic diseases. He documents the devastating spread of plague, tuberculosis, smallpox, and perhaps even Ebola in ancient Rome, which together killed more than half the population in some areas. He shows how the thousand-year-old empire grew vulnerable to such pathogens owing to severe Mediterranean climate change, extremely large cities, a vulnerable food chain, and its central position in vast networks of travel, trade, and migration. In making the case, Harper relies in part on fascinating new biomedical tools that are revolutionizing what is termed “paleomolecular archaeology.” Yet due to the fragility of many pathogens, his study also relies on the subtle interpretation of traditional written sources, including many religious texts. The lesson is clear. Today, we inhabit a global system with a very similar combination of climatologic disturbances, urbanization, less diverse diets, and globalization. Ancient history reveals the risks we run."

She builds her latest book around the claim that the pursuit of exotic foods drove centuries of British economic dominance. Pepper and other spices, cod, wheat, meat, tea, cocoa, sugar, rice, and other culinary delights, as well as drugs such as opium and tobacco, dominated British international trade. This interpretation is neither deep nor original, and it treads rather lightly over the dark sides of empire, including slavery and the suppression of industry outside the United Kingdom. Collingham even defends opium use in nineteenth-century China as a healthy habit. Yet she does show how much traditional English cuisine relies on imported commodities and tastes. The traditional Victorian Christmas table would be barren indeed without Chinese tea, New Zealand lamb, Jamaican rum, Portuguese port, West Indian sugar, North American wheat, and, to top it off, a plum pudding with dried fruits from a half-dozen foreign lands. Brexiteers, take note."

Reinares’ examination of that brutal attack may be the most thoroughly researched study of a European terrorist incident currently available to the public. Based on law enforcement records and media reports from a half-dozen countries, the book reconstructs the perpetrators’ background as petty criminals, their radicalization in prison, and the material benefits they gained from terrorism. They belonged to a sophisticated global network of al Qaeda–linked jihadists. Their ostensible motives ranged from simple retaliation for recent Spanish police crackdowns on a local al Qaeda cell to a surprisingly intense desire to exact revenge for the Christian conquest of Spain over five centuries ago. About a month after the attack, the seven main perpetrators detonated themselves to avoid police capture. But peripheral members of the conspiracy escaped to Iraq and eventually joined the Islamic State, or ISIS. The book closes by reminding readers that the transit systems in London, New York City, and other metropolitan areas remain at risk—and that the best way to combat the threat is to reinforce international coordination of intelligence and policing. This is a must-read for counterterrorism authorities and concerned citizens alike."

Goodhart identifies two basic groups in British society: “anywheres” and “somewheres.” The first group contains urban, mobile, relatively young, wealthy, and highly educated elites of various ethnicities. The second comprises older, more sedentary, poorer, and less educated provincials, almost all of whom are white. “Anywheres” dominate elite education, the financial services industry, major media outlets, and the government technocracy—all of which are clustered in and around London. “Somewheres,” by contrast, are spread throughout the rest of the United Kingdom, where they seek in vain to defend local traditions, national identity, and what they conceive of as decent lower- and middle-class family values. Goodhart’s political incorrectness lies in his sympathy with the latter group, against whom, he rightly argues, the cosmopolitan elite has stacked the educational, economic, and cultural deck. But sympathy gets one only so far; what “somewheres” need are solutions. They could embrace Euroskepticism with the hope that reducing immigration and limiting trade would benefit them. Yet the current British government has proved itself to be hardly egalitarian and, in any case, unrealistic in its hopes for Brexit. Or they could back socialist redistribution—yet that threatens to undermine forward-looking economic activity. Goodhart poses the right questions but doesn’t offer much in the way of answers. One wonders if his hopes for change stem more from nostalgia than from realism."

Leffler adds to the value of the collection with an introduction and a running commentary that situates these essays in his own intellectual development. He began, like many of his peers, as an enthusiastic adherent of the historian William Appleman Williams, who saw economic imperialism as the main driver of U.S. foreign policy. But Leffler gradually came to believe that the complexity of the U.S. political system made it impossible for any single factor to play such a large role. Although he never lost sight of the vital role that economic considerations play in U.S. politics, Leffler saw other perspectives and other actors contesting and frequently overruling the recommendations and proposals of important pro-business lobbies and leaders. His skillful essays reveal him to be a scholar who was honest and courageous enough to let himself be instructed by the facts that he found."
35,Grant,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2017-12-12/grant,Grant,"Ulysses S. Grant was a brilliant general and, as president, did more than any other American leader to defend the newly freed slaves of the South after the Civil War. Yet partly as a result of his own weaknesses and blind spots, and partly as a casualty of the pro-Southern historians who shaped public understanding of Reconstruction for more than a century, Grant lies almost forgotten in his grave. Chernow, one of the finest biographical writers in American history, has undertaken to remedy this historical injustice by explaining and rehabilitating Grant. The result is a triumph: a sympathetic but clear-eyed biography that will be the starting point for all future studies of this enigmatic man. One only wishes that Chernow had chosen to make this a two-volume account. Reconstruction is such a complex and poorly understood chapter in U.S. history that the story of Grant’s presidency is difficult to tell within the confines of a single volume, one that must also contain something close to a full history of the Civil War. This remains, however, a book that no serious student of U.S. history can afford to miss."

What Happened is readable and in places quite charming, but it is neither a literary masterpiece nor a work of overpowering political wisdom. It does, however, offer readers real insight into what moves Clinton. Her paradoxically liberating and frustrating experiences as a member of the first generation of American women allowed to compete in the professional arena—but disadvantaged by rules and assumptions from earlier times—made her feel like an underdog even as she scaled the political heights. To her, the 2016 campaign felt like a continuation of this uphill, unequal struggle, even as many voters saw her as the insider candidate, the establishment favorite running because it was “her turn.” Her campaign never resolved this tension; that failure helps explain why Trump is tweeting from the White House and Clinton has time to write books."

Essentially, Lilla wants to reopen the debate that broke out in the late 1960s between the “Old Left,” which emphasized class and economics and was rooted in classical socialist politics, and the “New Left,” which focused more on race and identity. The gap between working-class white voters and the Democratic Party that contributed to Trump’s election is, Lilla argues, the natural and inevitable consequence of the triumph of the New Left, which retreated from the world of mass politics to the groves of academia. Lilla’s sweeping summaries of major events and complex arguments sometimes seem glib, and he never really comes to grips with the connection between the decline of the industrial working class and the rise of the New Left. But his concern that the sometimes illiberal forms of identity politics appearing on the left can both provoke and enable illiberal forces on the right deserves serious consideration."

President Jimmy Carter’s secretary of defense was the brilliant but shy Harold Brown, always on top of his brief and looking for pragmatic solutions to the short-term crises and long-term policy dilemmas that faced the administration. This exhaustive study of Brown’s four years at the Pentagon is not for novices, but it does contain valuable accounts of all the critical debates that shaped the Carter era: how to control the defense budget, how to pursue strategic arms control, how to solve the Iran hostage crisis of 1979, and how to respond to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan that began that same year."

These include teenage Palestinian Twitter users who can convey the terror of living through Israeli bombardments of Gaza; a Ukrainian activist who uses Facebook to crowdsource funds and supplies for beleaguered Ukrainian forces fighting Russian-backed separatists; a former employee of a Russian “troll farm” who made up and spread false news; and Eliot Higgins, a former video-game obsessive who exposed Russian propaganda about the shooting down of a Malaysian civilian airliner over Ukraine in 2014. He also tells the story of officials, particularly in Israel and the United States, who have tried to match their opponents’ agility and ubiquity but have struggled to make government bureaucracies more responsive. This is a highly readable introduction to some big issues in contemporary war. Patrikarakos asks searching questions and never overstates his case. One idea emerges quite clearly, however: it remains difficult to win a narrative battle when losing a physical one."

Conant, Warrior Scientist","Two substantial biographies shed new light on the scientific breakthroughs that led to nuclear weapons and the massive organizational effort required to get the bombs ready to use in time during World War II. The Italian American physicist Enrico Fermi, one of the greatest scientists of his generation, was the master of the nuclear chain reaction, theorizing how it could come about and then presiding over the construction of the first nuclear reactor, in Chicago in 1942. James Conant was one of the most talented chemists of his generation but, at the age of 40, left the laboratory to become a reform-minded president of Harvard University. Having contributed to the development of chemical weapons during World War I, Conant saw before most others the likelihood of a war with Nazi Germany and recognized the vital part that science would play in it. As head of the National Defense Research Committee, he became the most important figure overseeing the U.S. atomic bomb program. Like Fermi, he was animated by the fear that the Germans would get the bomb first. After the war, both men opposed the progression from fission weapons to massively more destructive thermonuclear ones; both also lamented the humiliation of Robert Oppenheimer, the American scientist who headed the Los Alamos National Laboratory (where the Manhattan Project was mainly carried out) and who was treated cruelly when the U.S. government revoked his security clearance in 1954 over inflated concerns about his loyalty. Fermi returned to science after the war but was cut down by cancer at age 53. Conant became a public figure, regularly on call in Washington, and concluded his career by serving as U.S. ambassador to West Germany."

Their detailed knowledge of German military tactics and culture played a vital role in gathering information as U.S. forces fought to liberate Europe. Henderson tells this tale skillfully, through the stories of eight young men who faced Nazi persecution and then returned to a shattered Germany as officers of a victorious army. They survived a powerful set of experiences: facing persecution, being separated from their parents (most of whom died in the Holocaust), arriving in a new country, fighting in vicious battles, liberating concentration camps, and achieving a clear but poignant triumph. Henderson’s narrative never flags, with vivid descriptions of the men parachuting into France on D-Day, persuading captured German soldiers to hand over vital information during the Battle of the Bulge, and tracking down war criminals."

Yet there are wide regional and even local variations in the treatment of particular ailments, and a good deal of care is provided on the basis of traditional practice rather than scientific evidence of its effectiveness. The United States stands out among rich countries in resisting evidence-based medicine—not in theory, perhaps, but in practice. In this informative book, the authors, all political scientists, document this phenomenon and then consider why ordinary people, physicians, and politicians all resist public spending on research that would produce obvious benefits for everyone. In brief, there is no broad constituency for such programs, yet there is plenty of opposition from the pharmaceutical and other medical industries, which fear that weak evidence for their treatments’ effectiveness will reduce their sales. The medical community (and some segments of the public) also worry that a stricter emphasis on evidence-based approaches would lead to mandated treatments rather than merely better information, and would thus detract from the authority, autonomy, and status accorded to physicians."

In the thoughtful, ruminative essays collected and woven together here, he explains the deep tension between economic integration at the international level and democratic decision-making at the national level. Globalization can influence government decisions that affect a society’s character and economy to the clear disadvantage of some groups, a process that creates resentment and anger on the part of those who lose out. Such decisions, in Rodrik’s view, should not be dictated by a sometimes unwarranted faith in the efficiency of markets or the financial system. He distinguishes between liberal democracies and other countries and argues that the same trade rules should not apply to both groups: for example, democracies should be permitted to restrict imports from nondemocracies to compensate for the latter group’s lack of environmental or labor rules, which allows for lower costs and prices. The United States and European countries, meanwhile, should not try to foist their values on other countries through trade agreements."

The boom in oil and gas produced by fracking—the “windfall” of this informative book’s title—has placed a severe strain on Russia and the oil-producing countries of the Middle East but has benefited China, European states, and especially the United States. O’Sullivan explores the possibility that the new abundance in energy might replace the risk of a U.S.-Chinese rivalry for scarce resources with the opportunity to establish a cooperative arrangement between the two countries that could produce stability in energy markets around the world."

Such behavior was encouraged by an intellectual climate that favored financial deregulation and assumed that private-sector actors could judge risk better than regulators could. Bayoumi’s very useful history features villains but also heroes: the recessions produced by the crises could have been a lot worse if, for example, governments had not opted for fiscal and monetary stimulus. But Bayoumi emphasizes the role of intrinsic, structural flaws in the increasingly fragile international financial system, which he compares to the dysfunctional international political system that produced World War I, a conflict that few foresaw and no one wanted. He reminds readers that active participants in the financial system are typically playing with other people’s money. He worries about a relapse into crisis and ends his book with an epigram: “Beware of bankers proffering improvements.”"

Like most economists, Tirole focuses on the allocation of scarce resources—an issue that even affluent societies face—and on the fact that, for better or for worse, people tend to act according to incentives. The trick, he argues, is for policymakers to craft incentives that encourage socially desirable behavior, such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions."

As a scholar, activist, politician, and Australia’s minister for foreign affairs from 1988 to 1996, Evans has been a charismatic and indefatigable presence, rallying the forces of internationalism to work toward genocide prevention, conflict resolution, social justice, and nuclear disarmament. In this revealing, even heartwarming memoir, Evans looks back and reflects on the great issues that shaped his passions and defined his career. As foreign minister, Evans came to understand that Australian foreign policy was best advanced when tied to “good international citizenship.” As a “middle power,” Australia could advance its interests only in concert with others, building coalitions and finding ways to shape the global agenda. Working with the Canadian government, Evans helped conceive of the principle of “the responsibility to protect” civilian populations from genocide and crimes against humanity—a singular achievement. A blend of idealism and pragmatism gave Evans confidence in the idea that people can sometimes act on their enlightened interests and work toward the global good."

His call to make the world “safe for democracy” has inspired generations of American presidents and triggered debates about the precise nature of Wilsonian liberal internationalism and how it relates to American hegemony and U.S. military intervention. Before he became president, Wilson was a prolific writer and a leading American scholar of democratic government, and Smith’s major contribution is his reconstruction of Wilson’s thinking from his books, papers, speeches, and letters. What emerges is a portrait not of a crusader or a utopian but of a realistic liberal who understood the deep and slow-forming foundations of modern democratic rule. The book traces internationalism back to a “preclassical” era of the nineteenth century, to its Cold War “hegemonic” phase, and to what Smith sees as its “imperialist” phase, which began in the 1990s and reached its apotheosis with the Iraq war and President George W. Bush’s pledge to promote democracy “in every nation and culture, with the ultimate goal of ending tyranny in our world.” Smith’s message is that Wilson’s ideas have been repeatedly misinterpreted and misused. By reminding readers of what Wilson really said, Smith hopes to inform a more restrained and modest U.S. foreign policy."

R. R. Palmer’s The Age of the Democratic Revolution, published more than five decades ago, remains the classic account of this upheaval. These two massive new histories are worthy heirs to Palmer’s accomplishment, retelling familiar stories in ways that freshly illuminate the ascent of liberal democracy."

Scholars, policymakers, and experts—including the authors of these two books—fear that the postwar Western system is breaking down in the face of a profound crisis driven not by external threats but by deep forces at work within the West itself. Luce’s well-crafted book locates the origin of the crisis in declining economic opportunities available to Western middle classes. A majority of workers in the United States and Europe are “treading water,” he writes, which has had a far-reaching, corrosive effect on social and political institutions and has created openings for populist and reactionary appeals. Rising inequality has called into question the notions of progress and social advancement that underpin the Western model of politics and economics. Meanwhile, aside from the superrich, the beneficiaries of this decaying postwar order are China and other non-Western developing states, which have prospered mightily even as they remain hostile to Western political values. Adding to the bleakness of his diagnosis, Luce appears to be ambivalent about whether anything can be done to improve things. New political coalitions and policies could help redistribute wealth and opportunity, but Luce worries that advanced democracies are unlikely to experience a recurrence of the fast-paced technological innovation and explosive growth that propelled them to prosperity in the first place."

Charging excess interest is the sin of usury, and outstanding obligations are supposed to be periodically canceled during jubilee years. The old moralists understood the dangers of insisting on the repayment of unpayable debts. But the global financial crisis has revealed that we badly need to relearn this wisdom."
52,Reform or Revolution?,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/reform-or-revolution,Reform or Revolution?,"Iran has often seemed to be on the brink of democracy. During the twentieth century, the country experienced three major political upheavals: the Constitutional Revolution of 1905–11, the oil nationalization movement of 1951–53 and the Islamic Revolution of 1978–79. Each differed from the others in important ways, but all constituted a reaction to corruption, misrule, and autocracy. They all reflected the spread of literacy, the rising expectations of a growing middle class, and the impatience of a wealthy business community with official mismanagement. They were all characterized by an aspiration for some form of democratic government. Yet each time, that aspiration was disappointed."
53,The Truth About the Minimum Wage,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2017-12-12/truth-about-minimum-wage,The Truth About the Minimum Wage,"It has been more than eight years since many of the United States’ cashiers, dishwashers, janitors, lifeguards, baggage handlers, baristas, manicurists, retail employees, housekeepers, construction laborers, home health aides, security guards, and other minimum-wage workers last got a raise. The federal minimum wage now stands at just $7.25. In real terms, these workers’ earnings have declined by nearly 13 percent since the last hike, in 2009—and have fallen by over one-third since 1968, when the real federal minimum wage was at its peak of $11.38 in today’s money (although only $1.60 then). Although most Americans think the minimum wage should go up—one 2017 poll found that 75 percent supported raising it to $9.00 per hour—today’s Republican-controlled Congress is unlikely to act."
54,Congo’s Slide Into Chaos,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/africa/2017-12-12/congos-slide-chaos,Congo’s Slide Into Chaos,"On January 16, 2001, the Democratic Republic of the Congo tumbled into uncertainty. The country’s president, Laurent Kabila, had been sitting in his office at his marble palace in Kinshasa, the capital, when one of his teenage bodyguards entered, drew his pistol, aimed it at Kabila, and fired several times."
55,Why China Won’t Rescue North Korea,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/asia/2017-12-12/why-china-wont-rescue-north-korea,Why China Won’t Rescue North Korea,"U.S. officials have long agreed with Mao Zedong’s famous formulation about relations between China and North Korea: the two countries are like “lips and teeth.” Pyongyang depends heavily on Beijing for energy, food, and most of its meager trade with the outside world, and so successive U.S. administrations have tried to enlist the Chinese in their attempts to denuclearize North Korea. U.S. President Donald Trump has bought into this logic, alternately pleading for Chinese help and threatening action if China does not do more. In the same vein, policymakers have assumed that if North Korea collapsed or became embroiled in a war with the United States, China would try to support its cherished client from afar, and potentially even deploy troops along the border to prevent a refugee crisis from spilling over into China."
56,Macron’s World,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/europe/2017-12-12/macrons-world,Macron’s World,"In 2015, before resigning his position as economy minister in President François Hollande’s government, Emmanuel Macron explained his idea of French democracy to the newspaper Le 1. “Democracy,” he said, “always implies some kind of incompleteness. . . . In French politics, this absence is the figure of the king, whose death I fundamentally believe the French people did not want.”"
57,After Credibility,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/united-states/after-credibility,After Credibility,"Believe me.” U.S. President Donald Trump has used that phrase countless times, whether he is talking about counterterrorism (“I know more about ISIS than the generals do. Believe me”), building a wall along the U.S.-Mexican border (“Believe me, one way or the other, we’re going to get that wall”), or the Iran nuclear deal (“Believe me. Oh, believe me. . . . It’s a bad deal”)."
58,Rwanda’s Recovery,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/rwanda/2017-12-12/rwandas-recovery,Rwanda’s Recovery,"When the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), the rebel movement led by Paul Kagame, captured control of Rwanda and halted the genocide in July 1994, it inherited not so much a state as a cemetery. In the preceding 100 days, 800,000 people out of a national population of seven million had been murdered, the majority by their neighbors and other civilians. Seventy percent of all Tutsis, the ethnic minority that had been the target of the Hutu génocidaires, were dead, along with 30 percent of all Twas, the smallest of Rwanda’s ethnic groups. Throughout Rwanda, roads, rivers, and pit latrines were clogged with rotting corpses. The infrastructure of the country—houses, roads, hospitals, offices, schools, power stations, and reservoirs—lay in ruins. Nearly all government workers—politicians, judges, civil servants, doctors, nurses, and teachers—had died or fled. Looters had emptied the banks, leaving the national treasury without a single Rwandan franc."
59,All Is Not Forgiven,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/south-africa/2017-12-12/all-not-forgiven,All Is Not Forgiven,"In old black-and-white photographs, the antiapartheid activist Ahmed Timol looks elegant, with an open face and a ready smile. One classic shot captures him midstride. Clad in dark sunglasses with a pipe dangling from his mouth, he has the dashing air of a 1950s film star. Shortly after that photo was taken, on October 25, 1971, Timol—a member of the South African Communist Party—was arrested. Two days later, he was dead. His body was found on the pavement outside the headquarters of the notorious Security Branch of the apartheid police in Johannesburg. An inquest overseen by an apartheid judge determined that Timol had committed suicide by jumping from a window. He was not yet 30."
60,China’s Cover-Up,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/china/chinas-cover,China’s Cover-Up,"The Chinese Communist leader Mao Zedong’s “permanent revolution” destroyed tens of millions of lives. From the communist victory in 1949 in the Chinese Civil War, through the upheaval, famine, and bloodletting of the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution, until Mao’s death in 1976, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) set segments of Chinese society against one another in successive spasms of violent class warfare. As wave after wave of savagery swept China, millions were killed and millions more sent off to “reform through labor” and ruination."
61,"Don’t Speak, Memory",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/russian-federation/2017-12-12/dont-speak-memory,"Don’t Speak, Memory","Every spring, buses covered in portraits of Joseph Stalin appear on the streets of Russian cities. His face replaces ads for cell phones, soft drinks, laundry detergent, and cat food. With each passing year, the dictator gets more handsome and more glamorous; a portrait of him in his gorgeous white generalissimo’s jacket has become especially popular. He casts his stern gaze on the citizens, as if to say, “Remember me? I’m here, I didn’t go anywhere—and don’t you forget it!”"
62,America’s Original Sin,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2017-12-12/americas-original-sin,America’s Original Sin,"The documents most closely associated with the creation of the United States—the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution—present a problem with which Americans have been contending from the country’s beginning: how to reconcile the values espoused in those texts with the United States’ original sin of slavery, the flaw that marred the country’s creation, warped its prospects, and eventually plunged it into civil war. The Declaration of Independence had a specific purpose: to cut the ties between the American colonies and Great Britain and establish a new country that would take its place among the nations of the world. But thanks to the vaulting language of its famous preamble, the document instantly came to mean more than that. Its confident statement that “all men are created equal,” with “unalienable Rights” to “Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness,” put notions of freedom and equality at the heart of the American experiment. Yet it was written by a slave owner, Thomas Jefferson, and released into 13 colonies that all, to one degree or another, allowed slavery."
63,How to Waste a Congressional Majority,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2017-11-22/how-waste-congressional-majority,How to Waste a Congressional Majority,"Governing is always hard in polarized times, but it has been especially hard during U.S. President Donald Trump’s first year in office. Undisciplined and unpopular, Trump has been largely unable to advance his agenda on Capitol Hill despite Republican control of both houses of Congress. With his political capital shrinking as his public approval falls, Trump will no doubt struggle to deliver on his campaign promises to repeal the Affordable Care Act, reform the tax code, build a wall along the southern border, and repair the nation’s crumbling infrastructure."
64,How to Stand Up to the Kremlin,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/russia-fsu/2017-12-05/how-stand-kremlin,How to Stand Up to the Kremlin,"During the Cold War, the United States and the Soviet Union faced off in an existential struggle between two antithetical systems. Either the Soviet bloc would “bury” the West, as Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev threatened in 1956, or Western principles of democratic accountability, individual rights, and the rule of law would triumph over Soviet totalitarianism. The eventual outcome—the demise of the Soviet system and the expansion of the U.S.-led international order—showed that military power is essential to American national security but also that the United States must advance its goals through the quiet resilience of democratic institutions and the attractive pull of alliances."

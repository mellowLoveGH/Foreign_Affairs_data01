Starting in the 1990s, privatization transferred public assets into private hands, and the officials guiding that process exacted a price. As the transfer process peaked, that type of corruption tailed off. Much of what now goes on in China is not “degenerative corruption,” which eats away at an economy, but “transactive corruption,” which takes place when officials and businesspeople cooperate to promote growth and consider it reasonable to share the proceeds. Despite conventional wisdom to the contrary, Wedeman contends that the Chinese Communist Party’s anticorruption campaign has been effective enough to keep the party from becoming a predatory institution. He sees the country moving into a U.S.-style “progressive era” of even more effective anticorruption measures."
1,Poverty Amid Plenty in the New India,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2012-12-27/poverty-amid-plenty-new-india,Poverty Amid Plenty in the New India,"India's economic reforms of the 1980s through the first decade of this century unleashed private enterprise, encouraged foreign investment, and expanded foreign trade. The policies generated high growth but also stirred controversy over unequal wealth distribution. Kohli's scorching critique argues that a ""state-business alliance"" dominates Indian policymaking. The political system maintains a façade of pro-poor rhetoric and politicians reach out to disadvantaged ethnic and caste groups, but policymakers remain insulated from pressures for redistribution. Kohli calls this economic strategy ""pro-business"" rather than ""pro-market"" because it coddles big firms. To be sure, the Indian version of this strategy provides less direct support to big companies than the classic East Asian versions of China, Japan, and South Korea. But the Indian government suppresses labor activism, and its antipoverty programs do not work. The exclusion of the poor from a fair share of the benefits of economic growth helps explain why they have resorted to caste-based violence and even to the Maoist, or Naxalite, rebellion that smolders in the eastern part of the country."
2,Fortress Europe: Dispatches from a Gated Continent,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2012-12-27/fortress-europe-dispatches-gated-continent,Fortress Europe: Dispatches from a Gated Continent,"Contrary to nativist alarmism, Europe is not flooded with immigrants, Muslim or otherwise. In fact, the disappearance of internal border checks within most of the European Union, domestic political pressure to restrict immigration, and heightened concerns about security during the past decade have led the countries on Europe’s edges to seal their borders more tightly. Carr argues that this combination of internal liberalization and external hardening has increased criminal, abusive, and often deadly human trafficking, while only modestly reducing immigration. The unique virtue of the book lies in Carr’s reporting from the brutal frontiers of the new Europe: Ukrainian border towns where illegal trafficking thrives, Spanish territories in Morocco where would-be immigrants are shot dead or left to die in the Sahara after attempting to scale razor-wire fences, Italian and Maltese islands where overfilled boatloads of Africans drown by the hundreds. One can understand why Carr sympathizes with these outsiders, but his advocacy is sometimes overwrought. Criticizing European leaders as fascist or racist sometimes obscures his more measured proposals for temporary work arrangements, pathways to citizenship for illegal immigrants, nuanced changes in visa requirements, respect for basic human rights, and solutions to Europe’s demographic deficit."
3,The Myth of the Muslim Tide: Do Immigrants Threaten the West?,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2012-12-27/myth-muslim-tide-do-immigrants-threaten-west,The Myth of the Muslim Tide: Do Immigrants Threaten the West?,"The topic of Muslim immigration resonates among those who indulge nostalgic nationalism, religious prejudice, or even right-wing extremism -- but also among those with an understandable fear of sudden social change. It is a subject ready-made for sensationalist journalists, resulting in a public debate poisoned by misinformation. Against that tide, Saunders has written a must-read takedown of anti-Muslim conservatives, demonstrating that their major claims are simply false. He debunks scaremongering about an emergent Muslim majority and disproves the notions that Islamic culture is impossible to assimilate and that most Muslim immigrants hold violent anti-Western views. Those slanders resemble the ones directed a century ago at Irish, Jewish, and Balkan newcomers, some of whom also had large families, required their women to be covered, and held heterodox religious beliefs that included some anti-Western ideologies. Today, Saunders concludes, the ideological clashes that matter most are taking place within Islam, and the central imperative is to create more economic and political opportunities for Muslim newcomers -- an area in which Western governments have as much responsibility as the immigrants themselves."

This book represents a corrective to the conceit the show peddles, that soldiering is simply about drills, endurance, and shooting straight."
5,The Battle of Adwa: African Victory in the Age of Empire,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2012-10-31/battle-adwa-african-victory-age-empire,The Battle of Adwa: African Victory in the Age of Empire,"In March 1896, the Ethiopian army, led by Emperor Menelik II, decisively defeated the Italian army near the town of Adwa, in northern Ethiopia, just south of today’s Eritrean border. As one of the very few military victories enjoyed by an indigenous people over an invading European army during the period of colonial expansion, Adwa served as a potent symbol for Third World nationalists. On a more practical level, the victory allowed Ethiopia to maintain its sovereignty even as the rest of the continent was carved up by the European powers. And it saved the Ethiopian monarchy, which would survive for another eight decades. Jonas tells the story well, aided by the presence of colorful characters, such as Menelik’s fiery wife, Empress Taytu, and the Italian officers whose bumbling ensured their own defeat. Jonas has little to say about Menelik’s other accomplishments as emperor, but the Adwa campaign was probably the high point of his reign, and he emerges as a crafty monarch and sharp strategist who ably manipulated the Western press in order to shape his reputation in Europe.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

Natsios provides a clear and dispassionate general introduction to the country’s history and politics, designed for the lay reader. Intimately involved in the subregion as a special envoy to Darfur during the George W. Bush administration, Natsios sheds some light on the decision-making process in the Bush White House as it grappled with the Darfur crisis and the negotiations that eventually led to an independent South Sudan. He reports that Secretary of State Colin Powell and his successor, Condoleezza Rice, both took a personal interest in Africa and were instrumental in proposing ambitious U.S. policies in the region. The book’s main achievement, though, is to succinctly explain Sudan’s history of conflict and violence, with its roots in the colonial era. Natsios argues that economic and political power in Khartoum was historically concentrated in the hands of a narrow elite drawn from three small Arab tribes from the Nile River valley of northern Sudan, who composed only about five percent of the country’s population and favored the populations of their region and Khartoum. The resulting inequalities have spurred grievances elsewhere that the central government has responded to with prevarications and violence."
7,China and Africa: A Century of Engagement,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2012-10-31/china-and-africa-century-engagement,China and Africa: A Century of Engagement,"The increased Chinese attention to Africa has been one of the region’s big stories during the last decade, not least because it seemed to come just as the West was losing interest in the continent. Major investments by China’s state-controlled companies have been accompanied by the arrival of the million or so Chinese citizens working in Africa today and by a major diplomatic initiative that has sent numerous high-level Chinese government missions to African countries in recent years. Shinn and Eisenman’s book usefully situates these developments in a broad historical context, showing important areas of continuity with earlier Sino-African links. Their analysis does not break new ground in explaining Chinese motivations or the impact of Chinese policy on Africa, but it does describe in comprehensive detail the diplomatic, commercial, and security facets of the new Chinese presence, with sections on every African country. The book is particularly strong when clarifying the evolution of Chinese diplomatic and security strategies in the region.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

In this affecting and revealing memoir, Mahama crafts an evocative portrait of Ghana’s privileged classes in the 1960s and 1970s. The son of a prominent northerner who served in the country’s first government, Mahama was introduced to Afrobeat and American rock ’n’ roll by some of his 19 siblings, to Charles Dickens by a series of elite Anglophone boarding schools, and to Marxism by the University of Ghana, in Legon. The book intersperses sentimental personal reminiscences with descriptions of the country’s ineluctable economic and political decline, from independence in 1956 through the repeated military coups of the next two decades, during which Ghana went from being one of Africa’s richest countries to being an economic basket case. Ghanaian readers might see this memoir by a current officeholder as a political instrument; others will mainly enjoy the well-crafted anecdotes and images of an Africa that no longer exists.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

Early on, Pantsov and Levine write, Mao Zedong was “an obedient pupil of the great Stalin.” But the relationship became fraught in the late 1940s, when Stalin, chronically suspicious, thought that Mao might betray him, as had Yugoslavia’s Marshal Tito -- a fear dispelled only after China entered the Korean War. Emotions affected Sino-Soviet relations later, as well, when Mao’s deep contempt for Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev exacerbated the growing rift between the two communist powers."
10,The Sunshine Policy: In Defense of Engagement as a Path to Peace in Korea,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2012-10-31/sunshine-policy-defense-engagement-path-peace-korea,The Sunshine Policy: In Defense of Engagement as a Path to Peace in Korea,"Moon, a well-known scholar, served as an adviser to Kim Dae-jung, South Korea’s president from 1998 until 2003, and to Roh Moo-hyun, who held the presidency from 2003 until 2008. The two presidents tried to thaw relations with Pyongyang, build trust, and create conditions for gradual change in the North’s political and economic systems that might lead to coexistence and eventually to peaceful unification. Moon blames U.S. President George W. Bush for disrupting those efforts before they had a chance to build on what he claims were initial successes. But to say the policy needed more time is to acknowledge that it depended on more reciprocity from the North and more strategic patience from the United States than could realistically be expected -- not to mention more support from the South Korean public, which proceeded to award the presidency to a hard-liner, Lee Myung-bak, in 2008. Nevertheless, Moon explains the logic of the “sunshine policy” well and calls for its revival, making a strong case that every other option -- military pressure, containment, and waiting for the regime in Pyongyang to collapse -- has failed.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

For many years, a vast network of postmasters, running postal operations and even some welfare services out of their own premises, helped build local support bases for the ruling Liberal Democratic Party. They offered state-sponsored savings accounts and life insurance policies, the investments from which the government then channeled into politically popular infrastructure projects. Critics derided the system as a symptom of Japanese bureaucratic immobilism, but would-be reformers were stymied until 2005, when the maverick LDP prime minister Junichiro Koizumi pushed through legislation that mandated the breakup of the postal system and forced it into private hands. Koizumi succeeded in part because of weakening ties between the postal old guard and elected politicians. Postmasters are now employed by private firms, but they remain a potent interest group, fighting to uphold the traditional values of small-scale community service. And they are no longer committed to the LDP, thus contributing to the new fluidity of Japanese party politics. Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

In February 1914, international pressure forced the Ottomans to acquiesce to eventual self-rule for the Armenians in Anatolia’s eastern provinces. The Ottomans entered World War I in order to annul this agreement, but they feared that it would come back in some other form. According to Akçam, a Turkish historian, their preemptive “solution” was to shrink the Armenian population from around 1.3 million to around 200,000 within a few years, through deportation, starvation, and other means, including the outright murder of probably around 300,000 Armenians. Akçam claims that the Special Organization of the Committee of Union and Progress (CUP), the secular nationalist party of the Young Turks, handled the genocide and was abetted by Mehmet Talat Pasha, the minister of the interior. All instructions were coded, delivered by CUP emissaries, and destroyed after being read. Plausible deniability was built into the system; the CUP knew it had tracks to cover. For a layman, the argument is convincing but not airtight. It is possible to see how the evidence presented could also be spun to fit a scenario of unplanned mass carnage. But the fact that a Turkish historian with access to the Ottoman archives has written this book is of immeasurable significance.

15,Islam and the Arab Awakening,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2012-10-31/islam-and-arab-awakening,Islam and the Arab Awakening,"Ramadan, a professor of Islamic studies at the University of Oxford, is more famous for being the grandson of Hasan al-Banna, the founder of the Muslim Brotherhood. In this book, he uses the Arab uprisings of 2011 as a pretext to revisit themes raised in his earlier writings. He hopes that contemporary Islamism can recapture values that were laid to waste by two centuries of colonialism and argues that Islamist governance can be compatible with the rule of law, equality for all citizens, universal suffrage, accountability, and the separation of powers. Secularist reformers, he fears, are less interested in those goals than in integrating the Arab world into a neo-liberal world order that he rejects. His analysis of the uprisings waffles between admiration for the protesters and a suspicion that the United States had a hand in training them. Ramadan sees almost every event in recent Middle Eastern history as serving a neoliberal order that favors regional stability, corporate interests, and Israel’s survival -- and as the result of a neoliberal plot, a common view in the Arab world.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

Bush years. Gerges prefers the regionalists but recognizes that President Barack Obama has not changed the balance between the two. He sees Obama’s Cairo speech of 2009 as an embarrassment because the hopes it raised have gone unfulfilled. Bending to a desire for continuity in U.S. policy on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Obama divorced the American response to the Arab uprisings of 2011 from that conflict, despite the organic link between the two. One key premise of the book is questionable. Gerges asserts that “America’s ability to act unilaterally and hegemonically has come to an end.” But the United States has never had that ability, except perhaps for a very brief moment at the end of the Cold War. In reality, U.S. policy in the Middle East has been a string of frustrations interrupted by occasional successes, such as the Camp David accords and Operation Desert Storm.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

The book strings together a series of vignettes bereft of a master narrative, hopping between naval encounters in the Persian Gulf and policy developments in Washington. As a result, the whole is less than the sum of its parts. Crist nicely captures the surreal nature of the policy world in Washington by noting the out-comes that the George W. Bush administration considered acceptable in Iran: either regime change or an Iranian decision to end the country’s nuclear program, cut its ties with Hezbollah, become a democracy, and acquiesce to U.S. goals in the Middle East. The book traces the mostly Iranian initiatives for a “grand bargain” with the West and the Bush administration’s decision to eschew that course in favor of destabilization and regime change. U.S. President Barack Obama’s search for dialogue has not allayed the fears of Iran’s hard-liners that Bush’s objectives still prevail in Washington.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

But he broke with the government of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, which then forced him out and accused him of espionage. He left Iran and took a position as a research scholar at Princeton University. Mousavian has produced an analysis of the situation free of hyperbole or bombast that contrasts the bargaining strategies of Iran’s pragmatists, of whom Mousavian is a proponent, and its hard-liner “principlists,” represented by Ahmadinejad. Despite his political persecution, Mousavian is a staunch defender of Iran’s basic goal of mastering the nuclear fuel cycle, and his book leaves the reader with the strong impression that the West is not dealing with a set of messianic lunatics in Tehran. He laments that the United States and other Western powers have made demands of Iran that go beyond the requirements of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. While conceding some Iranian deceptions, he argues that they were justified because Iran was denied the technical support guaranteed by the treaty. Like other observers, he suspects that what the United States really seeks in Iran is regime change, not an agreement on the nuclear issue.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

That same year, Soviet Premier Leonid Brezhnev signed a decree vastly expanding the country’s efforts to develop and weaponize bacterial and viral pathogens. Before it ostensibly ended a year after the fall of the Soviet Union, the program constituted the longest and largest of its kind, involving as many as 65,000 scientists, engineers, technicians, and support staff, spread across a maze of civilian research centers, ministries, and agencies. Its products included more than a dozen vaccine-resistant strains, including one that would induce “an illness similar to multiple sclerosis, but with quick results.” All of this was clearly in violation of the 1972 treaty and thus regularly denied by Soviet officials until the very end. Leitenberg and Zilinskas lay out the details in this massive volume, which explores every dimension of the program: its technical aspects, what U.S. and British intelligence knew about it, the role of Warsaw Pact allies, the proliferation risk, and how it compared to the Soviet chemical weapons program. Still, they stress how much cannot be known, including all that remains behind the Russian Ministry of Defense’s sealed doors and lips.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

They also embody the rules and practices that determine who falls under a state’s jurisdiction, with what rights and obligations, and who gets to come and go -- and on what terms. In this careful, economical history, Lohr demonstrates that Russia is not the eternally immured nation it has seemed for much of its history, with the Soviet Union only its most extreme version. Even before Peter the Great, but especially after the Great Reforms of the 1860s, Russia’s efforts to modernize led to a patchwork approach to immigration, emigration, and naturalization. Lohr effortlessly guides readers through the complex evolution of the rules for determining who was a Russian citizen as the expanding empire engulfed foreign peoples. In this story, the Soviet Union is the outlier, both because of the thick walls the Communists erected and because they based citizenship policy on class, rather than on ethnicity or place of birth. Over the centuries, however, Russia’s Jews were the policy’s most consistent victims.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

For those who assume that the country, safely sheltered in the European Union and NATO, is well on the way to democratic stability and western European–style liberalism, this book will come as a bit of a shock. Prime Minister Viktor Orbán’s 2010 electoral victory, Lendvai writes, “has put an end to the liberal democracy existing in Hungary since 1990 and has smoothed the path to a populist autocracy.” In Lendvai’s eyes, the willful, power-hungry Orbán has evolved from a dynamic leader into a calculating nationalist bent on closing off democratic options and ready to exploit anti-Semitism and anti-Roma sentiment. Although Lendvai’s indictment is sharpest against Hungary’s current leader, he makes plain that the corruption and economic recklessness of earlier governments did their part to bring about the country’s degradation. Not surprisingly, Lendvai’s assessment has kicked up more than a little dust in Hungary.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

No other military leader played so central a role in so many battles that determined the war’s outcome, from the defense of Leningrad and Stalingrad to the conquest of Germany. Zhukov made misjudgments in some campaigns, but as Roberts details, he had few, if any, peers when it came to his instincts during complex strategic situations, his capacity to size up and mold the forces under his command, and his mastery of large-scale military actions, such as Operation Bagration, in 1944, in which 2.4 million Soviet troops, 5,200 tanks, and 36,000 artillery pieces sent the Germans reeling back across Europe. Even more remarkable was Zhukov’s ability to survive in the Soviet system, a tale well told in this compact biography. Stalin spared him from a purge of senior officers in the 1930s only to cast him out after the war, fearing that Zhukov had become too glorified. Zhukov returned as minister of defense under Nikita Khrushchev, only to fall from grace once more, in 1958. Yet today, sanctified once again by Russia’s new leaders, his imposing statue now stands near the entrance to Red Square.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

In those years, the country experienced an unbinding of conscience, a gimlet-eyed confrontation with the lies told and lived, a quest to define a fairer and more virtuous relationship between the individual and the state -- ferment swept across all of political, cultural, and intellectual life. Drawing material from a rich archive of newspapers, novels, memoirs, and magazines, Aron skillfully captures the vastness and intensity of this transfiguration of ideas, which he argues played a larger role in the Soviet system’s undoing than the material and structural factors that others see as the primary explanations. But Aron’s account is less convincing when it comes to explaining why the soul-searching of those heady days later mutated into something more diffuse and less compelling.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

She begins with a good summary of the scholarship on the causes of the war, which the opposition leader Guillermo Ungo succinctly described as a combination of social inequality and authoritarian politics. In the 1960s and 1970s, demands from the peaceful opposition were met by government repression; the result was revolution. Skipping over the war itself, the book focuses on the dynamics of the peace process. Negroponte argues convincingly that success resulted from a confluence of circumstances: with the end of the Cold War, the United States and the Soviet Union lost interest in fueling a proxy fight; the Salvadoran government and the guerrillas had fought to a “hurting stalemate,” in which neither had any prospect of military victory; and the negotiations were aided by skillful external mediators, especially the UN diplomat Álvaro de Soto. Negroponte notes that the United States went from unabashedly advocating military victory for the Salvadoran armed forces during the Reagan years to earnestly seeking a negotiated peace under President George H. W. Bush. Even then, Washington was by no means a neutral mediator and constantly pressured de Soto on the Salvadoran government’s behalf.

Some contributions are pedantic, and there is no balanced assessment of the region’s economic progress, but the volume’s overall high quality makes for a stimulating, if sometimes dense, read. Humberto Félix Berumen provides lucid “snapshots” of the diverse interpretations of Tijuana: as a paradise of illicit pleasures, as a border melting pot, and as a symbol of cultural postmodernism. Well-crafted essays by Teddy Cruz and Tito Alegría take the reader for a drive through the heterogeneous neighborhoods of San Diego and Tijuana, arguing that despite the tens of millions of border crossings per year, the contiguous cities are far apart socially and economically. Lucía Sanromán, Jennifer Insley-Pruitt, and Ejival expertly interpret, respectively, Tijuana’s vibrant arts, literary, and music scenes. Luis Humberto Crosthwaite’s poetic essay captures the frustrations and paranoia produced among Mexicans by the behavior of U.S. Department of Homeland Security guards at border crossings."

As Blofield incisively chronicles, until recently, household servants and nannies, who compose 15 percent of the economically active female population in Latin America, were systematically denied basic labor protections. But in country after country, their advocates have improved their lot by making good use of democratic processes. Local conditions have defined the debates: in Bolivia, the campaign on behalf of domestic workers was framed as a continuation of the struggle for the rights of indigenous people, while in Costa Rica, advocates successfully appealed to the nation’s pride in its outstanding human rights record. Nevertheless, executive enforcement of new legislation often lags, ministries of labor lack adequate resources, and discriminatory laws remain in place in many countries. Significantly, in 2011, the International Labor Organization called on all its member states to honor the rights of domestic workers, bolstering the activists’ cause and pressuring governments to do better on this crucial issue.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

U.S. consumers have grown accustomed to good-value wines from Chile, beautiful flowers from Colombia, nutritious avocados from Mexico, and well-engineered Embraer jets from Brazil. These case studies trace the birth and growth of the dynamic industries that produce these goods, placing special emphasis on the helping hands of governments and on the self-interested cooperation among local firms. As the strong overview by Sabel underscores, governments can assist in basic research and patent protection, offer tax incentives and targeted credits, ensure quality and safety standards, and promote the “country brand.” Rather than destroy one another through competition, local firms can band together to lobby national and foreign governments for favorable treatment. Oddly, the volume understates the vital role often played by international investors in transferring new technologies and offering access to global markets: the Spanish firm Torres was instrumental in modernizing Chilean wineries, a U.S. scientist revolutionized the Colombian flower industry, and Israeli technicians assisted Mexican avocado growers.

A new middle class, born of the oil-based prosperity of the last decade, took to the streets to voice its opposition to the perceived corruption of the political elite, especially United Russia, the ruling party of then Prime Minister Vladimir Putin. For a time, as the protest movement gained momentum, the very foundations of the regime appeared to shake.

Yet in many of the world’s most competitive economies, notably Denmark, Germany, and other northern European countries, most businesses reject the pure free-market ideal and band together to support government interventions of this kind in order to promote national competitiveness. In this detailed analysis, Martin and Swank trace this cooperative attitude to the existence of centralized business associations able to discipline their members in support of common projects. Such associations emerged nearly a century ago and have survived not because business leaders in northern Europe are intrinsically socialist but because in multiparty parliamentary systems, businesspeople struck a mutually beneficial bargain with politicians. They accepted the institutional constraints of robust government regulation in exchange for a seat at the policymaking table. There is a fundamental lesson here: the preferences of private companies are determined by social choices, not by the disembodied logic of markets. With a sound constitutional structure and proper leadership, a government can help shape how markets work, along with businesses and citizens -- to the benefit of all.

Chirac started his in 1950 on the streets of Paris, handing out copies of the communist daily L’Humanité, and ended it in 2007 as a Gaullist president of the French Republic. True to his reputation, he comes across as likable, unpretentious, and intelligent. He describes with equal charm and ease his first sexual experience, the intricacies of European agricultural policies, and the pettiness of former French President Valéry Giscard d’Estaing. But Chirac’s story often seems like not much more than a series of excuses for why he achieved so little. During his first term as prime minister, in the 1970s, he was hamstrung by Giscard. In the 1980s, the Socialists cynically introduced proportional representation to strengthen the extreme right and undermine Chirac’s Gaullist party. Chirac then “cohabited” as prime minister with a Socialist president, François Mitterrand. In the 1990s, he achieved the presidency himself only to rule over a motley coalition of conservatives and blunt the ambition of his rising successor, Nicolas Sarkozy. As with most political memoirists, Chirac portrays his motives throughout his struggles as uniformly noble and pure.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

Italy’s good qualities include its art, beauty, warmth, family values, individual creativity, and sparkling postwar economic record. Bad Italy is a land of bureaucracy, legalism, hierarchy, corruption, violence, and present-day economic doldrums, all abetted by irresponsible and self-dealing politicians. This book is not the most nuanced, well-informed, or original such analysis to appear in recent years. Still, Emmott -- a former editor of The Economist who raised eyebrows a decade ago by questioning former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi’s fitness for leadership on the magazine’s cover -- writes clearly and succinctly. His bottom line: the current crisis could purge Italy of its evil dealings and spur labor, budgetary, and regulatory reforms. This is precisely the agenda the current prime minister, Mario Monti, is pursuing today. Yet the absence of a fine-grained analysis of Italian politics, society, and culture leaves the reader with little insight into exactly how this plan can succeed. In the end, as the book’s subtitle suggests, the reader is left with little more than a religious metaphor to point the way forward for this lovely but exasperating nation."

It is a subject ready-made for sensationalist journalists, resulting in a public debate poisoned by misinformation. Against that tide, Saunders has written a must-read takedown of anti-Muslim conservatives, demonstrating that their major claims are simply false. He debunks scaremongering about an emergent Muslim majority and disproves the notions that Islamic culture is impossible to assimilate and that most Muslim immigrants hold violent anti-Western views. Those slanders resemble the ones directed a century ago at Irish, Jewish, and Balkan newcomers, some of whom also had large families, required their women to be covered, and held heterodox religious beliefs that included some anti-Western ideologies. Today, Saunders concludes, the ideological clashes that matter most are taking place within Islam, and the central imperative is to create more economic and political opportunities for Muslim newcomers -- an area in which Western governments have as much responsibility as the immigrants themselves."

Sanger finds much to admire in President Barack Obama’s ideals and some of the decisions Obama has made, but he paints an unsettling picture of a White House perplexed by Afghanistan, confused by the dilemma of humanitarian intervention, and thrown off balance by the Arab Spring. Yet Sanger’s most telling criticism is that Obama has not used the bully pulpit to explain his foreign policy and its goals to the nation and the world. The United States may not be winning many wars these days, but it is clearly producing some very good journalists, as well as a host of senior officials who seem to think that long, frank conversations with reporters do not in any way conflict with their duty to the nation. One wonders how today’s journalists would have reported on the Lincoln and Roosevelt administrations at war and whether those presidents would have appreciated aides who chose an energetic reporter as a confidant.

Religion has influenced U.S. foreign policy in many ways: the personal convictions of U.S. presidents and other leaders, the political power of religious organizations, and the public voices of religious thinkers and leaders, such as Reinhold Niebuhr and Billy Graham, have all had an impact on U.S. policy choices. Preston links the theological convictions of men such as Abraham Lincoln, William McKinley, the two Roosevelts, Harry Truman, and Dwight Eisenhower to the policy choices they made. His analysis demonstrates that religious influence has hardly been limited to the political right: liberal and even radical approaches to foreign policy have also reflected religious ideas and lobbying. As in any work of this scope, it is impossible for Preston to get everything right or address every issue.

That is the ambitious and important task Zunz set for himself in this substantive book. Zunz is at his strongest when examining philanthropy as an instrument with which the Progressive movement of the early twentieth century reshaped the nation in an effort to provide support for the movement’s best causes (public health, mass mobilization, political reform) as well as its worst (eugenics and segregation). Zunz also shows how World War I led to national efforts to harness and rationalize the giving impulse and imbue philanthropy as a whole with a patriotic character. Philanthropy in America is particularly insightful regarding the legal basis of philanthropy, exploring how court battles and legal reforms have either encouraged or checked the growth of giving to causes for more than a hundred years. As the story approaches the present day, it becomes quite complex, and Zunz sometimes loses the thread of the narrative. Nevertheless, this is an excellent resource for those interested in philanthropy and its place in American life."

After the founder of Mormonism, Joseph Smith, was lynched by a mob in Missouri, Young rallied the stricken Mormons and organized their mass migration to Utah, where he defeated or defied Native American tribes, internal rivals, and a series of U.S. presidents as he built and defended his empire. For more than 20 years, Young labored to forge the unruly population of Utah into a united people; when he died, in 1877, he did so with the knowledge that the mark he had made on the American West would endure.

The occasion was touched with melancholy, as the visibly ailing Roosevelt attempted to show that he could still be the master of events and Churchill struggled to preserve the British Empire even though he knew its moment was passing. The book ends with Hiroshima. By that point, the Soviets’ behavior in the territories they had taken over from the Nazis had already alerted the Americans and the British to the likely emptiness of Stalin’s promises at Yalta. Of course, the United States would have used the atom bomb against Japan even had there not been a growing rift between the East and the West, but the rift added to the bomb’s significance. There are no startling revelations in this book, but Dobbs is a gifted writer.

(The second volume will consider the war’s politics and diplomacy.) Veith’s intensive research and interviews, which make use of Vietnamese as well as American sources, yield a level of detail that is a bit overwhelming and likely to deter all but the most enthusiastic readers. The book is nonetheless a service to military history, for no one has produced nearly as thorough an account of these events. Veith argues that the South Vietnamese army was unfairly blamed for its own defeat and demonstrates that its incompetence was overstated. Although he accepts that senior South Vietnamese commanders made mistakes, he believes that the real reasons for the South’s defeat were North Vietnam’s failure to abide by the Paris peace accords and the United States’ failure to provide the South Vietnamese with the material support they deserved.

Enforcing Trade Rules in the WTO,"The creation during the past two decades of a formal mechanism for settling trade disputes at the World Trade Organization represents a positive, if quiet, development in the global economy. Davis examines the circumstances that lead countries to choose the expensive and time-consuming effort of taking a dispute to the WTO, as opposed to resolving matters through bilateral negotiations. She analyzes complaints made by 81 countries, focusing in detail on the United States, which has registered the largest number of complaints (followed by the European Union, Canada, and Brazil), and on Japan, the world’s second-largest national economy during the period Davis studied. Two cases get particular attention: the dispute over whether Boeing and Airbus have received unfair or illegal subsidies from the U.S. and European governments and Japan’s numerous complaints about U.S. antidumping tariffs, especially on steel products. Davis finds that in democracies, public and legislative pressures play an important role in the decision to file a complaint and that taking a case to the WTO tends to defuse domestic political pressures by signaling that the government takes the dispute seriously.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

Food aid flows bilaterally from donors to recipients but also increasingly goes through the UN World Food Program and through nongovernmental organizations such as churches. The main issues of contention are whether food aid should be used to advance economic development goals, as envisioned by U.S. policies; whether aid levels should depend on supplies from donor countries, which raises the cost and sometimes causes delays in delivery; whether donated food should be sold or given away; the extent to which food aid should include genetically modified products; and how aid should be coordinated from a growing list of donors, which now includes China, India, and South Korea.

He foresees a fifth industrial revolution, following the earlier ones, which were based, respectively, on steam power and textiles, railroads and steamships, electricity and chemicals, and computers. The main characteristics of the next revolution -- which Marsh believes has already begun and will unfold over the next three decades or so -- will be a greater dispersion of manufacturing around the world, with numerous cross-border connections, smaller-scale production lines, more customization of products to suit the tastes of particular consumers, more niche firms, and a greater emphasis on providing consulting and follow-on services to customers along with products. Marsh illustrates his more general points with interesting details about particular firms: a leading German pencil firm, for instance, gets its graphite from Sri Lanka, its high-quality wood from Oregon, and its special clay from Germany, and it produces pencils in 14 plants around the world, including in Brazil, China, India, and Indonesia.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

Tomasi casts a skeptical eye on the supposed followers of classical liberal economists, such as Friedrich Hayek, and those of justice-oriented philosophers, such as John Rawls, arguing cogently that a proper reading of the two schools of thought reveals no deep philosophical mismatch. But it seems that their respective acolytes may be so ideologically committed that they don’t really care what the masters actually wrote. Tomasi suggests something of a compromise between the two approaches, which he dubs “free market fairness” or “market democracy”: recognizing that self-respect and dignity flow from making choices among opportunities, rather than from being told what to do by government officials, but also requiring governments to ensure that opportunities are, in fact, available.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

In his latest book, the journalist makes his most thoughtful statement yet about how power in world politics is shaped by these forces. Although the book does not delve deeply into intellectual history, Kaplan dusts off the ideas of such classical realists as Halford Mackinder, Hans Morgenthau, and Nicholas Spykman on geography -- heartlands and “rimlands,” oceans and sea power. In his explorations of the geopolitics of China, India, Russia, and the West, Kaplan demonstrates that the world is certainly not “flat” and that the first step in understanding great-power politics in the twenty-first century is still to look at a map. Geography has given the United States many strategic options. But Kaplan argues that short of a dramatic lurch toward isolationism, the United States is destined to remain the great balancing power in Eurasia.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

In this lucid and thoughtful book, Litwak compares the performances of the George W. Bush and Obama administrations in handling such foes. In the aftermath the 9/11 attacks, Bush argued that “rogue” conduct derived from the character of the regime itself and used that notion to justify a shift from a policy of containing Iraq to one of regime change. Litwak argues that the Bush administration sent mixed signals on Iran and North Korea, never fully making clear whether the U.S. objective was regime change or behavior change. The Obama administration has tried to recast the debate by framing “outlier” status in terms of conduct that violates established international norms, offering Iran and North Korea a pathway into the community of nations. But this engagement strategy has also faltered. In the end, Litwak suggests that combining a strategy of containment with offers of negotiations is the best way to cope with states that threaten the international order.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."
57,Advancing the Rule of Law Abroad: Next Generation Reform,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2012-10-31/advancing-rule-law-abroad-next-generation-reform,Advancing the Rule of Law Abroad: Next Generation Reform,"Many of the United States’ most important foreign policy goals -- promoting markets, spreading democracy, fighting terrorism -- hinge on strengthening the rule of law in other countries. Yet after decades of ambitious efforts by the United States and others, the rule of law is still absent in many parts of the world. Kleinfeld argues that the “first generation” efforts of governments and the aid community focused too narrowly on the reform of courts and legal institutions, which often had little impact on corruption, crime, and abuses of state power. She calls for a “second generation” agenda that would seek to influence the cultural norms and expectations of public servants and citizens, encouraging bottom-up change within civil society by focusing on power and culture instead of laws and institutions. Kleinfeld brings together a good grasp of the scholarship on law and society with the sensibilities and hard-earned experience of a field practitioner. The result is essential reading for the foreign policy community.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."
58,Governing the World: The History of an Idea,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2012-10-31/governing-world-history-idea,Governing the World: The History of an Idea,"In the aftermaths of the Napoleonic Wars and the two world wars, the Western great powers made repeated efforts to build a world order that would establish peace and protect their interests, organized around various types of international bodies. Mazower is interested in why they did this and why, in particular, the United Kingdom and the United States invested so much “time and political capital” in building international institutions. If the book has a general thesis, it is that the global institutions created in the name of liberal institutionalism have really been tools used by great powers to expand their influence, protect their sovereignty, and keep other countries in check. The most interesting chapter focuses on the way mid-nineteenth-century scientific visions of the world as a system, along with the new professions of statistics, engineering, and geography, spurred the creation of new forms of international organization and cooperation. Mazower is clearly fluent in the history he relates, but he fails to engage the vast literature of international relations scholarship that explores this topic, missing an opportunity to develop a more formidable and novel argument.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

60,The Quality of Command,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/quality-command,The Quality of Command,"The argument of Thomas Ricks’ new book, The Generals, is simple: since the end of World War II, the combat performance of the U.S. Army has been subpar, primarily because the highest-ranking generals have been reluctant to fire underperforming generals lower in the chain of command. The fear of being relieved of duty in wartime, Ricks contends, drives military leaders to act boldly, flexibly, and creatively. When that fear is present -- as Ricks claims it was during World War II, thanks to U.S. General George Marshall’s whip hand -- good generals get better, and bad generals get purged. But when that fear is absent -- as Ricks believes it has been over the past several decades -- mediocrity prevails, with unfortunate consequences for the army and the nation."
61,The Future of Special Operations,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/united-states/future-special-operations,The Future of Special Operations,"Over the past decade, the United States' military and the country's national security strategy have come to rely on special operations to an unprecedented degree. As identifying and neutralizing terrorists and insurgents has become one of the Pentagon's most crucial tasks, special operations forces have honed their ability to conduct manhunts, adopting a new targeting system known as ""find, fix, finish, exploit, analyze, and disseminate."" They have adopted a flatter organizational structure and collaborated more closely with intelligence agencies, allowing special operations to move at ""the speed of war,"" in the words of the retired army general Stanley McChrystal, the chief architect of the contemporary U.S. approach to counterterrorism."

63,Broken BRICs,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/brazil/2012-10-22/broken-brics,Broken BRICs,"Over the past several years, the most talked-about trend in the global economy has been the so-called rise of the rest, which saw the economies of many developing countries swiftly converging with those of their more developed peers. The primary engines behind this phenomenon were the four major emerging-market countries, known as the BRICs: Brazil, Russia, India, and China. The world was witnessing a once-in-a-lifetime shift, the argument went, in which the major players in the developing world were catching up to or even surpassing their counterparts in the developed world. These forecasts typically took the developing world's high growth rates from the middle of the last decade and extended them straight into the future, juxtaposing them against predicted sluggish growth in the United States and other advanced industrial countries. Such exercises supposedly proved that, for example, China was on the verge of overtaking the United States as the world's largest economy-a point that Americans clearly took to heart, as over 50 percent of them, according to a Gallup poll conducted this year, said they think that China is already the world's ""leading"" economy, even though the U.S. economy is still more than twice as large (and with a per capita income seven times as high)."

65,God’s Politics,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/review-essay/2012-11-01/gods-politics,God’s Politics,"With its commandments and parables, its kings and its prophets, the Hebrew Bible has served as a reference point for Western politics for centuries. Almost every kind of political movement, it seems, has drawn its own message from the text. For the contemporary left, it inspires calls for social justice and the redistribution of wealth. The right, meanwhile, uses it to preach adherence to traditional social values and family structures. But what does the Hebrew Bible actually have to say about politics? Is there a consistent set of political principles to be found in it? In God’s Shadow, a recent book by the philosopher Michael Walzer, attempts to tackle these questions. As Walzer observes, there’s a good reason why so many opposing movements claim the Hebrew Bible as their own: the book’s stories, messages, and political arrangements are simply too diverse to fit under any unified theory of government. In fact, they give credence to many."
66,The Problem With the Pivot,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/asia/2012-11-01/problem-pivot,The Problem With the Pivot,"Ever since the Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping opened up his country’s economy in the late 1970s, China has managed to grow in power, wealth, and military might while still maintaining cooperative and friendly relations with most of the world. Until a few years ago, that is, when Beijing seemed to change tack, behaving in a way that alienated its neighbors and aroused suspicion abroad. In December 2009, for example, Beijing’s resistance to compromise at the UN Climate Change Conference angered European countries and the United States. Then, following the January 2010 sale of U.S. arms to Taiwan, the Chinese government suspended a senior U.S.-Chinese security dialogue for the first time and announced unprecedented sanctions against U.S. companies with ties to Taiwan (although it is not clear that the sanctions caused meaningful damage). In July of that year, Beijing angrily protested plans for U.S.–South Korean naval exercises in the Yellow Sea, and in September, it excoriated Japan for detaining the captain of a Chinese fishing boat that had rammed a Japanese coast guard ship in disputed waters. To cap off this series of unsettling episodes, Beijing voiced excessive hostility toward democratic countries and imposed economic sanctions on Norway after the Nobel Prize committee awarded the Chinese democracy activist Liu Xiaobo the Peace Prize in October. In a few short months, China had managed to undo much of what it had gained through years of talk about its “peaceful rise.”"

68,Peace Out,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/2012-10-12/peace-out,Peace Out,"Every aspiring beauty-pageant queen knows what to say when asked what she wants most: ""World peace."" World peace is at least nominally what we all want most. But evidently, we are not very good at making it. The modern peace movement is almost 200 years old; its origins can be traced to the period that followed the devastating wars of the Napoleonic era in Europe. In those two centuries, peace movements have had little discernible impact on world events, and what effect they have had has often been bad: the European peace and disarmament movement of the 1930s, for example, greatly facilitated Hitler's plans for a war of revenge. For all the good they have done, those well-intentioned souls who have sought to achieve world peace through the organization of committees, the signing of petitions, the holding of rallies, and the promotion of international treaties might just as well have stayed home."

It draws on the same insights that led to the earlier digitizations of communication and computation, but now what is being programmed is the physical world rather than the virtual one. Digital fabrication will allow individuals to design and produce tangible objects on demand, wherever and whenever they need them. Widespread access to these technologies will challenge traditional models of business, aid, and education."

The riots showcased both the power of radical Islamist militias and the inability of the government in Tripoli to provide security and maintain order across the country. Lawlessness and corruption are pervasive, and fundamental questions about the structure and operation of Libyan political and economic institutions remain unanswered. None of this, however, should obscure the fact that the larger story about the new Libya is surprisingly positive. The worst-case scenarios commonly predicted a year ago have not emerged, and there are actually grounds for guarded optimism about the future."

Most of his pupils had been affected in some way by the Mau Mau rebellion against the British colonizers in the 1950s. Following Kenya’s independence in 1963, many became part of the country’s first relatively well-educated indigenous elite and rose to prominence in government and business. Sandgren returned to Kenya in 1995 and interviewed 75 of the 90 or so students he had taught three decades earlier. This book is the fascinating result. Interesting details abound, including the fact that many of his students started their careers in the public sector but later left for the much higher wages available in business. Although Kenya was mired in a recession in the mid-1990s and some of his former students were nervous about the country’s future, they had generally ensured solid educational opportunities for their children, many of whom took university educations for granted.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

Unlike similar books, Young’s considers the areas north and south of the Sahara, focusing on the political and diplomatic links between the two, as well as their common history. The book is at its strongest when addressing the relationship between ethnic identity, nationalism, and the state, a subject on which Young has produced seminal analyses for several decades. With remarkable command of the evidence and a keen grasp of theoretical nuance, Young shows how colonialism and the patterns of modernization it wrought dramatically altered cultural identities and created cleavages between groups, which still shape domestic conflict throughout the region, sometimes with devastating consequences.

Both of these books shed light on this question by emphasizing political processes rather than ideology or economic policy.
3,Poor Numbers: How We Are Misled by African Development Statistics and What to Do About It,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2013-04-21/poor-numbers-how-we-are-misled-african-development-statistics-and,Poor Numbers: How We Are Misled by African Development Statistics and What to Do About It,"Jerven demonstrates with devastating clarity that African governments produce imprecise economic statistics that should not be trusted. Based on his firsthand observations of a number of bureaucracies that issue economic statistics, Jerven paints a disturbing portrait of how sub-Saharan African governments devise their national accounts. Entire subsectors of some economies are not recorded, and others are assumed not to have changed in several decades. Data often reflect assumptions about production and consumption patterns that are questionable or even demonstrably false. As a result, Jerven claims, national statistics about economic production might be off by as much as 50 percent, probably in the direction of underestimating economic activity. In 2010, when Ghana corrected the methods it used to calculate its GDP, the figure grew by 70 percent. Jerven concludes with a number of useful suggestions for how to remedy the situation, such as encouraging national statistical offices, which tend to rely on occasional efforts to collect lots of information, to instead take more frequent, smaller surveys. But readers who use African statistics will still be left deeply unsettled.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."
4,Two Books on Terror in Mao's China and Stalin's Russia,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2013-04-22/two-books-terror-maos-china-and-stalins-russia,Two Books on Terror in Mao’s China and Stalin’s Russia,"If anyone needs a reminder of the inscrutability and mercilessness of the Stalin and Mao regimes, these books can help. Hu Feng was a distinguished Marxist literary critic whom Mao made a prime target of a major campaign to intimidate independent thinkers in the early years of the Chinese communist regime. Hu spent 24 years in various forms of imprisonment. For much of the time, he was accompanied by his wife, Mei Zhi—an unusual privilege probably attributable to Hu’s age and fragile health. In her memoir, she recounts their experiences. Hu was constantly pressured to “reform his worldview” to match the new political campaigns Mao launched. As the couple’s situation became more and more hopeless, Hu stopped insisting on his innocence and lost his sanity. He outlived Mao but passed away a few years after his release from prison, at the age of 82."

But this book shows that the same is true throughout Asia—except in the poorest countries, where life expectancies are low. According to the book’s authors, by 2050, the portion of Asians over age 65 will range from 14 percent, in India, to 38 percent, in Japan. In the United States, the figure will be about 20 percent. Even more remarkable is the speed of the transition: in many countries, the over-65 share of the population will double or even triple over the course of four decades. To deal with the implications of this change for economic growth and social dependency, the authors recommend that governments establish or strengthen pension and retirement saving systems. They suggest that some governments should stop trying to limit population growth and instead encourage more births. Retirement ages should be raised. Countries with relatively young populations, such as India and the Philippines, should take advantage of the productivity of younger cohorts by increasing educational opportunities and labor-market flexibility. Finally, they argue, loosened restrictions on labor migration would benefit everyone.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

Throughout this century of contact, the Americans assured the Tibetans of their friendship and support but never abandoned the position that Tibet is part of China. In the 1950s and early 1960s, the United States provided limited training and assistance to Tibetan guerillas resisting Chinese rule, a program in which Knaus participated as a CI officer. But this aid was sufficient only to harass, not expel, Chinese forces. What ultimately drives U.S. policy on Tibet seems to be a fascination with Tibetan culture and religion rather than any strategic calculus. Although Knaus celebrates U.S. support for Tibet, his narrative shows how inconsistent attention, confused thinking, and intermittent diplomatic freelancing on Washington’s part have produced a murky policy that has served the Tibetan cause poorly.

The army responded by bombing and shelling tent encampments and makeshift schools and hospitals while denying the refugees access to food, water, and medical supplies. Terrorized families were smashed by artillery if they stayed in this cage and shot by one side or the other if they tried to escape. The general outlines of this story are familiar. But Weiss, a UN official in Colombo at the time, provides harrowing details, as well as insight into the decades of brutal conflict that brought the two sides to the point where they were willing to commit war crimes. The perpetrators on one side are dead. Those on the other continue to govern Sri Lanka and to resist all attempts to demand accountability.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

Elliott’s interviews and his close reading of texts show that the country’s revolutionary true believers went through a contentious process to justify a more pragmatic approach. They ultimately came to terms with Vietnam’s need, as a small country, to cooperate with its neighbors, and so Vietnam joined the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. The leaders decided that U.S. power was sufficiently balanced by other big powers to prevent Washington from dominating the region, and they began to cooperate with the United States. They decided that they could defend socialism and still join the World Trade Organization, so long as they were able to raise domestic living standards. These compromises were paradoxical: the leaders could protect Vietnam’s autonomy only by opening up the country’s economy. As a result, Vietnam is deeply interdependent with the rest of the world but still authoritarian and suspicious of foreign actors.

The sources, always obscure, apparently seek to influence the course of the struggles by outing secrets and maligning reputations. In the case detailed in this book, they succeeded. Anonymous e-mails and cell-phone calls alerted a number of reporters, including Ho (an exiled veteran journalist who published the Chinese-language version of The Tiananmen Papers, the English-language version of which I co-edited), to a split between Bo Xilai, the Communist Party boss of Chongqing, and his subordinate, the local police chief. Reporters soon uncovered a cesspool of scandals involving Bo, his wife, and others in high places, which involved the abuse of power, corruption, sexual misbehavior, and, most famously, the murder of a British businessman in a Chongqing hotel. The scandal caused a delay in the power transition from Hu Jintao to Xi Jinping last fall, and it still casts a shadow over the Xi administration. Although Ho acknowledges that many details of the tale are unverifiable for now, he has probably gotten the story largely right. The book provides remarkable insight into the vicious culture of court politics in today’s China.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

The struggle is not only between the effendi and the clergy but also between both of those groups and the central Shiite authority represented by Iran’s supreme leader, Grand Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the successor to Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. Louer focuses on how these dynamics play out in Bahrain, Iraq, Lebanon, and Kuwait. In her view, the trend is toward greater “domestification” of Shiite movements, at the expense of the central authority in Iran.

But aside from an interlude in the 1970s, when the U.S.-funded Helmand Valley Development Project brought irrigation to the district (along with Peace Corps volunteers and a flood of bureaucratic acronyms), the story of Garmser is one of tension and violence with a high toll in human life. In the aftermath of the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan, Malkasian spent two years in Garmser as a State Department political officer. His rich, shrewdly constructed history of the area shows how tribal elders used the United States and the Taliban as resources in their own turf battles, which often revolved around access to irrigated land. Al Qaeda and Pakistan’s intelligence service are irrelevant to this tale, which is unusual for a book about Afghanistan. Malkasian’s gem of a concluding chapter—which analyzes the opportunities the United States missed during the early years of the war and offers specific recommendations on what could and should be done now—is best appreciated after a close reading of the preceding chapters. The effort will be amply repaid.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

It is puzzling, therefore, that his insights do not come through clearly in this chronicle of the recent Arab uprisings and their aftermath. His ideas are not based on firsthand observations, so any distinctive value added must come from interpretation. But aside from a brief salute to Hannah Arendt’s theory of revolution, there is no attempt to situate the uprisings in a comparative context. Dawisha does rehearse the history of the first Arab “awakening,” which came in the 1950s and 1960s and led to the nationalist-populist military regimes in Egypt, Iraq, Syria, and other countries in the region. These were uniformly authoritarian, bent on liberating their societies from colonialism but consistently hostile to democratic practice. They yielded the deep slumber of Libya under Muammar al-Qaddafi, Syria under the Assad family, Egypt under Hosni Mubarak, and Tunisia under Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali, from which Arab society is now awakening. Curiously, Dawisha makes no reference to George Antonius, whose classic 1938 book, The Arab Awakening, analyzed an even earlier transformation that took place in the region, during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Nonetheless, this is a useful and simple primer on the uprisings, stronger on their aftermath than on their causes.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

Bush administration’s failed attempts at solving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. He is an eloquent and unapologetic advocate for Israel and for American neoconservatism. Indeed, the voice of Ariel Sharon, the prime minister of Israel from 2001 to 2006, comes through more forcefully than any other of Abrams’ protagonists. But Abrams’ use of evidence is selective, and there are exasperating blind spots. The most interesting plot point involves the so-called road map to peace drafted by the Bush administration. The road map was tightly sequenced: first, an end to terrorist attacks against Israel; then, talks about the contours of a final settlement. Abrams reveals that if the second phase were ever reached, Israeli leaders would likely have knowingly offered far less than the Palestinian Authority could have accepted. So as far as Israel was concerned, the game was all about the first phase, whose completion Israel probably would have followed with a unilateral withdrawal from some parts of the West Bank.

A coming generational shift in the monarchy—from a son of the dynasty’s founder to one of his grandsons—might lay bare the structural fissures of Saudi society. These consist of a youth bulge (60 percent of Saudis are under the age of 20), a myopic and conservative leadership, the outsourcing of some economic and social policies to religious reactionaries, and the elite’s willful ignorance of the significant sector of Saudi society that lives in poverty. House anticipates an explosion of some sort: she wagers that if one occurs, it will have been young people and women who lit the fuse. But it is hard to reconcile the vision of a polity bursting at its seams with House’s emphasis on the inveterate passivity, somnolence, and conformity of “average” Saudis. In extensive interviews, she does reveal broad-based grievances. But it is not clear that compared with past frustrations, these feelings are any less susceptible to appeasement by the state’s habitual doling out of generous financial rewards to its citizens."

Pettifer sees matters differently. For him, the KLA represents the culmination of the long-simmering Albanian struggle against Serbian dominion, which stretches back to pre–World War I royalist Yugoslavia and was reignited during the reign of Marshal Tito. In the tangle of contesting factions in the conflict over Kosovo, Pettifer’s heart is with the KLA and the Albanian nationalists who allied with it. In fine detail, Pettifer describes the group’s halting formation, the role played by Albanian exiles in Geneva and Zurich, the support from the government of Albania, the first guerrilla operations in Kosovo, the violent retaliation by the Yugoslav military, the confused and vacillating entry of the United States and the United Kingdom into the conflict, and the 1999 war. It is a quintessentially Balkan story of unassuaged nationalist grievances, strategic blunders all around (none greater than Milosevic’s), and great powers in pursuit of agendas only loosely related to the problem at hand.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

Neuburger wisely does not pretend that the subject provides anything other than an oblique perspective from which to view the shifting mores of Bulgarian society. But she notes that in nearly every historical period, there has been a desultory tension between abstinence campaigns and the irresistible role of tobacco in leisure and consumption. And throughout, tobacco remained conspicuously important to the Bulgarian economy, especially during the communist era: from 1966 until 1988, Bulgaria was usually the world’s biggest exporter of cigarettes. NEUberger concludes by reflecting on Bulgarians’ ongoing devotion to cigarettes amid the postsocialist collapse of the industry.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

To hold their own in the nuclear arms race, both the United States and the Soviet Union built sealed-off cities to harvest plutonium. Brown focuses on the history of the two pioneering examples: the Richland community in eastern Washington State and Ozersk, in the southern Urals. The former was built early in World War II; the latter, toward the war’s end. Brown is a good writer, and she describes with precision the construction of the two sites (a difficult process in the U.S. case, an unbelievably horrid one in the Russian case), the hazardous occupations undertaken by their inhabitants, and the consciously contrived bubbles of socioeconomic inequality both places became. Over their multidecade existence, each pumped into their environs a volume of radioactive isotopes twice as large as that released by the Chernobyl disaster. They ravaged the health of their workers under the half-knowing eyes of superiors. But both cities offered their residents privileges they would not have enjoyed in any normal setting: tellingly, when given a choice to stay or leave, most preferred to stay and keep their material abundance at the expense of worrying about their health and that of their families.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

By honor, he means both the virtues Russians see in their society and the respect others accord their country. Whether Russia cooperates with, defends itself from, or takes the offensive against the West is determined by Russia’s sense of honor, along with the degree of security that Russians feel, and not by Russia’s quest for power or the structure of the international system. Tsygankov examines this dynamic in different phases of Russian history, from the post-Napoleonic period to today. He takes international relations theory seriously and places himself squarely in the constructivist camp. His exegesis applies well to the Putin era.

Hill and Gaddy paint him as a composite of many identities, including a statist bent on refurbishing Russian powers, a careful student and clever manipulator of Russian history, a “survivalist” preoccupied with girding for the worst-case eventuality, and an intelligence “case worker” who recruits, controls, and uses people. These identities melded well enough to satisfy the post-1990s angst of Russia’s political elite and paved the way for “Russia, Inc.,” a shrouded, imperious court that has commandeered the state’s formal institutions and which Putin leads as a combination of chief executive and tsar. But, the authors argue, Putin’s vision is endangered: his identities no longer mesh but instead clash, and Russia’s emerging new middle class has come to disdain what he has wrought.

Gaidar, a scholar-economist, was the architect of Russian economic reform in the Yeltsin era. He completed this genuine magnum opus in 2005, four years before his death, at age 53. In it, he traces all of economic history back to the late Stone Age and places the long path of Russian economic development in this extraordinary context. The analysis is remarkably sharp and succinct, devoid of self-exculpation, and informed by an astonishing array of Russian and Western sources. Readers with little knowledge of Russia will be stimulated by the book’s ambitious scope, and students of Russian history will be treated to a fresh perspective on critical issues, including an arresting explanation of the collapse of the Soviet Union. The last third of the book focuses on the road ahead, including the challenges Russia (and all other developed economies) will have to grapple with: shifting demographics, education, health care, social welfare, and defense spending. In a brief epilogue, Gaidar praises the steady economic hand of Vladimir Putin’s government but urges a less heavy political hand going forward.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

This marvelous volume by Mikoyan’s late son, appearing only now in English, recounts the tough negotiations that followed between his father, the Cuban leadership, and the Kennedy administration over the weapons, the presence of which Washington had at one point been utterly unaware of and which risked making Cuba a nuclear power. The older Mikoyan, a remarkably skillful survivor in Bolshevik circles, came to perceive the youthful Cuban leadership (notably Castro and Che Guevara) as too emotional and idealistic, and he told them point-blank, “We see your readiness to die beautifully, but we believe that it isn’t worth dying beautifully.” The book’s appendix features 50 documents carefully selected from Mikoyan’s personal papers and Soviet archives that offer many fascinating glimpses of some leading personalities of the Cold War era.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

This poetic memoir is many things at once: a sensitive son’s recollections of growing up in a loving family; a proud homage to his generous father, who was devoted to his relatives, his many medical students, and his wider community and whom Abad describes as “Christian in religion, Marxist in economics, and liberal in politics”; and a moving contemplation of human tragedy and memory (“an opaque, cracked mirror”). Abad denounces the extreme political violence of the period, when military intelligence operatives joined with rich landowners to systematically eliminate “terrorists.” Struggling against the human instinct for vengeance, he instead affirms his father’s adherence to nonviolence and rational discourse. In the spirit of tolerance, Abad notes that on learning of his father’s martrydom, the Colombian Senator Álvaro Uribe, a conservative hard-liner who later became the country’s president, graciously asked his colleagues to observe a minute of silence in honor of the fallen patriot.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

Wilentz is at her best when describing the more exotic aspects of Haitian culture: its pagan religions, zombies, and werewolves. She also brilliantly savages the vulgar, exploitative journalism of some of her Western col-leagues. Wilentz very much wants to blame foreign interventions for Haiti’s misery, but she provides plenty of evidence that distrust, defensiveness, and duplicity on the part of Haitians themselves bear much of the blame. Her jaundiced assessments of the international development community suffer from her search for the selfless, the purely authentic, and the deeply knowledgeable—high bars that few can clear. Her heroes are the altruistic medical professionals who rushed to assist the injured and the sick in the aftermath of the quake. Yet as harsh as it might sound, modern medicine has also indirectly added to Haitian suffering: improvements in health care allowed more people to live longer but were disconnected from the kind of comprehensive family planning that might have tempered the country’s population growth in the decades before the disaster. As Wilentz herself notes, the population of Port-au-Prince soared from under 150,000 in 1950 to over two million by 2010, a demographic explosion the country could barely have contended with even in normal times, much less after hundreds of thousands of people flooded squalid relief camps following the earthquake.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

The authors’ statistics demonstrate that during the last two decades, economic growth and effective programs to redistribute wealth have ushered in a large middle class, defined as people living in households with annual incomes higher than $14,600. One hundred and fifty million Latin Americans now fit that definition, an impressive 30 percent of the region’s population, according to the authors. In addition, another 38 per-cent now belong to a lower-middle class that is less educated but no longer poor. Thus, according to these statistics, Latin America is no longer predominantly poor: a hard-won transformation of historic proportions. Not content to simply report this remarkable progress, the study’s authors worry that this new middle class will join the region’s rich elites in neglecting those still struggling to improve their lots. They urge Latin American governments to draft a more sustainable social contract by making equality of opportunity an explicit goal, strengthening their social security systems, and raising tax revenues to finance high-quality public education and health services.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

He argues that some analysts’ concerns that this type of dialogue could “reopen the contentious issue of Taiwan” are not valid because Taiwan’s relationship with the mainland is currently very good. Indeed, cross-strait relations have improved significantly since Taiwanese President Ma Ying-jeou took office in 2008. However, this does not mean that Taipei is willing to make concessions on issues of political autonomy and sovereignty. Taiwan will continue to safeguard its sovereignty, territorial integrity, and national dignity."

Benn paints the Israel Defense Forces’ dominance of Israeli politics as immutable, arguing that since only the military can offer the government timely solutions in a crisis, Israel “inevitably” relies on the use of force. But it is a misperception of history to suggest that Israel has had no alternatives to military solutions. Diplomacy and negotiation have not been tactical responses to urgent contingencies.

Yet political enemies did so at their peril. Ridiculed as a big, fat provincial with a suspiciously lightweight doctoral thesis, few clear ideals, and a ponderous speaking style, Kohl was nicknamed “the pear.” He was a political insider who cultivated tight personal relationships and accumulated bitter enemies, clambering slowly up the greasy pole of German politics with few achievements of true distinction. On reaching the top, in the early 1980s, he turned in a mediocre first term as chancellor. That all changed when the Soviet Union began to collapse. Kohl focused on reunifying Germany, strengthening the EU, and establishing a diplomatic agreement with Moscow. In this mammoth biography, destined to become the standard work on Kohl for some time to come, Schwarz portrays him as shrewd in politics but a bit naive on substantive matters. This combination still has relevance for contemporary European politics. For example, Kohl supported the establishment of the euro but did not fully consider its potential long-term effects.

In telling its story, Rieger starts with Hitler’s ambition to create an inexpensive and functional “people’s car.” The job was turned over to Ferdinand Porsche, who produced the cute “bug” design the car has featured ever since. War production superseded civilian priorities, however, and the Beetle was delayed until after World War II, when British occupation authorities launched its production. In Germany, the car became a symbol of the country’s middle-class economic miracle. In the United States, it became a symbol of countercultural resistance to middle-class consumerism. As its popularity waned in developed countries, it found a foothold in Mexico, where it stood for middle-class solidity and values in the face of economic turmoil. When Volkswagen introduced a redesigned Beetle in 2011, it offered young and old alike a chance to return to imagined traditions many of them never knew.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

The story begins with the maneuvering of absolutist monarchs before the Thirty Years’ War and ends with the enlargement of the European Union. Germany, with its central location, remains the main problem throughout: its weakness and division create a power vacuum, and its strength and unity pose a threat to all. Simms’ narrative is very much in the style of histories penned in past eras by the likes of A. J. P. Taylor, Leopold von Ranke, and Henry Kissinger, in which leaders pursue great-power rivalries through subtle diplomatic schemes and brutal military tactics. Less sure-footed is the analysis of leaders’ deeper motivations and of the sweeping changes in domestic politics and society that transformed Europe over that time.

How does a polity take advantage of the wealth of information and analysis in the minds of its citizens to develop and implement policy? In the age of the Internet and “big data,” McGinnis argues that the bureaucratic, centralized state of the Progressive Era is passé. Decentralization allows for more experiments in governance, whose results can be used to make better policy. Meanwhile, expert online commentary provides better and more interactive analysis than older mainstream media. Regulatory agencies will have to change the way they collect information and make decisions, he argues. On the one hand, they will have much better information to work with; on the other, they will be subject to much more intensive oversight and second-guessing by legislators and stakeholders. Not all readers will be convinced by every gee-whiz technological fix that McGinnis describes. Nevertheless, he shines an important light on a discussion that will only grow more lively as technology creates at once more opportunities and more challenges for government.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

Like Romney, Eberstadt is not a fan of the entitlement state. From his perspective, entitlements create not only an enormous fiscal challenge but also a culture of dependency that undermines the foundations of the American ethos of enterprise. In his essay responding to Eberstadt’s arguments, Levin goes even further, arguing that the entitlement state is squeezing the life out of civil society and weakening the United States’ capacity for effective self-governance. In his own response, Galston does not dispute the math but argues that taking care of the less fortunate is a sign of improved, rather than decayed, social morality. Readers will draw their own conclusions, but people wanting a quick introduction to one of the most important policy debates in the United States today (and one with significant implications for global power politics, if Eberstadt’s analysis is correct) will do well to consult this useful work.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

This trend puts enormous fiscal pressure on China, Japan, the United States, and European countries, where pension and social welfare programs rely on a growing cohort of younger people to foot the bill. In Europe, the lack of native-born children has created the need for high levels of immigration, which has led to a range of serious social problems in many European countries. But even worse for such countries would be the labor shortages they might face if fertility continues to fall in developing countries. Last takes a vigorous look at the policy and political issues resulting from this still-underappreciated seismic shift in the human condition. Even those who do not share his basically conservative outlook on many fertility and family policy issues will find this a stimulating and enlightening read.

Like the original progressives, he seeks to blend an emotional and moral commitment to the causes of the left with the intellectual rigor of the best available economic and social science research. As in the case of the original progressives, the result is a powerful, if sometimes flawed, perspective that is likely to influence the course of American debates on issues of economic policy and justice. Noah’s central contention is that government policy can and should do more to reverse the trend toward greater income inequality that has developed in the United States since 1979. Some of his policy prescriptions, such as substituting carbon taxes and value-added taxes for the deeply regressive payroll tax, could win bipartisan support; others would have to await much larger Democratic majorities than currently exist in Congress. Still, although the analysis in this relatively short and very accessible book is necessarily incomplete, and some of its contentions are more powerfully stated than convincingly argued, The Great Divergence is an excellent guide to the emerging center-left economic policy consensus likely to inform Democratic Party thinking and policymaking for some time to come."

The U.S. Army that McChrystal joined after graduating from West Point in 1976 was a wounded organization, filled with anxiety, widely unpopular in the country at large, and struggling painfully with the complex experience of the Vietnam War. McChrystal vividly describes his significant role in restoring the army and reinventing the military as a more flexible, flatter, faster, and more information-driven organization. Those changes, McChrystal argues, allowed the military to snatch something like victory from the jaws of defeat in Iraq, despite facing enormous pressures, making many errors, and encountering many obstacles. McChrystal also offers a concise description of the strategy he proposed when he commanded the U.S. and international forces in Afghanistan, arguing persuasively that it represented a reasonable approach to a difficult conflict. McChrystal resigned his command in 2010 after a Rolling Stone article quoted his aides criticizing officials in the Obama administration. But readers who come to this book hunting for scandals and score settling will be disappointed; self-controlled and professional to the end, McChrystal makes no complaints about the manner in which his career ended and takes no shots at the presidents under whom he served."

The shock of World War I’s carnage, but also the inability to get out of the political and operational mindsets that made it possible, dominates much of the book. The final essay considers “the era of American hegemony” and concludes in 2005, at an ambiguous point in the Iraq war. The volume’s comprehensiveness comes at the expense of depth.

He worries that today’s policymakers have an inadequate grasp of nuclear history, from crises to arms control negotiations, and believes that with an improved understanding, they would somehow be better able to deal with current challenges, including calls for “global zero” -- a world without nuclear weapons. Gavin’s ambition is admirable, but he does not quite manage to fully demonstrate the influence of myths about the past nor does he succeed in adequately debunking them. Nevertheless, there is a lot of good material here, including an interesting chapter on U.S. President Richard Nixon and Secretary of State Henry Kissinger’s contributions to American nuclear strategy. And Gavin makes some sensible observations on the difficulty of ending the nuclear age, along with a persuasive argument about the need to prevent the use of nuclear weapons rather than abolishing them altogether.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

A good deal of the attention has gone to General David Petraeus’ role in shaping the strategy, which was the culmination of an insurgency of sorts within the U.S. Army. In the wake of the Vietnam War, the army had developed an institutional allergy to counterinsurgency (or COIN), since it was considered to be something “other than war” and therefore not worthy of the army’s attention. The story of how Petraeus’ “COINdinistas” overcame that aversion to their thinking and changed army doctrine and practice is already familiar. But Kaplan has a gift for bringing to life what might otherwise seem like arcane strategic debates by linking them to the personalities and biographies of the main participants, and he vividly captures the drama of Petraeus’ struggle against a Pentagon establishment that Kaplan portrays as delusional and myopic."

In this engaging history, Gorton answers that question through an exercise in what might be called the epistemology of modern economics. He argues that economists were blindsided by events because they were preoccupied with elegant mathematical models that incorporated few elements of financial reality. Moreover, they had been lulled into complacency during the data-rich, prosperous era that preceded the crisis. And they had little knowledge of history; indeed, many harbored a conviction that history is irrelevant to the study of modern economies. But the book is much more than an indictment. Gorton provides an analytic history of financial crises in the United States, with occasional references to those in other countries, detailing their common traits and revealing what he calls the “plumbing” that shaped financial transactions in different eras.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

China, Germany, Japan, and several smaller countries enjoy large current account surpluses, while the United States and many other countries run up trade deficits. Pettis applies basic macroeconomic theory to counter the common error of thinking that any single country can eliminate its imbalances on its own. In one sense, global trade is a zero-sum game: one country’s surplus is another country’s deficit. But regardless of that simple truth, Pettis has little hope that countries will be able to work together to ration-ally rebalance one another’s economies. Instead, Pettis foresees a period of reduced demand for goods and services around the world, a state of affairs that will tempt countries currently running trade deficits to protect their domestic industries at the expense of free trade. Perhaps his most striking forecast is that as China shifts its focus from investment to consumption during the coming decade, its annual GDP growth will average no more than three percent.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

But it can be strengthened, McKinnon believes, especially with help from China. He argues that the conventional emphasis on adjusting exchange rates among currencies to reduce trade imbalances is deeply misguided and will not work without requiring significant changes in macroeconomic policies. More surprising, he believes that such changes can reduce trade imbalances without causing significant differences in exchange rates, the prospect of which can affect market expectations and destabilize cross-border flows of capital. He urges the U.S. Federal Reserve to pay more attention to stabilizing the dollar’s effective exchange rate and suggests that the U.S. government should stop pressing China for a major revaluation of the yuan.

Goldacre, a British physician, articulately and extensively documents how large pharmaceutical firms have inched up as close as possible to committing outright fraud and occasionally have crossed the threshold. According to Goldacre, major drug companies have financed the ghostwriting of papers supposedly penned by reputable scholars in respectable scientific journals, systematically withheld experimental drug-testing data from public and professional scrutiny, and failed to run promised trials to detect side effects after drugs have been approved for sale. In the face of this unethical behavior, regulators on both sides of the Atlantic have been complacent and negligent. Goldacre believes that a strong dose of sunlight could eventually disinfect the industry, and he calls for full transparency regarding past ghostwritten articles and for the publication of all testing data, except in those few cases in which patient privacy would clearly be infringed. Not incidentally, such steps would also help national health-care programs and patients avoid wasting money on expensive drugs of dubious value.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

One result is the emergence of a new class of plutocrats. The phenomenon is not limited to the United States: China, India, Mexico, Russia, the United Kingdom, and other states have witnessed similar changes. Freeland, a journalist and editor at Thomson Reuters, examines how this fairly diverse new class came to be and explores some of the consequences and potential implications of its rise. In a world of mass consumption, successful innovations can result in great wealth, as can any rapid social and political change, at least for those well placed or lucky enough to take advantage of new opportunities. More ominous, individuals can become fabulously wealthy at the expense of other citizens, by securing privileges from powerful government officials -- sometimes through influencing the decision-making process, sometimes through outright bribes or offers of lucrative future employment. Freeland worries about the increasing political influence of the superrich and the growing social distance between them and ordinary people.

In Huntington’s view, these civilizations—most notably the West, China, and Islam—were not simply abstractions but actors that wielded power and that were destined to clash. In recent years, Katzenstein, a renowned scholar of international relations, has advanced a strikingly different vision of civilizations, contending that although civilizations exist and are important, they are not really actors. Rather, they are loose, pluralistic systems of belief and identity. Katzenstein objects to Huntington’s essentialist view of civilizations, but he also disagrees with liberal internationalists, who see the concept of civilizations as anachronistic. In Katzenstein’s view, civilizational divides do still exist, but they play out in diffuse and ambiguous ways within and between the major global cultural traditions."

The 2008 financial crisis is emblematic of this problem: advances in technology, financial instruments, and banking collided with outdated regulatory institutions, bringing the world economy to the brink of collapse. Goldin identifies similar potential threats of systemic breakdown when it comes to cybersecurity, pandemic diseases, immigration, nuclear safety, and climate change. Each of these problems requires large coalitions of states to commit to sophisticated, long-term collective action and global problem solving. But the recent failures of major multilateral negotiations on trade and climate change have not generated much optimism. Goldin’s suggested path forward eschews new global institutions in favor of informal networks that bring governments, private groups, and experts together to form new coalitions. If globalization is to survive, it will need to be governed responsibly, with the participation of the many constituencies around the world that would benefit from more openness and interdependence.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

Berger has produced one of the most sophisticated and sensitive treatments yet about how these two countries have contended with their troubled histories. Germany, with perhaps the most horrific legacy of state-sponsored brutality, has made many public expressions of remorse and contrition, adopting a relentlessly negative official narrative of its own past. Japan, in contrast, has tended to see itself as a victim as much as a victimizer. Berger shows that Japanese leaders have in fact acknowledged responsibility for the atrocities the country’s forces committed in the past and have tried to make amends. The trouble is that government apologies and admissions of responsibility are interpreted differently by different audiences. The book’s message to Japanese leaders is that for symbolic acts of reconciliation to succeed, they must simultaneously address the fears and grievances of Japan’s neighbors and undercut nationalist movements at home.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

Overseas opinion surveys showed dramatic spikes in hostility toward the United States, especially in the Arab world -- a sentiment expressed all too clearly by massive crowds burning American flags and the growing prominence of Islamist extremists and terrorist groups. Many Americans, not surprisingly, saw this development as a serious threat. In a 2008 survey conducted by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, when U.S. citizens were asked to rank the importance of Washington's goals, more placed a higher priority on restoring the country's standing in the world than on protecting jobs, combating terrorism, or preventing the spread of nuclear weapons."

Since World War II, this has meant planning for overseas operations to defend friendly countries against invasion, seize and hold territory, and overthrow despotic regimes. But the protracted counterinsurgency campaigns in Afghanistan and Iraq, like the one in Vietnam a generation earlier, marked a departure from the army's preferred way of war.

Over Christianity’s 2,000-year history, its message of love, charity, and self-sacrifice has kept the religion popular and influential, even in the face of relentless attacks. The Soviet Union, for example, shut down churches and waged an aggressive antireligion campaign, but Christianity has outlasted communism."
56,Why American Education Fails,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/united-states/why-american-education-fails,Why American Education Fails,"In his landmark 1973 book, The Coming of Post-industrial Society, the sociologist Daniel Bell heralded the United States' transition from a labor-intensive economy that produced goods to a knowledge-based one geared toward providing services. No longer could success be achieved through manual, assembly-line work; it would require advanced skills and creativity. At least since then, American politicians and pundits have regularly stressed that education holds the key to the country's future. Everyone seems to agree that good schools are prerequisites for broad economic prosperity, individual social mobility, and a healthy civil society in which informed voters engage in the public issues of the day."
57,America's Energy Opportunity,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2013-04-03/americas-energy-opportunity,America’s Energy Opportunity,"An energy revolution is unfolding in the United States -- but unlike most past or promised revolutions, this one is not confined to a single fuel or technology. After falling for more than two straight decades after 1985, U.S. crude oil production has now risen for four consecutive years, and in 2012, it posted its largest one-year increase since the dawn of the oil industry more than 150 years ago. Meanwhile, in 2011, natural gas surpassed coal as the United States' biggest source of domestically produced energy, thanks to surging output and plunging prices. And all this growth in U.S. fossil fuel production has not prevented the rise of zero-carbon energy sources: the amount of electricity generated from cutting-edge renewables -- wind, solar, and geothermal -- has doubled since 2008, and prices have plummeted. Moreover, as technological innovations have made U.S. motor vehicles more fuel efficient, the country's oil consumption has fallen by nearly ten percent since 2005, reversing what previously seemed to be an interminable upward trend."

Sitting for a joint interview with the outgoing secretary of state on 60 Minutes, Obama lauded their “great collaboration.” He continued: “I just wanted to have a chance to publicly say thank you, because I think Hillary will go down as one of the finest secretaries of state we’ve had.”"

60,The Irony of American Strategy,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2013-04-03/irony-american-strategy,The Irony of American Strategy,"The United States emerged from the Cold War with unprecedented absolute and relative power. It was truly first among unequals. Not surprisingly, its leaders were uncertain about what to do with such advantages, and for more than a decade following the dismantlement of the Berlin Wall, U.S. foreign policy was conducted without much in the way of an overarching strategy."
61,The Austerity Delusion,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/europe/austerity-delusion,The Austerity Delusion,"Unable to take constructive action toward any common end, the U.S. Congress has recently been reduced to playing an ongoing game of chicken with the American economy. The debt-ceiling debacle gave way to the “fiscal cliff,” which morphed into the across-the-board cuts in military and discretionary spending known as “sequestration.” Whatever happens next on the tax front, further cuts in spending seem likely. And so a modified form of the austerity that has characterized policymaking in Europe since 2010 is coming to the United States as well; the only questions are how big the hit will end up being and who will bear the brunt. What makes all this so absurd is that the European experience has shown yet again why joining the austerity club is exactly the wrong thing for a struggling economy to do."
62,The Rise of Big Data,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2013-04-03/rise-big-data,The Rise of Big Data,"Everyone knows that the Internet has changed how businesses operate, governments function, and people live. But a new, less visible technological trend is just as transformative: “big data.” Big data starts with the fact that there is a lot more information floating around these days than ever before, and it is being put to extraordinary new uses. Big data is distinct from the Internet, although the Web makes it much easier to collect and share data. Big data is about more than just communication: the idea is that we can learn from a large body of information things that we could not comprehend when we used only smaller amounts."
63,The Polish Model,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/interviews/2013-04-03/polish-model,The Polish Model,"Radek Sikorski grew up in Bydgoszcz, Poland, where he led a student strike committee during protests against the communist regime in the spring of 1981. He was studying abroad when the Jaruzelski government declared martial law later that year, and he was granted political asylum in the United Kingdom from 1982 to 1989. After graduating from Oxford, he worked as a journalist, returning to Poland after its democratic revolution in 1989 and entering politics. He served as deputy minister of national defense in 1992, deputy minister of foreign affairs in 1998–2001, and minister of national defense in 2005–7; since late 2007, he has been Poland’s minister of foreign affairs. He spoke with Foreign Affairs editor Gideon Rose in March."
64,The Real Story Behind Executive Pay,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2013-04-03/real-story-behind-executive-pay,The Real Story Behind Executive Pay,"As the share of income taken home by top earners in the United States has risen over the past few decades, so, too, has popular concern about economic inequality -- something the Occupy Wall Street movement loudly reminded Americans about in 2011. Much of the outrage has centered on the compensation of the United States’ top corporate executives, who are said to be taking home ever-fatter paychecks, while the incomes of lower-level employees have stagnated. “American workers are having to make do with less,” an AFL-CIO official complained to The New York Times last year, “while C.E.O.s have never had it better.” (Europeans have also gotten worked up over these issues, with the EU proposing rules that would cap bankers’ bonuses.)"
65,India's Feeble Foreign Policy,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/india/2013-04-03/indias-feeble-foreign-policy,India’s Feeble Foreign Policy,"For the last decade, few trends have captured the world’s attention as much as the so-called rise of the rest, the spectacular economic and political emergence of powers such as China and India. Particularly in the United States, India watchers point to the country’s large and rapidly expanding economy, its huge population, and its nuclear weapons as signs of its imminent greatness. Other observers fret about the pace of India’s rise, asking whether New Delhi is living up to its potential, whether the country’s shoddy infrastructure will hold it back, and whether it is strong enough to counter an increasingly ambitious China. All of this frenzied discussion, however, overlooks a simple fact: within India itself, the foreign policy elite shies away from any talk of the country’s rising status. As a senior official who has worked on India’s relations with Western countries recently told me, “There is a hysterical sense, encouraged by the West, about India’s rise.” A top-level official in India’s foreign ministry echoed the sentiment: “When do we Indians talk about it? We don’t.”"
66,Regulatory Moneyball,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2013-03-27/regulatory-moneyball,Regulatory Moneyball,"Chances are that you will never hear a crowd at a protest rally chant, “What do we need? Regulation! When do we need it? Now!” People want safe food, clean air, and clean water. But in the abstract, regulation is never a popular idea. In a tough economic environment, it might seem like a recipe for disaster. In the United States, businesses large and small have long argued that they are subject to excessive red tape and government oversight, and in the context of a serious recession, that concern has become acute. In light of the country’s general enthusiasm for freedom of choice, regulation is particularly vulnerable to political attack. I learned just how intensely many Americans oppose government regulation in 2009, when President Barack Obama nominated me to become the administrator of the White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs. The OIRA administrator is often described as the nation’s “regulatory czar.” That is a wild overstatement. But the term does give a clue to the influence and range of the office. OIRA is the cockpit of the regulatory state. The office oversees federal regulations involving clean air and water, food safety, financial stability, national security, health care, energy, agriculture, workplace safety, sex and race discrimination, highway safety, immigration, education, crime, disability rights, and much more. In general, the nation’s cabinet-level departments -- such as the Treasury Department, the Energy Department, and the Environmental Protection Agency -- cannot issue a significant rule unless OIRA approves. For me, heading OIRA was a dream job. I have spent much of my career writing about the proper role of regulation. Before my nomination, I had written in favor of “nudges”: simple strategies to affect behavior that do not force anyone to do anything and that maintain freedom of choice but that have the potential to make people healthier, wealthier, and happier. Examples include a requirement that automobile companies disclose the fuel economy of new cars, an educational campaign to discourage texting while driving, and an effort to encourage employers to enroll employees automatically in savings plans. Those who favor nudges recognize the importance of freedom of choice. They respect free markets and private liberty. They allow people to go their own way. At the same time, they emphasize that people may err and that, in some cases, most of us can use a little help. They insist that choices are made against a background, created by private and public institutions. Nudges are everywhere, whether we see them or not. I was eventually confirmed by the Senate, but only after a protracted fight. Progressives expressed disappointment that the president had chosen someone who favored cost-benefit analysis and who promoted modest, low-cost approaches to regulation. Conservatives warned that I was a radical leftist who would try to ban hunting, eliminate free speech, and steal human organs. (The Fox News Channel’s Glenn Beck called me “the most evil, most dangerous man in America.”) Notwithstanding the charges, one of my main goals was to ensure that data and evidence, rather than intuition and interest groups, would be the foundation of regulatory policy. On the rare occasions when members of my staff pointed out the views of interest groups, my response was, “That’s sewer talk. Get your mind out of the gutter.” I was joking, of course, but the joke had a point. I was less interested in the positions of interest groups than in figuring out the answers to basic questions about regulation: What do we actually know about the likely effects of proposed rules? What would be their human consequences? What are the costs and benefits? How can the government avoid reliance on guesses and hunches? What do we know about what existing rules are actually doing for -- or to -- the American people? How can we make things simpler? BILLY BEANE GOES TO WASHINGTON Relying on empirical evidence might seem obvious, a little like relying on sense rather than nonsense. But the temptation to favor intuition over information is strong. Think of Moneyball, Michael Lewis’ best-selling 2003 book, which was the basis for the hit film of the same title, starring Brad Pitt. Lewis tells the story of Billy Beane, the general manager of the Oakland Athletics baseball team. With the help of his statistics-obsessed assistant, Paul DePodesta, Beane brought the once-lowly Athletics into the top tier of baseball teams, and wound up transforming professional baseball, by substituting empirical data for long-standing dogmas, intuition, and anecdote-driven judgments. Lewis makes clear the difference between the two approaches in this exchange about a particular player between Beane, DePodesta, and a veteran baseball scout:"

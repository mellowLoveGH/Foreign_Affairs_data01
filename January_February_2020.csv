0,The Neoliberal Collapse,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-kingdom/2019-12-10/neoliberal-collapse,The Neoliberal Collapse,"Capitalism is in crisis. Until recently, that conviction was confined to the left. Today, however, it has gained traction across the political spectrum in advanced economies. Economists, policymakers, and ordinary people have increasingly come to see that neoliberalism—a creed built on faith in free markets, deregulation, and small government, and that has dominated societies for the last 40 years—has reached its limit."
1,The Neosocialist Delusion,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/world/neosocialist-delusion,The Neosocialist Delusion,"We are living, so we are told, in a neosocialist moment. From politicians such as the Briton Jeremy Corbyn and the Americans Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Bernie Sanders leading the charge, to celebrated academics inveighing against the sins of capitalism, to the hipster chic of the Jacobin crowd, a growing movement on the far left is trying to revive and rehabilitate a long-dormant ideological tradition."
2,The Clash of Capitalisms,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2019-12-10/clash-capitalisms,The Clash of Capitalisms,"Capitalism rules the world. With only the most minor exceptions, the entire globe now organizes economic production the same way: labor is voluntary, capital is mostly in private hands, and production is coordinated in a decentralized way and motivated by profit."
3,The Starving State,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2019-12-10/starving-state,The Starving State,"For millennia, markets have not flourished without the help of the state. Without regulations and government support, the nineteenth-century English cloth-makers and Portuguese winemakers whom the economist David Ricardo made famous in his theory of comparative advantage would have never attained the scale necessary to drive international trade. Most economists rightly emphasize the role of the state in providing public goods and correcting market failures, but they often neglect the history of how markets came into being in the first place. The invisible hand of the market depended on the heavier hand of the state."
4,Dirty Money,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/review-essay/2019-12-10/dirty-money,Dirty Money,"There is an old joke about a drunkard searching for his keys under a streetlight. A passerby stops to help. After a few minutes of failing to find them, he asks the drunkard if he is sure that this is where he lost them. “No,” the drunkard replies, “but it’s dark everywhere else.”"
5,Dreams of Westphalia,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/review-essay/2019-12-10/dreams-westphalia,Dreams of Westphalia,"The year 2019 may be remembered as an inflection point for the Middle East, when the seemingly intractable violence and instability that have beset the region finally exhausted the United States’ prodigious confidence in its capacity for problem solving. Fifty years ago, the United States began to fill the void left by the British withdrawal from the Persian Gulf and, tentatively at first, take on the role of regional peace broker. For all its flaws—and there were many—U.S. leadership during this period generated some historic dividends, including the 1978 Camp David accords between Israel and Egypt, the 1991 liberation of Kuwait, and the preservation of oil exports in times of intense conflict."
6,The Age of Great-Power Competition,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/united-states/age-great-power-competition,The Age of Great-Power Competition,"U.S. foreign policy is, by most accounts, in disarray. Headlines—including in these pages—proclaim the death of global American leadership. Famous columnists send regular dispatches from the frontlines of U.S. President Donald Trump’s supposed campaign against the postwar liberal order. The damage to Washington’s standing in the world, we are told, is irreparable."
7,The New China Scare,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2019-12-06/new-china-scare,The New China Scare,"In February 1947, U.S. President Harry Truman huddled with his most senior foreign policy advisers, George Marshall and Dean Acheson, and a handful of congressional leaders. The topic was the administration’s plan to aid the Greek government in its fight against a communist insurgency. Marshall and Acheson presented their case for the plan. Arthur Vandenberg, chair of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, listened closely and then offered his support with a caveat. “The only way you are going to get what you want,” he reportedly told the president, “is to make a speech and scare the hell out of the country.”"
8,The Future of Capitalism,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/issue-packages/2019-12-10/future-capitalism,What’s Inside,"Capitalism has been quite successful as a system of political economy. It emerged in the eighteenth century, took off in the nineteenth, and dominated the world in the twentieth. The Faustian bargain it offers—riches and freedoms, at the price of stability, tradition, and community—has proved so attractive that ever more societies keep making it. Now, having left its ideological competitors in the dust, the system is confronting its own flaws, and the reckoning is not always pretty. Yet so far, all the talk about moving on to something new and better remains just that."
9,Agent Running in the Field: A Novel,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2019-12-10/agent-running-field-novel,Agent Running in the Field: A Novel,"For decades, the former MI6 intelligence officer David Cornwell—known to the world by his pseudonym, John le Carré—has written espionage novels starring protagonists who regret, but can never escape, the moral compromises of their often duplicitous profession. His spies have combated the Soviets, criminal networks, and terrorists. Even if they used dubious means, le Carré always seemed to assume that their ends were admirable. He no longer does. At 88, he takes up the timely topic of Brexit through a complex plot involving Russian and Ukrainian oligarchs. The gripping novel’s most sympathetic character considers Brexit a disaster, which he blames on members of the British upper class, whose characterization includes a barely fictionalized portrait of the current prime minister, Boris Johnson, as a naive, self-indulgent, and opportunistic foreign secretary (a post he held from 2016 to 2018). In le Carré’s eyes, his country has not aged well: the years have not added to its wisdom; rather, they have ushered"
10,A Short History of Brexit,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2019-12-10/short-history-brexit,A Short History of Brexit,"For three years now, many observers have tracked the tortured process of Brexit blow by blow, breathlessly waiting for the next headline. As an economic historian and an Irishman, O’Rourke views these events from a dispassionate distance. How, he asks, will Brexit be taught to future generations of university students? He recounts the history of British involvement with Europe over the last 60 years with unique concision and clarity. He searches for the motivations behind the Brexit vote, parsing arguments that it was the inevitable result of structural economic factors, that it stemmed from a misplaced backlash against rising inequality, or that it was just a fluke brought about by political miscalculation and opportunism. Ever the professor, O’Rourke hints that all these views contain some truth. Yet as the facts pile up, it becomes clear that even hard-line Brexiteers recognize that it makes little economic or political sense to eliminate policy coordination with Europe. The heart of the Brexit movement lies not in an economic critique but in a sense of British cultural and historical exceptionalism."
11,Twelve Days That Made Modern Britain,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2019-12-10/twelve-days-made-modern-britain,Twelve Days That Made Modern Britain,"This book romps through 12 transformative moments in the last 40 years of British life, elaborating on the events of a single day for each and its consequences. One can, of course, quibble with some of the choices of important moments. For example, all but one of these seismic days have to do with political or legal developments. Did Hindmoor, a political scientist who generally writes on regulation and public administration, not think to include, for example, the introduction of the commercial Internet in 1992—a more momentous occasion, surely, than the publication of the expenses of members of Parliament in 2008? There are some sloppy lapses in Hindmoor’s research; he gets one of the 12 dates wrong by a year. Nevertheless, the book is strangely entertaining, not least because each chapter summarizes complex events with remarkable clarity, whether describing the terms of the labor union contracts that Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher opposed during the 1984 miners’ strike or the considerations affecting Prime Minister David Cameron’s decision to hold the 2016 Brexit referendum. On a deeper level, Hindmoor forces the reader to ponder the conditional nature of history. Although some changes seem to have been inevitable—the eventual election of a female prime minister or the legalization of gay marriage, for example—others clearly involved knife-edge decisions that could easily have sent events in a different direction."
12,The Outsiders: Refugees in Europe Since 1492,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2019-12-10/outsiders-refugees-europe-1492,The Outsiders: Refugees in Europe Since 1492,"Refugees have played a role in European politics for centuries. Five hundred years ago, most refugees, such as the Puritans who left England for the Netherlands, were fleeing religious persecution. Over the past century and a half, bouts of ethnic cleansing drove Armenians, Bosnians, and many others to seek refuge elsewhere. Since the middle of the twentieth century, many refugees in Europe have been trying to escape the tyranny of fascism, communism, or religious fundamentalism. Ther, a historian, studies how these refugees have been received over the years. The governments and citizens of destination countries tend to oppose the entry of large numbers of refugees during difficult economic times. These countries generally find ways to reject refugees unless a major geopolitical cause is at stake or diaspora communities intercede on their behalf. Even the most proudly humanitarian governments evade international law and manipulate domestic law to avoid their obligations to refugees. Ther remains ambivalent about the policy implications of his work for states today. He recognizes the domestic political challenge of increasing the intake of refugees but insists that the populist right has exaggerated the threat they pose."
13,Metternich: Strategist and Visionary,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2019-12-10/metternich-strategist-and-visionary,Metternich: Strategist and Visionary,"Klemens von Metternich, the Austrian Empire’s foreign minister from 1809 to 1848, has a bad reputation. Even Henry Kissinger, who famously defended the archconservative Austrian as the brilliant architect of 50 years of relative peace in continental Europe in the middle of the nineteenth century, was uneasy about Metternich’s brutal repression of liberal and radical movements for democracy and national self-determination. Thanks in part to Metternich, conservatives rather than liberals would co-opt nationalist ideology, contributing to an aggressive Germany, the conflagration of World War I, and perhaps even the eventual rise of Hitler. With painstaking and pathbreaking primary-source research, this book seeks to redeem Metternich from the criticisms of his detractors. It ultimately fails. Siemann tries to explain Metternich’s uncompromising reactionary views as a sincere response to early trauma suffered when the French Revolution dispossessed his aristocratic family. But portraying Metternich as a victim of trauma, a thoughtful strategist, a harbinger of modern European federalism, and a kindly and moderate man in private doesn’t excuse the cruelty and intolerance of his politics. The book does succeed in forcing readers to wonder whether Metternich’s efforts to defend an essentially conservative order against populists and terrorists are so different from the struggles that liberal democracies face today."
14,Two Books on the American Electorate,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2019-12-10/two-books-american-electorate,Two Books on the American Electorate,"Silva and Lessig both seek to diagnose the troubled American electorate. Silva depicts a landscape of despair in which the social institutions that connect individuals to the “we” around them have largely disappeared. Lessig paints a searing portrait of a defective political system that is nonetheless full of hope, community spirit, self-empowered individuals, and ways to fix what is broken."
15,"The Fifth Domain: Defending Our Country, Our Companies, and Ourselves in the Age of Cyber Threats",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2019-12-10/fifth-domain-defending-our-country-our-companies-and-ourselves,"The Fifth Domain: Defending Our Country, Our Companies, and Ourselves in the Age of Cyber Threats","Armed with digital weapons, hackers, criminals, and nation-states have done incalculable damage to firms, individuals, and governments. For the past two decades, the advantage in cyberspace—which the U.S. military considers a “fifth domain,” alongside those of land, sea, air, and space—has been decisively on the side of offense. In deploying the so-called Stuxnet virus to shut down Iran’s uranium enrichment operation in 2009, Israel and the United States proved that a cyberattack can succeed even if the target is not connected to the Internet. But Clarke and Knake argue that the advantage is now shifting toward defense, even though defending is still far more expensive than attacking. The best approach, they argue, is not to counterpunch when struck but to build resilience into the tools and networks of cyberspace. Doing so won’t prevent attacks but can minimize their damage, so that the assaults that do get through won’t matter much. The authors make digital technology wonderfully clear for nonexperts (their explanation of quantum computing is particularly masterly) and describe dozens of proposed policy fixes to update government’s lagging role. Unfortunately, they don’t adequately deal with the difficulties their proposals would entail or rebut counterarguments that critics might pose."

Yet according to polls, nearly half of nonunion workers (58 million individuals) say they would vote to join a union if they could. The need is obvious: workers’ share of the national income (pay and benefits) is at its lowest level since the 1940s, and average inflation-adjusted hourly pay has been flat since the early 1970s. And public approval of unions is surprisingly high: 62 percent. Unions have a mixed track record, with noble successes and sordid failures. Their future is hard to predict, as they wrestle with whether to reinvent themselves by focusing on broad workers’ rights campaigns, which would benefit many workers who might never join a union, such as the Fight for $15 push to raise minimum wages. Greenhouse blends solid historical research with the intimate knowledge he has gleaned from 20 years of reporting on organized labor to tell an often deeply moving story that has much to say about whether the United States can address the dire inequality that is tearing apart the fabric of American democracy."
17,The Second Founding: How the Civil War and Reconstruction Remade the Constitution,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2019-12-10/second-founding-how-civil-war-and-reconstruction-remade,The Second Founding: How the Civil War and Reconstruction Remade the Constitution,"This book’s thesis is captured in its title: the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments to the U.S. Constitution—which, respectively, abolished slavery, granted birthright citizenship and equal protection under the law, and established voting rights for black (male) Americans—did not just change the text; they created “a fundamentally new document.” Foner has written more than 20 heralded books on the Civil War. This one traces the roller-coaster history of the core acts of Reconstruction from their passage, through the “long retreat” of the Jim Crow decades, to the civil rights legislation of the 1960s, to the Supreme Court’s 2013 rollback of the Voting Rights Act, to the uncertain present. The message is clear: progress is not linear. Rights can be granted, “and they can be taken away”—in this case for an entire century. The book makes constitutional jurisprudence easily accessible to nonlawyers and illuminates the United States’ continuing troubled history of racism. Without shortchanging present-day struggles, Foner’s view of the future is surprisingly hopeful."

The two stories have intertwined over the course of the past 70 years as television transformed, from the unifying monoculture of the three major networks to the fractionalized cable universe. As one TV era followed another, Trump drew personal lessons from each: the talk and lifestyle shows of the 1980s (“all about ego and the projection of self”), the cable news that exploded in the 1990s (“no narrative, no logic, no arc, and no end”), the reality shows that took off in the early years of this century (raw aggression is rewarded, and someone has to lose for someone else to win), and the dark dramas that have won over audiences in recent years (the star is an antihero). As a candidate, he “recognized intuitively what the televised debates were: an elimination-based reality show.” The relationship eventually became symbiotic. He wanted what the camera’s red light wanted: conflict and drama. The book is so rich with insights about the man and the medium that it isn’t until the end that readers will realize it’s still not clear how 60 million Americans could come to see an obviously phony performer as the person they wanted in the Oval Office."
19,The Costs of Conversation: Obstacles to Peace Talks in Wartime,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2019-12-10/costs-conversation-obstacles-peace-talks-wartime,The Costs of Conversation: Obstacles to Peace Talks in Wartime,"In this welcome contribution to the study of wartime diplomacy, Mastro shows why it can be so hard for belligerents to find a diplomatic route out of conflict. Embracing peace talks can signal weakness and a lack of resolve, which can damage the morale of one’s troops while emboldening the adversary. Only those factions confident in their strategic position will agree to open talks, and such offers are often combined with demonstrations of military strength. More circumspect parties to a conflict keep the initial conversations closed. Mastro catalogs many examples of how this dynamic has worked in practice, but her main case studies come from Asia during the Cold War, where she focuses on the experiences of China during the Korean War, China and India during their 1962 war, and the North Vietnamese during the Vietnam War."
20,Only the Dead: The Persistence of War in the Modern Age,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2019-12-10/only-dead-persistence-war-modern-age,Only the Dead: The Persistence of War in the Modern Age,"In the best-selling 2011 book The Better Angels of Our Nature, the psychologist Steven Pinker made the optimistic case that war was on the wane and that human beings had entered the most peaceful period in their species’ history. It was a popular but controversial argument that has since attracted many detractors. Braumoeller delivers a crushing critique by taking on Pinker’s central methodological claim—that his analysis is based on hard data and sound reasoning. As Braumoeller weighs the merits of the evidence supporting Pinker’s thesis, he charts the pitfalls of the various statistical techniques that political scientists commonly use in studying international conflict, showing how to distinguish significant from anomalous findings. The statistical trends that emerge from Braumoeller’s alternative analysis refute the case for optimism. When things do seem to get better, it’s not because humankind is becoming more intrinsically civilized but because the major powers have ordered their affairs in ways that make war less likely."
21,"The Resistance in Western Europe, 1940–1945",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2019-12-10/resistance-western-europe-1940-1945,"The Resistance in Western Europe, 1940–1945","The French historian Wieviorka masterfully analyzes the resistance to the German occupations of Belgium, Denmark, France, Italy, the Netherlands, and Norway during World War II. The results were mixed. For the Allied powers, resistance groups offered invaluable intelligence, as well as escape routes for downed pilots. On the other hand, their sabotage had little economic impact, and anti-Nazi propaganda campaigns helped shape public opinion but did not spark broader insurrections. The Americans and the British faced a tricky task in assisting resistance groups in ways that maximized their value to the war effort but didn’t incite reprisals against vulnerable civilians. Although it presents a broad tableau, the book recognizes the particular circumstances and factors that formed the resistance in each country, including the agendas of governments in exile, bureaucratic squabbles within various groups, and the personal qualities of the brave individuals who accepted the immense risks that came with fighting the Nazis."
22,Betrayal in Berlin: The True Story of the Cold War’s Most Audacious Espionage Operation,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2019-12-10/betrayal-berlin-true-story-cold-wars-most-audacious-espionage,Betrayal in Berlin: The True Story of the Cold War’s Most Audacious Espionage Operation,"For one year spanning 1955 and 1956, British and U.S. intelligence services were able to—literally—tap into top-secret Soviet and East German military communications. Engineers dug a tunnel a quarter of a mile in length from the U.S. zone of divided Berlin to the Soviet zone in order to splice into underground communication wires. Intelligence historians have traditionally claimed that what was called Operation Gold produced no information of value because George Blake, a Soviet mole in British intelligence, warned the KGB about the project before it even began. According to this view, the Soviets would not have allowed conversations of any substance to be intercepted. In this riveting and vivid account of the episode, Vogel demonstrates convincingly that a lot of valuable information was in fact obtained from the tunnel, largely because the KGB wanted to protect Blake from exposure and so decided to maintain the fiction that the Soviets were oblivious to the intrusion. At the heart of the book is Blake’s own remarkable story, which Vogel tells with some sympathy, if not approval. It reads like a Hollywood screenplay: a young Dutchman escapes the Nazis; joins the United Kingdom’s Secret Intelligence Service, or MI6; is captured by North Korean forces during the Korean War; and decides, while in captivity, to become a Soviet agent. In that role, Blake was responsible for many betrayals. Eventually, he was caught, tried, and jailed, before escaping from prison in London and making his way to Moscow—where he still lives on a KGB pension."
23,Call Sign Chaos: Learning to Lead,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2019-12-10/call-sign-chaos-learning-lead,Call Sign Chaos: Learning to Lead,"In this memoir, Mattis does not comment directly on the Trump administration, from which he resigned as secretary of defense in December 2018. But it’s clear from his resignation letter (reproduced in the book) and his persistent stress on the importance of stable, healthy alliances (which are not a feature of U.S. President Donald Trump’s volatile approach to foreign policy) that Mattis didn’t see eye to eye with the president. He is more forthright in his criticism of Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama: the first for being in too much of a rush to invade Iraq and the second for being in too much of a rush to withdraw. Mattis also blames General Tommy Franks for failing to capture Osama bin Laden at Tora Bora, in Afghanistan, in 2001, from where the al Qaeda leader managed to escape to Pakistan. The book’s main concerns, however, are the practical and ethical challenges of military leadership. Mattis draws on his deep professionalism and knowledge of military history in describing the stress of battle and the tough decision to send soldiers into the field to kill and be killed."

Those efforts must continue if we hope to keep the planet hospitable. But it is also time to acknowledge that—no matter what we do—some measure of climate change is here to stay. The phenomenon has already affected the U.S. economy, U.S. national security, and human health. Such costs will only grow over time. The United States must build resilience and overhaul key systems, including those governing infrastructure, the use of climate data, and finance."

Renewable energy has become cheaper, making alternative forms of energy—from the sun, wind, biogas, and other sources—increasingly competitive with fossil fuels. The authors also sketch the ways that people can conserve energy with only modest changes in their behavior and how local leaders and communities can play a big role in making the inevitable transition away from fossil fuels."

In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration must certify the patents for new drugs, a vetting process that began in the early twentieth century to guard against fake medicines. When these patents expire, firms can make generic versions of the same drugs by reverse engineering their active ingredients to produce equivalent medicines without incurring the costs of research, development, and testing. Generic medicines are therefore much more affordable for patients around the world. Eban tells the story of Ranbaxy Laboratories, a now defunct Indian generic drug firm, and its successful but problematic entry into the U.S. market and into other less regulated markets in other countries. She examines the FDA’s spotty procedures for inspecting manufacturing plants outside the United States and the Department of Justice’s fumbling in prosecuting Ranbaxy and its leaders for criminal behavior such as faking compliance with FDA rules. Such illicit activity turns out to be widespread in foreign generic drug firms, especially those in China and India. These firms are skilled at fooling the FDA and other regulatory agencies. Eban’s detailed investigation reveals that government bureaucracies in the United States and abroad are ill equipped for the task of regulating the pharmaceutical industry overseas."
27,Globalization and Health,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2019-12-10/globalization-and-health,Globalization and Health,"This informative book provides a survey of how globalization has enabled the spread of disease and of the concurrent development of global public health practices and institutions. Travelers have spread contagious diseases for centuries. The Republic of Venice introduced the first formal form of quarantine in the fourteenth century during the Black Death. Unsurprisingly, the first period of modern globalization—with the great expansion of trade and travel by steamship in the early twentieth century—coincided with the global influenza pandemic. The predecessor of the World Health Organization was created at this time to track and report outbreaks of threatening diseases. A new phase of globalization has knit the world closer together in the last 30 years, and governments, multilateral institutions such as the who, and international law have concomitantly evolved to better tackle the spread of fatal diseases such as AIDS, Ebola, SARS, and Zika."

It attributes these troubling developments to a decline in competition that has been brought about in large part by the rise of very powerful technology companies and above all by the lack of enforcement of antitrust policies. Philippon also points to the damaging role of politicians who protect the interests of their wealthy donors by sponsoring and creating loopholes in tax and regulatory laws. The book provides a useful comparison with Europe, which suffers from the same ailments but to a lesser degree, and where the European Union and its member states more vigorously enforce policies designed to guarantee competition."

Shaxson angrily decries the overweening influence of banks and investment companies, which he believes lord over the economy to the detriment of other kinds of businesses. He laments how the financial sector absorbs bright college graduates, extracting human capital from the rest of the economy. In the United Kingdom and the United States, all political parties are to blame for the financial sector’s dominance. Shaxson criticizes the former Democratic U.S. president Bill Clinton and the former Labour British prime minister Tony Blair as much as he berates Republicans and Tories. A British journalist, Shaxson reserves particular ire for the City of London—home to the British financial sector—and for the role of British dependencies such as Bermuda in facilitating tax avoidance and many other forms of financial malfeasance. He urges a future post-Trump United States to not only clean up its own act but also pressure the United Kingdom to reckon with the culture of tax avoidance it has created over the years."

In this illuminating history, Kocs traces how international order has risen and fallen over the centuries. At every stage, order emerged from the actions of powerful states that wanted to establish norms, rules, and institutions to suit their own purposes. In each instance, the result was an uneasy balance of coercion and consent, a tension that ultimately became a source of disorder. The victors of World War I set up a new order grounded in universal principles—free trade, self-determination, arbitration, and collective security—but were not willing to extend them to their colonial subjects. During the Cold War, the United States tried to infuse liberal values into its dominance of the Western system, and the Soviet Union tried to justify its rule of the Eastern bloc with a vision of communist egalitarianism. Today’s “liberal order” combines multilateral institutions and the promotion of human rights with forceful diplomacy and military interventionism. Kocs does not break new scholarly ground, but his comparative historical perspective provides a useful primer and a starting point for debate."

In this impressive history, Lorenzini traces the journey of development thinking from its nineteenth-century origins through its entanglements in the great geopolitical struggles of the twentieth century. Development became a front in the ideological battle of the Cold War, as the Soviet Union and the United States competed for hearts and minds in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. Although U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt’s “Four Freedoms” formulation paved the way for a distinctly American approach, the Truman administration played a pivotal role in turning development assistance into a tool of national security and geopolitical competition. Lorenzini argues that although the Soviet Union and the United States articulated their development policies in universal terms, their policies actually served parochial national purposes.

Lawson looks beyond the singular moment to build a more multifaceted understanding of revolutions in this important and sweeping new book, which combines astute theoretical observations and careful historical analysis. He argues that revolutions are not just episodes of political upheaval; they are embedded in deep social change. The Russian Revolution pioneered state-led industrial development. The Vietnamese, Chinese, and Cuban revolutions marked an era of decolonization and the rise of the developing world. The Egyptian revolution of 1952 introduced the model of military-led social transformation and inspired political movements across the Middle East and North Africa. Revolutionary forms of rhetoric and organizational techniques can even be found in movements such as Occupy Wall Street and other radical elements within contemporary Western states. Lawson sets the stage for a new generation of studies of radical social change and the reshaping of the modern global order."
33,World Peace (And How We Can Achieve It),https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2019-12-10/world-peace-and-how-we-can-achieve-it,World Peace (And How We Can Achieve It),"The search for peace is as old as war itself. In this thoughtful account of the “theory and practice of peace,” Bellamy takes aim at the old claim that war is hardwired in human nature, noting that civilizations and societies have existed for long periods in relative peace. He argues that the movement for world peace is not a wide-eyed utopian project but a pragmatic endeavor that builds on a long history of small victories. Although religious and ethnic wars seem to be on the rise, Bellamy is more optimistic about the historical trend away from conflict: the great powers have abstained from war with one another for the longest period in the modern era; the United Nations has established norms and institutions for the peaceful settlement of disputes, peacekeeping, and the protection of civilians; and the use of force for territorial conquest has lost its legitimacy as a tool of statecraft. War will never be abolished, but humans do have the capacity to learn, adapt, and reach for the moral high ground. Bellamy tracks ongoing efforts to create “minor utopias” through pragmatic and incremental steps such as placing legal limitations on the conduct of war, building institutions for conflict mediation, cooperating on peacemaking after war, promoting norms of human dignity and human rights, extending humanitarian aid, and protecting women and children in war zones."
34,Unmerited,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/review-essay/2019-12-10/unmerited,Unmerited,"About 25 years ago, I spent a memorable afternoon in London with Michael Young, the author of the strange 1958 dystopian novel in the form of a dissertation called The Rise of the Meritocracy, which introduced that term into the English language. In the United States, for years, people have liked to insist that wherever they work or go to school is a meritocracy, meaning, roughly, that they understand it as an open competition in which the most deserving succeed. Americans assume meritocracy to be an unalloyed good; the term implies a contrast to some past system or an era when success went instead to lazy inheritors, timeservers, or adept players of office politics."
35,How Poverty Ends,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/world/how-poverty-ends,How Poverty Ends,"For all the worries today about the explosion of inequality in rich countries, the last few decades have been remarkably good for the world’s poor. Between 1980 and 2016, the average income of the bottom 50 percent of earners nearly doubled, as this group captured 12 percent of the growth in global GDP. The number of those living on less than $1.90 a day—the World Bank’s threshold for “extreme poverty”—has dropped by more than half since 1990, from nearly two billion to around 700 million. Never before in human history have so many people been lifted out of poverty so quickly."
36,When Progressives Were on the March,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/review-essay/2019-12-10/when-progressives-were-march,When Progressives Were on the March,"The rise of illiberal politics around the world is generating understandable anxiety over the future of the liberal international order. Most of that concern focuses on the fate of the international institutions that Washington and its allies created after World War II to promote peace and economic openness and to ward off the return of the protectionist, nationalist, and imperialist ideas that had produced so much bloodshed in the first half of the twentieth century. But equally important to the liberal order are the domestic policies and programs that accompanied these international arrangements. These involved a redesign of capitalism, with states balancing markets in order to ensure full (or at least fuller) employment and constructing comprehensive systems of social welfare. Historians have described these changes in various ways: a Keynesian compromise, a social democratic settlement, embedded liberalism. Whatever one calls them, the domestic changes that took place in Western countries after the war were essential for the emergence of the international order, because they made it possible to build and maintain political support for that order."
37,Paths to Power,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/paths-power,Paths to Power,"The world is in an illiberal phase. In recent years, dictators have strengthened their grip on many countries.

In this sweeping account of the rise of the modern world, Acemoglu and Robinson argue that only in rare circumstances have states managed to produce free societies. States have to walk a thin line to achieve liberty, passing through what the authors describe as a “narrow corridor.” To encourage freedom, states must be strong enough to enforce laws and provide public services but also restrained in their actions and checked by a well-organized civil society. The authors call those states that tread this path “Shackled Leviathans,” governments dedicated to upholding the rule of law, protecting the weak against the strong, and creating the conditions for broad-based economic opportunity. Acemoglu and Robinson argue that it was in medieval Europe that states began to find the balance that created the conditions for liberty and economic advancement. They had inherited top-down centralizing institutions from the Roman Empire and bottom-up participatory dynamics from the Germanic tribes that had invaded Rome. Chapters on China, India, the United States, and the Middle East; on the crises of liberal democracy in places such as Weimar Germany; and on modern-day populist movements reinforce the notion that liberty is deeply contingent and often ephemeral."
40,Chained to Globalization,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2019-12-10/chained-globalization,Chained to Globalization,"In 1999, the columnist Thomas Friedman pronounced the Cold War geopolitical system dead. The world, he wrote, had “gone from a system built around walls to a system increasingly built around networks.” As businesses chased efficiency and profits, maneuvering among great powers was falling away. An era of harmony was at hand, in which states’ main worries would be how to manage market forces rather than one another."

With an impeachment inquiry in Washington adding further detail to the story of the Trump administration’s efforts to tie U.S. security assistance for the country to Ukrainian cooperation in investigating President Donald Trump’s Democratic opponents, Trump’s presidency itself hangs in the balance. And the repercussions go even further, raising questions about the legitimacy and sustainability of U.S. power itself."

Observers also suggest that Beijing is helping African states establish the same antidemocratic control over the Internet that it champions at home. Gagliardone’s book provides a more measured account. He does not deny that a number of African governments have upgraded their ability to monitor and limit Internet activity with Chinese assistance. But he reminds readers that Chinese investments have also substantially improved Internet and phone access in many African countries. According to Gagliardone, Beijing has not attached political conditions to these investments and doesn’t privilege regimes that it favors."
43,The Puzzle of Ethiopian Politics,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2019-12-10/puzzle-ethiopian-politics,The Puzzle of Ethiopian Politics,"Lyons’s political history of post–Haile Selassie Ethiopia is timely, as the new prime minister, Abiy Ahmed (who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2019), tries to sustain a beleaguered program of political liberalization. Beginning in the late 1970s, the Tigrayan People’s Liberation Front carried out a disciplined and highly centralized insurgency that toppled the Soviet-backed dictatorship in 1991. Once in power, the TPLF leader Meles Zenawi built a broader, more inclusive party, the Ethiopian People’s Revolutionary Democratic Front, which recognized and sought to incorporate all the ethnic groups in the country, creating a decentralized ethnic federation. Meles led Ethiopia for more than two decades: first as president, from 1991 until 1995, and then as prime minister, until his death in 2012. Lyons does a great job of analyzing how Meles ably managed the fissiparous tendencies of the EPRDF while continuing to make most of the key decisions through a coterie of TPLF leaders and why this balancing act could not outlive him. Ethiopians have welcomed Abiy’s promises to end the Meles regime’s sometimes heavy-handed repression of political rights, but the country is now wrestling with the fragmentary pressures of ethnic politics that Meles managed to contain."
44,Heineken in Africa: A Multinational Unleashed,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2019-12-10/heineken-africa-multinational-unleashed,Heineken in Africa: A Multinational Unleashed,"Heineken, which is brewed in the Netherlands, is one of the most popular and widely available beers in Africa today. That ubiquity masks a darker story. Van Beemen traces the company’s unscrupulous opportunism in establishing a dominant presence in Africa. He catalogs the firm’s objectionable practices, which have included supporting the apartheid regime in South Africa in the 1960s and various authoritarian governments in more recent years and using young women called “promotion girls,” who are often subjected to sexual harassment by clients and even by Heineken staff, to sell the beer. Van Beemen’s revelations caused a scandal in the Netherlands when the book first appeared, but most of his findings were wholly predictable. The book is more interesting when it describes the flexible management practices that allowed the company to function in places such as the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Sierra Leone at times when state authority there was extremely weak. The company’s success also stems from its ability to charge relatively high prices in Africa thanks to the beer’s reputation as a prestige product; since its production costs are low on the continent, Heineken enjoys profit margins in Africa that are higher than elsewhere."
45,Two Books on Islamist Militants in Africa,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2019-12-10/two-books-islamist-militants-africa,Two Books on Islamist Militants in Africa,"Two great books thoughtfully document the persistence of radical Islamist militancy in Africa. Hansen’s is a more conventional political history of the main groups operating in Africa, with chapters devoted to Jamaat Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin in Mali and West Africa, Boko Haram in Nigeria, and al Shabab in Somalia. Much has already been written about these groups, but Hansen’s account has the significant virtue of demonstrating the many individual, organizational, and ideological links among them, which were facilitated by al Qaeda when it was headquartered in the Sudanese capital of Khartoum in the early 1990s. Hansen also emphasizes the great adaptability and resilience of these movements, which have endured in different forms despite concerted attempts to defeat them. One reason for their dogged survival, he suggests, is the groups’ “glocal” nature, their ability to embed themselves in local societies and also follow global trends and dynamics. Groups such as al Shabab or al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb have at times controlled significant stretches of land, but Hansen argues convincingly that they are more effective when they dominate a region politically and levy taxes without maintaining full territorial control."
46,Agents of Disorder: Inside China’s Cultural Revolution,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2019-12-10/agents-disorder-inside-chinas-cultural-revolution,Agents of Disorder: Inside China’s Cultural Revolution,"Scholars seeking to decode the organizing logic of the mass violence that marked China’s Cultural Revolution of the 1960s have long followed the clue provided by the Mao-era slogan “If the father is a hero, the son is a good fellow; if the father is a reactionary, the son is a rotten egg.” They have argued that when the Chinese leader Mao Zedong put out the call to “bombard the headquarters,” people whose families had been labeled “bad elements” rose up to overthrow members of the privileged official class, who then retaliated, giving rise to rounds of conflict based on class status. Walder, however, has devoted decades to examining the local records of nearly all of China’s 2,000-plus county-level jurisdictions. He found that factions emerged from the splintering, rather than the congealing, of class-based groups. Small clusters of students, workers, and cadres struggling to respond to Mao’s shifting directives made split-second decisions about whom to align with. Political identities did not shape the conflict; they emerged from it. To explain this process of identity formation, he offers a theory of “factions as emergent properties” and suggests that similar dynamics may characterize social movements everywhere."
47,When Violence Works: Postconflict Violence and Peace in Indonesia,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2019-12-10/when-violence-works-postconflict-violence-and-peace-indonesia,When Violence Works: Postconflict Violence and Peace in Indonesia,"Several Indonesian provinces demonstrate a problem found in many parts of the world: the persistence of violence even after civil wars and ethnic conflicts come to formal ends. The scale of such incidents varies. After feuding Christians and Muslims agreed to a peace deal in Maluku in 2002, large-scale violent episodes continued to take place. After Indonesian forces finally quashed a separatist rebellion in Aceh in 2005, violence occurred frequently but on a small scale. And in North Maluku, an ethnic conflict that had religious overtones gave way to a period of stability with little violence. When explaining such disparate outcomes, scholars often focus on the effectiveness of reconciliation programs in softening communal hostility. But Barron takes a different approach, one based on his experience working in Indonesia for the World Bank. The key to minimizing the risk of conflict in these situations, he argues, is to ensure that formerly feuding elites have access to sufficient funds and political posts to provide security and stability. The focus on material incentives should be useful for policymakers. But judging from the informative stories that Barron uses to illustrate his analysis, primal hatreds still fuel conflict and do not yield easily to institutional fixes."
48,Two Books on Democracy in Southeast Asia,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2019-12-10/two-books-democracy-southeast-asia,Two Books on Democracy in Southeast Asia,"These two books offer deep insights into political life in Southeast Asia and fresh contributions to the age-old debate over whether true democracy, uncompromised by money and entrenched power, is ever possible. Aspinall and Berenschot dig into the vote-buying processes that have emerged in Indonesia since its transition to democracy in 1998. In older democracies, political parties are institutionalized and have tight control over state resources. But the parties in Indonesia are weak, and politicians can’t rely on the party apparatus; instead, they must mobilize support through informal, freelance “success teams” that are set up by local brokers just for the duration of the campaign. Civil servants often get involved, either as candidates or as brokers, profiting off their social networks and social standing. Successful candidates recoup their expenses using government resources. This system helps incumbents remain in power and opens the way for mining and palm oil interests to collude with officials. Reformist politicians can buck the system in districts where the economy is more diversified. But in most of the country, the system has proved difficult to dislodge."

Since the mid-1990s, the Vietnamese Communist Party has often tolerated and even made concessions to dissenting citizens. The book describes labor protests against working conditions in factories, rural resistance to land seizures, nationalist demonstrations against what some citizens feel has been a weak Vietnamese response to Chinese aggression in the South China Sea, and a small pro-democracy movement that expresses itself mainly on the Internet. The police are likely to intervene if protests go on for too long or grow too large, or if dissenters directly attack the ruling party. But often, the authorities seem to regard protests as helpful, whether in disciplining the foreign owners of factories in Vietnam, rooting out local corruption, signaling displeasure with China, or providing a safety valve for discontent. Kerkvliet suggests that this tolerance for criticism contributes to the regime’s high level of domestic support."
50,Maoism: A Global History,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2019-12-10/maoism-global-history,Maoism: A Global History,"Mao Zedong and Maoism—the ideology of peasant revolution guided by an all-knowing sage—inspired insurgent movements in Cambodia, India, Malaysia, Nepal, Peru, the Philippines, Vietnam, Zimbabwe, and elsewhere. Mao’s thought enjoyed periodic popularity among intellectuals in Western cities, such as Berkeley, Cambridge, Paris, and Rome. Each version of the Maoist creed was principally articulated by middle-class intellectuals who wanted to lead and speak for the suffering masses. Lovell traces this wide-ranging history with a sharp eye for social setting and personality. But it is unlikely that the Mao mystique gave China as much influence over world events as Lovell claims. Mao often served as a symbol for activists who did things their own way, including the Black Panthers in the United States and the Shining Path in Peru. But this sparkling account demonstrates the skill of Chinese propagandists and the pliability and reach of Mao’s image and ideas, even in the years when China was most isolated."

They seek to correct conventional scholarly narratives about secularism and religious identity in two very different countries. Lord examines the idea that the rise of moderate Islamist politics in Turkey—as epitomized by the rule of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his Justice and Development Party, or AKP—reflects the confrontation between a grassroots Muslim society and a monolithic secular state bent on snuffing out religious observance. Instead, Lord argues, the Turkish republican state that came into being after World War I contained significant Islamic elements, clustered in the Directorate of Religious Affairs, known as the Diyanet, and they were granted considerable latitude. Although nominally secular, the Turkish republic embraced de facto Muslim majoritarian rule. Turkish Islamism, Lord suggests, emerged as much from within the state as in opposition to it."

Ottaway and Ottaway bring unrivaled cumulative experience to the analysis of a region they divide into four parts: the “non-states” in the Levant (Iraq, Lebanon, and Syria); an authoritarian Egypt; the bustling emirates of the Gulf (poorly led by Saudi Arabia); and Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia, the three Maghreb states that are drifting away from the Arab world and toward sub-Saharan Africa and Europe. The region’s newly fragmented configuration invites intervention from Iran, Russia, Turkey, and the United States. Curiously, the authors barely mention Israel, which is heavily involved in Lebanon and Syria. The Arab uprisings precipitated the greater entry of Islamic organizations into formal politics. This shift has gone furthest in the Maghreb, where Islamists have participated in elections and in governments. The authors contend that “an antecedent phase of authoritarian state-building” is a prerequisite for any kind of more liberal political opening. Nevertheless, in their analysis, only the countries in the Gulf (not including Saudi Arabia), plus Morocco and Tunisia, are poised to move toward greater democratic freedoms."

The first consists of biographical sketches of four Israeli leaders who all made momentous decisions affecting Israel’s relations with its Arab adversaries: David Ben-Gurion, who announced the birth of Israel in 1948, immediately precipitating a war with its Arab neighbors; Menachem Begin, who promoted unilateral peace with Egypt in 1977, giving up the Sinai Desert in the process; Yitzhak Rabin, who embraced the Oslo peace process; and Ariel Sharon, who unilaterally withdrew from Gaza in 2005. These four leaders were committed to a two-state solution, which Ross and Makovsky emphatically endorse, an outcome that would avoid the creation of a binational state in which a third or more of the population would be Palestinian. In the more intriguing, second part of the book, the authors lay out the arguments for and against the notion that Israel is endangered by an internal Arab demographic “time bomb.” The authors believe that the growth of the Palestinian population is a long-term threat to Israel’s democratic system. They also offer suggestions for what Israel could do unilaterally to move toward a two-state solution—and how Washington could support such actions. The authors should have spent more time on these policy choices and less on the biographies."

In 1980, Iran created the Quds Force, a detachment of the Revolutionary Guards intended to mobilize Shiite communities throughout the Middle East and Central Asia. Uskowi focuses on the Quds Force and Qasem Soleimani, who has led the group since 1998. Although Uskowi has served as a senior U.S. military adviser, his respect for Soleimani is clear. The force’s 200,000 members include Iranians, Afghan Hazaras, Iraqi Shiites, and others. Its budget is largely off the books, siphoned from the operations of Iranian foundations and companies. Annual funding for the group may be as much as $20 billion. Its biggest operation by far is in Syria, but the force is also active in Iraq, through militias that boast 100,000 fighters (twice as many as are in the regular Iraqi military); in Lebanon, through Hezbollah; in Afghanistan, through logistical support for the Taliban; and, since 2014, in Yemen, through the Houthis. In Syria, the Quds Force has established a land bridge from Iran to Lebanon. Despite these gains, Soleimani’s group and its parent body, the Revolutionary Guards, face major obstacles. The risk of a war with Israel is high. Economic decline at home and the fracturing of Shiite communities abroad may also curtail Soleimani’s ambitions."

The United States, in contrast, fills a large chunk of its ambassadorial spots with political appointees—since the 1950s, about a third of the total; under President Donald Trump, up to two-fifths. These outsiders account for some of the greatest highs and lowest lows of U.S. diplomacy, but their world is rarely explored. Bucharest Diary illuminates it well, taking the reader through the journey of a serious, responsible political appointee from start to finish. After some background on his earlier career, Moses traces how he became the U.S. ambassador to Romania in 1994 and what he did there over the next three years. He offers a welcome antidote to the cartoon versions of American foreign policy so prevalent in the popular consciousness, showing exactly what U.S. relations with other countries involve, day to day. In this case, the main issue was how to help a former Eastern-bloc backwater successfully join the West and become a thriving liberal democracy, so the book is also an important firsthand account of how the so-called third wave of democratization played out on the ground. The story is not sexy, but it has the virtue of being true."
56,"Rock, Paper, Scissors",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2019-12-10/rock-paper-scissors,"Rock, Paper, Scissors","This short-story collection portrays small-town Russian life and often feels like a journey back in time. Osipov, a practicing doctor, has been compared to Anton Chekhov, owing not only to their shared vocation but also to the Chekhovian way in which Osipov delves into the lives of ordinary people in dismal circumstances. Many of Osipov’s characters take solace in religion—either Russian Orthodoxy or Islam—or in a misguided celebration of Russia’s renewed militarism. Osipov also invokes an almost visceral love of the Russian landscape. The story “The Gypsy” depicts a doctor from the provinces who supplements his income by escorting sick people from Moscow to the United States. On the plane, he overhears an American steward wondering why “the Russians always stink.” The American doesn’t understand how long it takes travelers just to reach the Moscow airport. The protagonist of the story rejects the idea of moving to the United States, preferring the pungent scent of Russian earth. The collection also reveals the sense of fear and mistrust that has reemerged in Russia over the last two decades. In the final story, members of the Moscow intelligentsia discuss how they would escape from Russia on short notice—without mentioning President Vladimir Putin’s name even once."

In this detailed and comprehensive history, Calic nimbly seeks to broaden the way the region is understood. The book ranges from the advent of Ottoman dominion to the collapse of Yugoslavia. Calic concludes with the NATO bombing of Serbia in 1999, observing that the war, which was waged without a UN mandate, had a “legitimacy problem”—and that this compelled Western governments to spin the intervention with a “clever propaganda strategy.” Although sympathetic to the work of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (for which she worked), she does not discuss the difficulty it had in achieving recognition and support in the most relevant places of all: in the lands of the former Yugoslavia. The substance of the book criticizes stereotypes about the region, and yet the title references an unpleasant Western cartoon from the period of the Balkan Wars (1912–13), thus somewhat undercutting Calic’s effort to rethink conventional accounts."

As related by Gilburd’s rich history of the Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev’s cultural opening to the West, the festival brought about two weeks of unceasing communal elation, as young Soviet men and women passionately bonded with peers from all over the world: wandering about Moscow, dancing, singing, forging friendships, making love. Unlike earlier attempts at westernization, the one initiated by Khrushchev’s “thaw” reached beyond Soviet elites to include the masses. French pop music played on the radio, Italian films appeared in movie theaters, and the “domesticating” approach to literary translation made Western novels part of Soviet culture—and even Soviet life. But as this stream of Western culture flowed into the Soviet Union, the state’s borders remained closed, and foreign travel, heavily restricted. The Soviet people became infatuated with a mythical West. Later, many experienced the reality of the West firsthand either as immigrants or when post-Soviet Russia sought to more fully embrace Western ways and norms—and then they came to believe they had been wronged. What they felt was more than disillusionment, Gilburd writes: it was dispossession."

Halperin describes Ivan as “the first ruler of Muscovy”—it would be ahistorical, he notes, to use “Russia” when writing about the sixteenth century—“to employ mass terror as a political instrument,” a practice that vanished until Joseph Stalin revived it three and a half centuries later. Yet in his meticulous book, Halperin cautions historians against reducing Ivan’s contradictory personality to that of a mere sadistic tyrant. Halperin does not share the common view that the gratuitous savageries of the oprichnina made it worse than the violence in western Europe brought about by religious strife, class warfare, or ethnic bigotry during the same time period. In a contrarian spirit, he insists that Ivan’s actions do not distinguish him from other monarchs from that era, such as Henry VIII of England and Philip II of Spain. To account for the oprichnina, Halperin focuses on Ivan’s interaction with a Muscovite society overstrained by an “unprecedented and intolerable level of elite and popular social mobility.” Ivan’s introduction of repressive meas-ures exacerbated the preexisting social instability before spiraling into mass terror and executions."

In researching grand projects in Soviet Tajikistan, such as the construction of the Nurek Dam, Kalinovsky discovered that leaders grew more careful in order to avoid the disastrous consequences of Stalin’s ruthless industrialization. They repeatedly revised their plans, as well, when they learned that their presumptions were wrong: for instance, when they realized that Central Asian peasants were not anxious to move to cities. Kalinovsky’s illuminating book puts special emphasis on the ironies, contradictions, and tensions involved in Soviet modernization. Despite the communist state’s staunch anticolonialism and anti-imperialism, its policies in Central Asia acquired an unmistakable imperial quality. One example was the attempt to bring kulturnost to far-flung territories by introducing “civilized” behavioral norms and European art forms. As the Soviet Union collapsed, the Soviet-educated intelligentsia of the newly independent Central Asian states complained about the loss of their culture: a classic postcolonial grievance."
61,How to Fix American Health Care,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2019-12-10/how-fix-american-health-care,How to Fix American Health Care,"There are many statistics that illustrate the flaws of the U.S. health-care system. One in particular stands out. In 2017, Americans spent an average of $10,224 per person on health care, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation study. The equivalent figure across similarly wealthy countries that year was just $5,280. Yet despite spending almost twice as much as Australians, Canadians, Japanese, and many Europeans, Americans suffer from lower life expectancy, higher infant mortality rates, and a higher prevalence of heart disease, lung disease, and sexually transmitted infections."
62,Forgotten Bastards of the Eastern Front: American Airmen Behind the Soviet Lines and the Collapse of the Grand Alliance,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2019-12-10/forgotten-bastards-eastern-front-american-airmen-behind-soviet,Forgotten Bastards of the Eastern Front: American Airmen Behind the Soviet Lines and the Collapse of the Grand Alliance,"In early 1944, the United States established a number of air bases in Soviet Ukraine. Their fate mirrored that of the uneasy U.S.-Soviet alliance, which was initially sustained by a common enemy but quickly unraveled after World War II ended. Plokhy’s unique account of this well-known episode benefits from the recent opening of Ukrainian archives containing KGB documents detailing the Soviet surveillance of the Americans at the bases. The American and Soviet servicemen eagerly cooperated but were struck by their cultural differences. The Soviets thought that the Americans were wasteful (they used spare parts instead of repairing broken ones) and lacked commitment (they broke for lunch before their work was finished). The Americans were surprised by the great number of Soviet women doing “men’s jobs” and by Soviet farmers’ reliance on hoes instead of tractors. Warm relations soon chilled as the Soviets recruited civilians and servicemen to spy on the Americans and roughly interfered in the Americans’ dating of local women. Meanwhile, leaders in Moscow and Washington grew increasingly suspicious of each other, and by the time the last air base was closed, in May 1945, the allies had become rivals."

In Inner Mongolia, he finds a community of “Chinese Russians” who use Russian names and look “European” yet speak standard local Chinese, their Russianness serving mostly as an attraction for Chinese tourists. He finds himself in an obscure Russian settlement where North Korea’s founding dictator, Kim Il Sung, spent four years in the 1940s and where his son Kim Jong Il was born—although neither of those facts is recognized in North Korea’s official histories. Over the centuries, Pulford writes, Russia has played many roles in the Chinese consciousness: “from imperial adversary to Soviet inspiration, anti-Japanese liberator, socialist blood-brother, ‘revisionist’ enemy, post-Soviet trade partner and, most recently, authoritarian ‘friend.’” But despite the duration and diversity of the two societies’ interactions, human bonds and cross-cultural influences remain amazingly scarce: intermarriage is rare, work and business ethics differ greatly—and Russian food, as Pulford’s interlocutors repeatedly tell him, tastes terrible to the Chinese."
64,Sounds of Vacation: Political Economies of Caribbean Tourism,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2019-12-10/sounds-vacation-political-economies-caribbean-tourism,Sounds of Vacation: Political Economies of Caribbean Tourism,"In this innovative but uneven collection of essays, anthropologists and ethnomusicologists explore the sounds and music of the all-inclusive resorts (hotels offering prepaid vacation packages that include lodging, meals, and entertainment) that are booming all over the Caribbean. The scholars borrow from critical theory—including a Marxist focus on the alienation of labor and postmodern pessimism—with some going so far as to compare the resorts to slave plantations. None of the contributors brings a business background to the study of what are, after all, commercial enterprises. In their ethnographic interviews of resort managers and musicians, some of the contributors discover that studious deliberations go into choosing the melodies, tempos, sequencing, volume, and placement of songs in public areas, with attention paid to carefully balancing familiar tunes with the discovery of new sounds; such “soundscape curation” furthers the resorts’ commercial goal of pleasing the guests. Many of the musicians are well-traveled cosmopolitans capable of creatively blending global knowledge with pride in their local legacies."
65,May You Live in Interesting Times,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2019-12-10/may-you-live-interesting-times,May You Live in Interesting Times,"At the 58th edition of the contemporary art world’s most prominent international event, Latin American and Caribbean countries hosted 13 of the 87 national pavilions. Ministries of culture or foreign affairs, often in collaboration with national experts, selected local artists for the high honor of showcasing their creative works in Venice. Among the Latin American offerings, Swinguerra, a Brazilian video installation, dazzled with exuberant Afro-Brazilian dancers proudly asserting their complex identities, including some who identified as nonbinary. Other Latin American artists presented much darker visions. In the Argentine pavilion, Mariana Telleria erected a parade of large, ominous creatures gathered in what her curator described as a “dystopian cultural landscape.” In the Peruvian pavilion, Christian Bendayán critically explored the way Europeans eroticized the Amazonian jungle and its populations. In the Chilean pavilion, Voluspa Jarpa reduced Latin American history to a series of degrading impositions by “hegemonic” powers. In sharp contrast to these offerings from South America, the art in the pavilions of China and the United States—today’s preeminent powers—while not ignoring the contradictions of the human condition, reveled in those countries’ respective national achievements."
66,Religion and Brazilian Democracy: Mobilizing the People of God,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2019-12-10/religion-and-brazilian-democracy-mobilizing-people-god,Religion and Brazilian Democracy: Mobilizing the People of God,"Jair Bolsonaro won the 2018 Brazilian presidential election with the decisive support of evangelical Christian voters. In the last 30 years, the number of evangelicals in Brazil has more than doubled, largely at the expense of Catholics. As in the United States, in Brazil, the entrance of evangelical clergy into electoral politics has bolstered right-wing political movements. In her timely, data-rich study, Smith attributes the reactionary backlash in Brazil and elsewhere in Latin America to the emergence of issues that trigger fear among evangelicals: gay and transgender rights, sex and gender education in public schools, and abortion. In Smith’s view, the ultimate impact of the rise of evangelicals remains to be seen. On the one hand, an intolerant dualism—dividing the world into sinners and the faithful—would threaten democratic norms. On the other hand, Smith suggests a more hopeful outcome if clergy and their congregants enter electoral politics and have their beliefs moderated by involvement in democratic practices. In Smith’s surveys, clergy expressed strong support for democracy “as the best form of government.”"
67,The Confounding Island: Jamaica and the Postcolonial Predicament,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2019-12-10/confounding-island-jamaica-and-postcolonial-predicament,The Confounding Island: Jamaica and the Postcolonial Predicament,"Patterson explores the paradoxes of his native Jamaica in a series of stimulating essays. A historical sociologist, he burnishes his command of the scholarly literature on Jamaica by drawing from his experiences on the island as a young man and, later on, as a policy adviser. Patterson attributes neighboring Barbados’s superior economic performance to its faithful adaptation, in form and practice, of British governing institutions; in contrast, Patterson blasts Jamaica’s post-independence elites for their divisive politics, corruption, incompetence in business, and wasteful luxury consumption. Patterson is an institutionalist interested in how to create effective bureaucracies and leadership, a focus evident in how he appraises Jamaica’s excellence in track and field, for example. The sporting tradition that brought the world the sprinter Usain Bolt stems not from genetic factors but from good public health, strong athletic programs, and revered role models. Patterson locates the roots of the island’s high crime rates in the historical brutality of slavery, the country’s poverty, and gangland battles for political patronage. The book concludes on a hopeful note, sketching a rising generation of more capable democratic politicians and business executives."
68,Two Books on Globalization,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2019-12-10/two-books-globalization,Two Books on Globalization,"Toro Hardy, a retired senior Venezuelan diplomat and a prolific author, surveys the critical literature on globalization from a center-left Latin American perspective. He accepts globalization as a given and recites a familiar litany of “neoliberal” sins: market fundamentalism, austerity, inequality. Nor, however, is Toro Hardy enamored of populists who “are obsessed with the wrong issues and bygone eras.” Rather, he reserves his more optimistic, and provocative, commentary for the upcoming technological disruptions of the so-called Fourth Industrial Revolution, where he sees dangers but also opportunities for Latin America. Technologies such as 3-D printing will “decouple” South America from the industrialized nations, reducing commercial exchanges between the North and the South. Meanwhile, Mexico and the Caribbean basin could benefit from an expansion of supply chains within the region. Massive urbanization in China and India will help generate further growth in the region by increasing demand for resource-based commodities. Toro Hardy urges Latin America to cooperatively pool its resources, assisting “high-tech artisans” in reindustrializing the region on its own terms."
69,Ever-Further Union,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/review-essay/2019-12-10/ever-further-union,Ever-Further Union,"The European Union may well be the most ambitious and successful experiment in voluntary international cooperation in history. It has lasted longer than most national democracies in the world today. But it is deadly dull. So it is no surprise that novelists shun EU politics. How could a writer possibly find inspiration among the soulless steel and glass buildings of Brussels, where pedantic bureaucrats, politically correct diplomats, and remorseless lobbyists hammer out market regulations?"

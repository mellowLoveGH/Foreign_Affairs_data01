2,War No More,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/war-no-more,War No More,"As Steven Pinker observes, we recall the twentieth century as an age of unparalleled violence, and we characterize our own epoch as one of terror. But what if our historical moment is in fact defined not by mass killing but by the greatest levels of peace and safety ever attained by human­kind? By way of this provocative hypothesis, the acclaimed psychologist and cognitive neuroscientist aims to liberate us from the overblown victimhood-by-contiguity of the present moment, maintaining quite credibly that we ought to be grateful for living when we do."
3,South Africa Pushed to the Limit: The Political Economy of Change,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2012-01-01/south-africa-pushed-limit-political-economy-change,South Africa Pushed to the Limit: The Political Economy of Change,"This book, by one of South Africa’s most prominent progressive journalists, is a thought-provoking analysis of the weaknesses and failures of the country’s leadership since the end of apartheid. After reviewing the ruling African National Congress’ record on economic policymaking, HIV/AIDS, education, and antipoverty measures, the book examines the country’s coalition politics and details the ascent of President Jacob Zuma in recent years. Not everyone will agree with Marais’ assessment that governance has suffered from the excessive influence of corporate capital. Although he concedes that policymakers have succeeded in some areas, Marais argues that barring an unlikely radical break with the tradition of corporate power, the government’s initiatives are doomed to have a limited effect on economic growth and people’s welfare. Perhaps as a result, the book offers few prescriptive solutions to the policy failures it identifies with passion and at great length.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."
4,Making War in Côte d’Ivoire,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2012-01-01/making-war-cote-divoire,Making War in Côte d’Ivoire,"Under the leadership of President Félix Houphouët-Boigny, who managed Côte d’Ivoire’s transition to independence, the country was perceived as one of West Africa’s few success stories, at least until the late 1980s. Domestic political stability and close relations with France aided steady growth in the economy, which was based on agricultural exports, most notably cocoa. By the time Houphouët-Boigny died, in 1993, the Ivoirian miracle had already been seriously tarnished after a collapse in cocoa prices. But few predicted the country’s descent into ethnic polarization and civil conflict. McGovern demonstrates how ethnic identities became entrenched over the decades, as a result of the mass migration of northerners encouraged by the government to find work in southern cocoa-producing regions. When the economy stalled in the 1990s, politicians such as Laurent Gbagbo took advantage of the resentments generated by conflicts over land and social inequalities. McGovern skillfully unmasks the financial interests at stake in the country’s politics: the cocoa sector continues to generate substantial revenues, which the state elite controls through an opaque web of public and semipublic organizations.

Although Botswana and Zambia make occasional appearances, Chan focuses on South Africa and Zimbabwe and emphasizes the many links between them, from the attempts by former South African President Thabo Mbeki and the current president, Jacob Zuma, to broker a peace deal in their northern neighbor to the three million or so Zimbabwean refugees currently living in South Africa. Chan, a longtime observer of African politics, considers how the shared worldviews of such leaders as Mbeki and Zimbabwe’s autocrat, Robert Mugabe, stem from their similar educations and experiences in the long anticolonial struggle. Chan is fascinated by the personal foibles of the region’s long-standing leaders and has an eye for telling details, such as Mbeki asking whether he needs to wear “ridiculous shirts” like Nelson Mandela in order to enjoy the former leader’s levels of popularity and the $65,000 wristwatch worn by the governor of the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe, even as the country’s currency disintegrated.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

Eichstaedt’s book focuses on the conflicts in the eastern DRC in 2006–9. Through interviews with soldiers, politicians, and businesspeople, along with ordinary people, the book explores the role that resources such as gold and coltan played in fueling the conflict. One particularly fascinating chapter narrates a decadelong struggle between rival warlords and their foreign backers, including the Ugandan government, to control a lucrative gold mine. Coltan, a mineral widely used in advanced electronics, such as cell phones, has emerged as a convenient symbol of the West’s complicity in the wars in the DRC. Eichstaedt diligently traces the supply chain, from primitive mines in the forest to the subsidiaries of major Western corporations. But he notes that probably less than ten percent of the world’s coltan comes from the DRC and reports that many companies have responded to the negative publicity by adopting voluntary codes of practice that aim to mitigate the worst abuses associated with coltan mining."
7,Deng Xiaoping and the Transformation of China,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2012-01-01/deng-xiaoping-and-transformation-china,Deng Xiaoping and the Transformation of China,"China scholars might think they have read enough about Deng Xiaoping. After all, at least three biographies of Deng were available prior to the release of this massive new book. But Vogel, one of the world’s preeminent Asia scholars, has produced the most comprehensive and authoritative account of Deng’s career as a revolutionary, party leader, and architect of China’s reform. Meticulously researched and highly readable, the book is not a typical biography. It does not dwell much on Deng’s personal life. Instead, the focus of the book is Deng’s unusual career trajectory, his unique style of rule, and the strategic choices he made during and after the Cultural Revolution. Vogel considers the extent to which Deng fundamentally and irreversibly transformed China’s society, governance, and relations with the outside world. In Vogel’s view, “no other leader in the twentieth century” did more to improve the lives of more people or had such a large and lasting influence on world history. Although he believes that Deng’s overall role in history has been underestimated, Vogel argues convincingly that Mao Zedong’s handpicked successor, Hua Guofeng -- and not Deng -- was the true harbinger of China’s reform and opening. The book could have paid more attention to the downsides of the changes Deng wrought, such as omnipresent corruption and a rapid decline in social morality. Nevertheless, this book should be read by anyone who wants to understand the domestic and international dynamics that have led to China’s rise as a great power.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

Liu’s critical essays and moving prison poetry combine to form a fascinating portrait of China during a period of rapid development and political change. If there was ever any doubt that Liu deserved the Peace Prize, this book erases it."

The central government, fearing political instability, responded recently with an updated labor-contract law and pension reforms. Perversely, however, those measures have actually intensified the incentives for enterprises to avoid long-term labor commitments, entrenching what one contributor to this insightful volume calls a state of “permanent temporariness.” Worker pushback has taken the form of petty sabotage, work slowdowns, demonstrations, strikes, and fragile efforts to organize independent labor organizations. As a whole, this collection suggests that if China cannot balance the need for flexibility in the job market with the demand for social justice, it will be hard for the country to continue its rapid economic growth while maintaining political stability.

10,Human Rights in Asia,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2012-01-01/human-rights-asia,Human Rights in Asia,"Asian governments no longer reject the universality of human rights in principle, as some did as recently as the 1990s. Instead, they seek to interpret those norms in ways that are consistent with priorities such as political stability and interethnic harmony. Many governments have adopted new laws and established human rights commissions or other national human rights institutions. But these have been powerless to prevent such abuses as the revival of extrajudicial killings in the Philippines under former President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo and the unchecked use of violence by the police during the war on drugs in Thailand under former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra. Governments throughout the region continue to justify repression with a mix of culturalist and security arguments. None­theless, the group of mostly Australia-based contributors to this book believe that pressure from local civil-society groups and transnational advocacy networks are gradually strengthening the force of the human rights idea in the region.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

China seeks to ban weapons in outer space but meanwhile has developed antisatellite and manned space flight capabilities. Japan has long had the region’s most sophisticated space program for peaceful purposes, but in 2008, the Japanese parliament lifted a ban on the use of space for defense. India’s space program has also adopted a more militaristic orientation, building satellites for reconnaissance, intelligence, and navigation, with potential applications for missile defense. South Korea’s space program is a latecomer, developed largely in cooperation with other states and spurred in part by the need for surveillance of North Korea’s missile activity. Smaller space programs exist in nearly a dozen other nations in the region, making Asia a new epicenter of space activity. Moltz deftly melds technological expertise with history and political analysis. He warns that the region’s competitive dynamic is bringing military applications to the fore instead of peaceful activities such as geographic sensing, weather forecasting, and telecommunications.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."
12,Chinese Religious Life,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2012-01-01/chinese-religious-life,Chinese Religious Life,"Religious life is flourishing in China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. People practice various forms of Buddhism, Christianity, Confucianism, Islam, Taoism and even Bahaism, Mormonism, and Russian Orthodoxy -- sometimes in combination with one another and alongside folk religions and homegrown faiths such as Falun Gong. The religious revival is driven by a hunger for moral meaning arising from rapid social change and the decay of official ideology. This lucid, accessible survey by a collection of academic experts describes the religious practices of the new urban middle class, the Buddhist revival in Taiwan, religious philanthropy, and a host of other topics. In the villages, everyday life is infused with a mix of feng shui, ancestor veneration, worship of local deities, propitiation of ghosts, and divination. In the cities, people evince a growing sense of religious individualism, maintaining, as one informant puts it, that “what I believe is nobody’s business but my own.” Religious activity helps mend the tattered fabric of social trust, and in that way, it contributes to the government’s goal of social harmony. But it also challenges the state’s policy of constraining religious practice, creating the threat of independent social action. Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

When it comes to the medium term, he is judiciously nonalarmist, arguing that dialogue will trump confrontation over economic issues and that China will not displace the United States as the dominant military power in the western Pacific in the foreseeable future. He also reports the views of more than 50 current and former U.S. officials on what ails the Asia policy process. The problems include bureaucratic rivalries (especially between the State Department and the Pentagon) and the failure of the National Security Council to perform its coordinating function. The White House views Congress as disruptive, and Congress suspects the White House of manipulation and deception. Still, Swaine maintains that the United States’ China policy has essentially been on the right track and should continue to be defined by a combination of cooperative engagement and hedging. Over the long term, however, the United States must do a better job of managing its problems at home, or, Swaine says, it might be forced into a cooperative security arrangement with China in the Asia-Pacific region.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

If so, has it become troubled? Those questions are addressed in this useful volume by experts on the foreign policies of the three countries and the domestic politics that shape those foreign policies. A number of interpretations emerge. The triangle was never equilateral. Washington “provided the incentive and the glue” that held it together. The Israeli-Turkish “alliance” is troubled, but neither side seeks a complete break. The pro-Israel commentariat in the United States has shifted from supporting to attacking Turkey. Changes in Turkish foreign policy are better understood as a response to post–Cold War realities than as resulting from the rise of the Justice and Development Party (AKP), the party with Islamist roots that has been in power since 2002. The AKP’s leaders believe the United States “went to war in Iraq to create a Kurdish state and divide Turkey.” Iranians (the subject of a separate chapter) continue to believe that the “ultimate interest of the United States is regime change.” Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

Rather than highlighting the Balkan Wars, Gallipoli, the Arab revolt, and “the twice-promised land,” Reynolds moves eastward to concentrate on the clash between those two old enemy empires, the Russians and the Ottomans, both destined to die by the decade’s end. Their disputed border cut through a “belt of mixed population,” home to Christians and Muslims: Armenians, Azerbaijanis, Circassians, Georgians, Kurds, and others. In this region, Reynolds argues persuasively, both empires were guided more by raison d’état than by religious solidarity or nationalism. That fact led to wartime ironies (the Ottomans pushing the Transcaucasians to assert an independence about which the Transcaucasians were dubious) and turned multiple groups into the victims of tragic massacres (most of all the Armenians, but the Kurds and others as well). With a fine objectivity, Reynolds draws on both Ottoman and Russian sources and reveals how the actions and attitudes of the two declining empires shaped the post-imperial paths of Turkey and the Soviet Union.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."
16,The Crimean War: A History,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2012-01-01/crimean-war-history,The Crimean War: A History,"Drawing on military analysis and diplomatic history alike, this lengthy book details the three years of 1853–56, when war pitted France, the Ottomans, and the United Kingdom against Russia, and also offers a history of the decades leading up to and following the war. Figes introduces into his story not only leaders but also people of all classes; his settings are not only capitals but also far-flung territories. The four empires get equal attention, and he shows the impact of a changing domestic situation in each -- changes ­catalyzed, in some cases, by the spread of the telegraph and the advent of “unembedded” foreign reporting by journalists such as the London Times war correspondent William Russell. Florence Nightingale gets her due, and so, too, does Russia’s Nikolai Pirogov, “the first surgeon to employ anesthesia in a field operation.” Figes emphasizes the powerful role of religion in predisposing the parties to conflict, but it was more Orthodox versus Catholic than Christian versus Muslim. This elaborate mosaic of contending leaders, armies, peoples, and ideologies is the most comprehensive history available of the Crimean War.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

Under all three, Egypt remained a military regime that, despite early signs of dynamism, soon slipped into a sluggish and brutal authoritarianism. Cook stresses the Egyptian fear of domination by outsiders, rooted in a long history of foreign occupations, and reveals the smoldering Egyptian resentment of the United States, which in the 1970s replaced the Soviets as Egypt’s great-power patron. His final chapter tells of the 18 days of upheaval that ended Mubarak’s rule -- a popular revolt, but one whose coup de grâce was delivered by the military. Cook concludes that although Egypt’s future remains very much in doubt, the United States should “take a hands-off approach as Egyptians build a new political system on their own terms.”Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

After opening with the U.S. action against Afghanistan after 9/11, the story treats the early years of the U.S. invasion of Iraq before moving on to Europe in mid-decade (in the chapter “Bombs, Riots, and Cartoons”) and Iraq during the “surge.” In what is perhaps the strongest portion of the book, Burke returns to Afghanistan and adds Pakistan to the narrative, which culminates in the dispatching of Osama bin Laden in May 2011. Throughout, Burke reconstructs and judges what the different protagonists, especially the United States and al Qaeda, were thinking and doing. He argues convincingly that the political realities of the post-9/11 era are best captured not by focusing on would-be centers of global terrorism but by examining the different circumstances of communities within the wider Muslim world, including Muslims living in the West.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

With this book, Raleigh has done his part to correct this neglect, by conducting interviews with 60 members of the 1967 graduating classes of two elite high schools, one in Moscow and one in Saratov, a southern city. What emerges is an oral history of their generation, the Soviet Union’s version of the baby boomers. They are the children of professionals and midlevel authorities, and they remember their childhoods and school days fondly and with some pride. They grew up without the kind of suffering that their parents had known as young people. Reaching adulthood during the Brezhnev era, they jostled against the regime’s strictures in minor ways by aping Western fads. As the Soviet system deteriorated, they married and divorced and struggled with careers, all the while developing a vague, unfocused cynicism. This book is a collective biography that will fascinate its subjects’ grandchildren, to whom the world it depicts will seem like a distant planet.

Much less is known about how the terror was experienced by ordinary people -- especially the roles played by the victims’ desperate friends, families, neighbors, and co-workers. Goldman fills that gap by reconstructing the actions of workers in five major factories between 1936 and 1938, the most intense phase of the purges, as revealed in the stenographic records of Communist Party workplace meetings. The book is an excruciating account of how victims (and potential victims) enlarged and sped the killing machine: workers denouncing workers, family members betraying family members, and lovers sacrificing lovers in vain attempts to save themselves, as Stalin and his lieutenants ordered each new wave of purges.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

Braithwaite was the British ambassador to the Soviet Union during the last two years of the war and the first two years of its messy aftermath. Like a film director zooming in on details and then pulling away to survey the larger scene, he captures the misery of war in Afghan villages and valleys, along with the confused deliberations in the halls of the Kremlin, while not losing sight of the war’s effect on Soviet society, especially the badly damaged military. Afgantsy is the Russian term for the Soviet soldiers who fought the war, and Braithwaite recounts many of their individual stories with special empathy.

Differing accounts put more or less weight on the role of policies, geography, culture, history, and international interventions. Only by answering this question can one decide how best to reduce poverty in low-income countries. Yet few debates about public policy are more contentious. More than half a century of intensive efforts to improve the lot of the poor in the developing world has had mixed success. Although some countries, such as China, have made enormous progress in reducing poverty, many others have languished. Today, most estimates suggest that more than one billion people live on less than $1.25 per day."

If war guilt is to be assigned, this book argues, it should go not only (or even primarily) to Germany -- the long-accepted culprit -- but also to Russia. In the conventional view, Russia was trapped into fatal military moves by Austria’s blundering and Germany’s predatory aims. But McMeekin contends that Russians close to the tsar had long hungered to strip control of the Black Sea straits from a collapsing Ottoman Empire. McMeekin places the blame squarely on Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Sazonov, and a coterie of military officials who were willing to watch the 1914 Balkan crisis spiral into general war, as long as France and the United Kingdom were ready to checkmate Germany and allowed Russia to pursue its ambitions. As Europe’s map shattered, the Russians might have been motivated by apprehension over who would get what. But their actions were bald and aggressive, as McMeekin demonstrates through a bold reading between the lines of history.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

Both qualities are on full display in this latest of his many books. Russia, he argues, has moved beyond the analytic clichés of Western observers. No longer do its leaders or people suffer from the phantom pain of a lost empire or harbor dreams of restoring what they lost. Russia’s dilemma is post-imperial: how to keep a sprawling, unwieldy, half-remade country intact, when the only popularly tolerated solution -- quasi-authoritarianism -- risks marginalizing the country and leaving it squeezed between two more powerful and dynamic continents, Europe and Asia. With a measured mastery, Trenin probes the many aspects of this dilemma, from Russia’s changing relations with its neighbors and the great powers to the effect of the country’s identity crisis on its economy, demographics, and culture.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

In this poignant memoir, Ramírez extols the idealism of the youthful Sandinistas, too many of whom fell as martyrs in their bloody battles against the tyrannical Somoza dynasty. At the same time, he recognizes the many errors the inexperienced revolutionaries committed once in power. Ramírez paints vivid portraits of those Latin American leaders who assisted the Sandinistas. As he so often does, Fidel Castro emerges as a master realist; the Panamanian strongman Omar Torrijos, it is shown, took his fill of liquor and women yet functioned as a savvy strategist. Ultimately marginalized by internal Sandinista intrigues, Ramírez disdains the new materialism of his putatively socialist ex-comrades (the “muchachos”). In yet another twist of history, the Nicaraguans recently reelected Ortega, in part because he has built a working relationship with the private sector, cemented by common interests in a growing economy. More pragmatic now, Ortega has raised the living standards of the Nicaraguan poor by drawing on funding from both the World Bank and the oil-rich Venezuela of Hugo Chávez.

But patient readers will be rewarded by his frequent insights, stimulating historical comparisons, and command of the data relating to Cuba’s economic and social performance. Many have faulted Cuba’s Stalinist bureaucratic centralization, but few critiques are as replete with concrete examples of foolishness and foul-ups. Farber harshly criticizes Cuba’s treatment of blacks, homosexuals, and political dissidents and exposes the Castro regime’s practice of obfuscating policy debates through character assassination. But he takes seriously Raúl Castro’s economic reform agenda, seeing it as a variant of the Sino-Vietnamese model of state capitalism combined with political authoritarianism. The big winners, Farber speculates, could be senior officials of the Cuban military and the Communist Party, the foundations of a new managerial and technocratic class that could conceivably form an alliance with the more moderate wing of Cuban American capitalists based in Florida.

Liberal democracy, besieged on the left by Stalin's Soviet Union and on the right by Hitler's Germany and Mussolini's Italy, seemed to stand no chance of survival. Most central and eastern European countries had already succumbed to ­authoritarianism or different variations of fascism, and the Great Depression suggested that the activist solutions implemented by both extremes were better than the feeble nostrums liberalism could offer. Back then, the notion that by the beginning of the twenty-first century, Europe would be democratic from the Tagus and the Ebro to the Danube and the Vistula would have seemed utterly ridiculous."

In terse but devastating prose, he discusses the difficulties of transplanting Soviet-style planning into a underdeveloped economy in the tropics, making it dramatically evident that at least some members of the top Cuban leadership are well aware of the country’s economic shortcomings. Rodríguez recounts various cycles of tepid reform but fails to elucidate why those reforms were not pursued with greater vigor. Evincing some frustration, he asserts that questions of power and politics regularly took precedence over economics. Since coming to power in 2006, Raúl Castro has begun yet another round of economic reforms. Unlike previous attempts, these reforms appear to be gaining momentum. During Rodríguez’s years in power, the international community failed to support Cuban reformers. Now, it has an opportunity to do better.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."
30,Fixing Haiti: MINUSTAH and Beyond,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2012-01-01/fixing-haiti-minustah-and-beyond,Fixing Haiti: MINUSTAH and Beyond,"Demonstrably unable to govern itself, Haiti is now a permanent de facto international trusteeship, depending on the United Nations for its security and international donors for its economy. The United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH) is more vigorous than previous international efforts to assist the Haitians. It includes substantial numbers of Argentines, Brazilians, and Chileans, marking a new phase of regional self-assertiveness and collective responsibility. The authors in this volume oscillate between recognizing the urgency of a large international role in a fragile or failed state and arguing that local ownership and national institution building are required for lasting change. Two Chilean military commanders attached to MINUSTAH provide an unusually candid account of the challenges facing international peacekeepers in a lawless, distrustful society. In contrast, a Brazilian diplomat takes snide swipes at the United States and nongovernmental organizations, inadvertently raising doubts about whether Brazil is genuinely prepared to play a constructive leadership role. The editors’ concluding chapter neatly sums up the many dilemmas facing nation building in Haiti, conceding an absence of civic-mindedness and social capital among Haitians but nevertheless advocating a long-term international commitment.

Tocci disagrees and argues that the United States exercises a significant hidden influence over EU-Turkish relations, largely through diplomatic pressure and back-channel discussions with Europe. She concludes that U.S. pressure was “critical” in moving Turkey’s EU candidacy along between 1998 and 2006, despite disagreements over the Iraq war. But her evidence does not support this claim: outspoken diplomacy failed outright, and quiet diplomacy was not nearly as important as domestic electoral change within Europe. As right-wing parties opposed to Turkey’s bid for EU membership gained power in Europe during the past decade, U.S. influence declined. Despite its suspect conclusions, this book is an interesting study of the enduring closeness between Europe and the United States. Their political discourses dovetail, facilitating steady cooperation that overcomes occasional disagreements.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."
32,Immigrant Nations,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2012-01-01/immigrant-nations,Immigrant Nations,"The Netherlands offers a striking example of the dilemmas that immigration creates for Western societies. Despite its small size, it is not, and never was, a unitary polity. Rather, it is a divided nation that traditionally has managed complex religious, regional, and ideological differences through political institutions intricately designed for conflict resolution and power sharing. Scheffer argues that over the past two decades, these institutions have been undermined in part, but not solely, by immigration, and he believes the Netherlands and other Western countries must recognize that multiculturalism has failed. They must reconsider and broaden their conceptions of national identity, based on liberal democratic pluralism, and draw up stricter selection criteria for immigrants consistent with those values. Lest Amer­icans crow about the superiority of their system, Scheffer points out that the American and European experiences are more similar than different and stresses that work needs to be done on both sides of the Atlantic. The book is in some ways self-indulgent, ranging too broadly across history, philosophy, and personal experience. Still, the result should be required reading for those engaged with this important issue.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

Americans, it is said, reside in a nation of immigrants and are thus civic nationalists, committed to a constitution and political values. Europeans reside in nations of blood and memory and are thus cultural or ethnic nationalists, committed to distinctive languages, territories, and cultures. Americans, living on an isolated continent, remain intensely proud, whereas Europeans, having lived through the long-term project of European integration, are now comfortably postnational. American nationalism is bound up with militarism; European nationalism is based more on social welfare ideals. Kramer takes aim at such simple dichotomies. He rejects the notion of a purely civic U.S. nationalism, noting that Americans are just as attached as Europeans to specific geographic attributes, historical memories, cultural traits, and political habits. A reexamination of American and European nationalisms calls for a great book; unfortunately, this is not it. Kramer deserves credit for challenging reductive shibboleths, but he too often glides over the surface of important questions, glossing over history in a questionable manner.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

Yet Sisman, a serial biographer of famous Englishmen, has produced a book that captivates the reader. Hugh Trevor-Roper, a country doctor’s son, rose through England’s brutal public schools and private universities to become a prominent public intellectual and an establishment snob, riding to hounds by day, drinking claret by night, and marrying an earl’s daughter. Precocious and brilliant, yet rash and arrogant, Trevor-Roper embodied the contradictions of the worldly academic. He achieved celebrity by exploiting his wartime experiences as an intelligence officer to publish The Last Days of Hitler. Thereafter, he penned popular pieces for the London Times and brilliant critical essays but failed to produce a magnum opus, perhaps fearing vengeful criticism from those he had earlier provoked. His career ultimately ended in ignominy after he vouched for the authenticity of phony Hitler diaries. They just do not make historians, or public lives, like this anymore.

Berlusconi’s Italy Explained for Posterity and Friends Abroad;  The Liberty of Servants: Berlusconi’s Italy,"After ruling Italy for most of the past 17 years, Silvio Berlusconi seems to have left office for good. But the questions raised by his rule remain. Severgnini, a prominent Italian columnist, has made a career of cross-cultural interpretation, explaining Italy to Anglophones and Anglo-Saxon life to Italians. He is a savvy and engaging writer, and this conversational book is a solid, if somewhat predictable, introduction to the Berlusconi saga. For all of Berlusconi’s faults -- indeed, in large part because of them -- he came across to many Italians as simpatico. The more he partied, acquired material possessions, and fooled around (while praising his family), the more people seemed to like him, at least up to a point. As prime minister, he exploited a remarkable knack for salesmanship and seduction. His professed religiosity and anticommunism tapped into a deep postwar conservative vein in Italy. The literate Italian public -- meaning those who regularly read newspapers and books, watch serious TV news, and browse the Web -- is surprisingly small, a trend exacerbated by Berlusconi’s control over the media. Normal checks and balances did not work, because the Italian legal process could neither convict him of corruption nor force him to divest himself of his media empire, and left-wing parties were too divided and bereft of new ideas to compete."

This well-edited and attractively presented volume provides readers with significantly more thoughtful and wider-ranging information than they will easily find on the Web; students in particular would be wise to consult it. Except in its language, which is uniformly accessible and mercifully free of the jargon that plagues contemporary scholarship, this encyclopedia reflects the atmosphere and the concerns of the contemporary academic community as effectively as Diderot’s encyclopedia reflected the French Enlightenment.

An analysis that showed how Adolf Hitler’s views of the United States affected key policy decisions would be an important work of intellectual and political history. Unfortunately, after a strong beginning, in which Fischer looks at Hitler’s exposure to German writers on the United States, such as Karl May, a chronicler of cowboy stories, the book loses its focus and discipline. This is understandable: there are so many dimensions to the interactions between Hitler and the United States that foreign policy, economic planning, anti-Semitism, and military history all have a part to play. But Fischer gets so caught up with the complexities of the subject that he never manages to pull together an integrated portrait of Hitler’s view of the United States. As a result, this interesting and well-researched book never quite fulfills its potential.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

Now, they are increasingly concerned that the American power on which that order rests must be renewed at home, or else it will fail abroad. Although noting the achievements of other countries, especially China, the authors believe that the United States does not need to imitate others so much as renew its commitment to policies and ideas rooted in its own past. In particular, the authors propose a return to the idea of a strong national government, committed to sound finance and acting as the partner of and advocate for a vigorous private sector. They support substantial public investments in infrastructure (including high-speed rail) and alternative methods of energy generation, and they want to see social welfare entitlements rationalized and trimmed. This is a book that the Tea Party and Occupy Wall Street will both reject. But the authors, bent on appealing to centrists and moderates on both sides of the aisle, are not too worried about persuading those further out on the left and the right.

He is always humane and courteous in his approach, but this does not prevent the occasional deft ­insertion of a stiletto between the ribs of various judges with whom he served. Whether he is lifting an eyebrow at the gold stripes with which Chief Justice William Rehnquist adorned his robe, deploring the Court’s increasing bias toward the prosecution in capital cases, or probing the weak spots of originalism, Stevens is always clear and frequently entertaining. Future chief justices would do well to read this book in preparation for their duties.

And it seems that nation building is almost as hard to write about as it is to do. Suri’s book explores many of the complexities and ambiguities surrounding the task, examining a broad range of historical examples, including the Reconstruction era in the American South and recent U.S. efforts in Afghanistan and Iraq. Suri does a decent job of identifying highlights, low points, and continuing dilemmas. But the ­historical complexity of each episode is given short shrift by superficial narrative summaries, and Suri’s analysis can be puzzling. The deepest confusion may result from his failure to distinguish sufficiently between nation building among consenting Americans, such as the creation of the American republic from the original 13 colonies, and attempts to build foreign nations around American values. Still, Suri’s core conclusion is sound: nation building is difficult, expensive, and unpleasant, and at best it can be only partially ­successful -- but it is often unavoidable.

In this collection of essays, he addresses all the central issues of recent U.S. strategy: the maintenance of primacy and the prospective rise of China, humanitarian intervention and the struggles in Afghanistan and Iraq, and the problems posed by weapons of mass destruction, terrorism, and the possibility of a link between the two. This is not mainstream international relations scholarship. Betts combines serious thought, common sense, and deep historical knowledge, rather than simply applying abstract theories, and his conclusions are expressed in plain English, rather than with mathematical models. His judgments are therefore contingent, but they are always considered and often incisive. Betts is not opposed to the occasional use of force for the right purposes, and he explains why it is difficult to get strategic policy right. But he deplores the persistent American tendency toward military activism, especially in pursuit of what he describes as a “liberal empire.” As he himself recognizes, he is by no means a lone voice arguing for American restraint, but he is certainly among the most articulate.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

The most egregious contemporary examples of both phenomena took place during the Bush administration’s push for an invasion of Iraq in 2002 and 2003. As a member of the U.S. National Intelligence Council, Pillar was responsible for some of the estimates the administration used to justify the war. He provides a vigorous and hard-hitting insider’s account, drawing particular attention to prescient prewar assessments of what postconflict Iraq would look like and the likely regional consequences of war. As information is always incomplete and has to be supplemented by broader judgments, Pillar is wary of the concept of intelligence “failures” and offers some trenchant observations on inquiries into them, such as the 9/11 Commission, which he suggests lead to misguided reforms that do little to prevent the politicization of intelligence."
43,Can Intervention Work?,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2012-01-01/can-intervention-work,Can Intervention Work?,"This book consists of a joint introduction followed by an essay from each contributor. Knaus writes about Bosnia, a relatively successful case of international intervention. His essay is worthy and informative, although he sometimes seems to advocate approaches that the introduction suggests are unwise. Stewart’s essay is persuasively and elegantly written. Stewart mocks formulaic approaches to intervention and rejects almost all policy prescriptions for Afghanistan other than extracting foreign troops as soon and as gracefully as possible. His basic aim is to warn against meddling in societies without a deep knowledge of their languages, politics, and cultures. Stewart swears he is not nostalgic for a time when colonial administrators ruled foreign lands and remained in their posts for decades. Nonetheless, as a former soldier, diplomat, adventurer, academic, and now parliamentarian, he does cut a rather nineteenth-century figure. One imagines Stewart would have been at home dispensing wise, if occasionally rough, justice in the outposts of the British Empire, working with local people whose customs and power structures he had learned to respect.

It addresses not only the full spectrum of energy sources, from coal to photovoltaic cells, but also the rich history and politics of the industry. The book contains many colorful anecdotes involving figures who shaped the energy business and influenced how the public understands energy, including Svante Arrhenius, who in 1894 became the first to conjecture that there was a relationship between atmospheric carbon dioxide and the earth’s temperature but, as a Swede who had lived through cold Nordic winters, welcomed the prospect of global warming as people burned more coal.

Moran reviews and synthesizes the latest research on the various impacts of the foreign direct investment made by multinationals in developing countries. Few sweeping generalizations hold up. The circumstances surrounding particular investments are of paramount importance and are usually influenced by the policies and negotiating skills of the governments in the target countries. There are important differences among various forms of foreign investment -- in natural resources, infrastructure, manufacturing, and services. At least one generalization does seem to hold, although perhaps not universally: investment abroad by U.S.-based multinationals does not reduce employment in the United States. On the contrary, it generally supports employment at home. Moran believes much of the available research on multinationals is inadequate. He strongly urges supplementing cross-country regression analysis with case studies, including comparative case studies, which yield deeper insights into what is actually happening.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

In a bit of futurology, the authors imagine the world in 2050, when today’s rich countries, especially European nations and Japan, have receded in relative importance, and today’s emerging markets have become more powerful -- all while the world’s population has continued to grow, resulting in increased demand for food, energy, water, and much else.

He points to a lack of moral guidance for modern capitalism. Every well-functioning society, he argues, follows certain rules of behavior, sometimes embodied in law but often rooted in informal conventions that developed over a long period of time. Neglect of these rules can lead to serious deficiencies in economic mechanisms, above all in the financial sector. He acknowledges the difficulty in proving his case with hard data but offers examples to illustrate his main points, including an interesting discussion of increasing nonproductive rent seeking over intellectual property of dubious social value. The book involves more diagnosis and lamentation than prescriptions, since Yavlinsky is fully aware that moral behavior cannot be built, or rebuilt, with a stroke of the pen. He does not, unfortunately, contemplate the possibility that the main actors in the financial crisis thought that their behavior was above reproach and socially valuable but were badly misled by a flawed antiregulatory doctrine.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

Unlike many studies on climate change, it discusses significant sources of emissions other than the burning of fossil fuels, such as deforestation and agriculture. It also includes a brief but informative treatment of geoengineering, a range of unorthodox approaches that might be able to offset global warming more rapidly or extensively than conventional means. The authors conclude that the obstacles to abatement are numerous and diverse -- but so are the possibilities for overcoming or bypassing them. Rather than a top-down global scheme, a “polycentric” approach to abatement -- many actions organized by many different individuals or organizations in multiple cultural environments -- will be desirable and indeed necessary. (The two are not mutually exclusive, so long as one does not discourage the other.)

Today, elections that are not observed are widely seen as undemocratic, as Iran discovered in 2009. Hyde is especially puzzled by “electoral autocrats,” such as Vladimir Putin, who welcome foreign monitors to judge their elections even though doing so risks repudiation. The book’s argument is that leaders invite election observers as a “costly signal” to the outside world that their political system meets international standards, expecting that benefits will follow. Behind this argument is a more general observation that states adopt international norms not out of moral obligation but rather out of rational self-interest. Hyde speculates about how this logic might apply to a wider array of international norms that have spread within the developing world, including the adoption of gender quotas in government, the establishment of central banks, the hiring of credit-rating agencies, and the presence of international weapons inspectors. Unfortunately, this more general account of the rise and spread of international norms remains largely implicit.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

In this provocative study, Nincic observes that American foreign-policy makers tend to resort to “negative pressures,” such as the use of force, coercive diplomacy, and economic sanctions. Less appreciated and less understood, Nincic argues, are the tools and strategies of “engagement,” policies that use positive inducements to alter the incentives and orientations of other states. Nincic is surely correct: policymakers know more about the use of sticks than carrots. The book seeks to explain the bias in American foreign policy toward threats and punishments and argues that it is a legacy of the Cold War, which taught politicians to worry about charges of appeasement. Nincic also sees biases in the American security-studies community, where, he claims, realist understandings of the world shift attention away from nonmilitary tools of influence. The book’s most useful contribution is to spell out how strategies of engagement and positive inducements can work, using the United States’ experiences with Cuba, Iran, Libya, North Korea, and Syria as case studies.

Building on Daniel Thomas’ book The Helsinki Effect, Snyder shows how the “Helsinki process” triggered by the agreement influenced both Western and Eastern governments to pursue policies that facilitated the rise of organized dissent in Eastern Europe and built pressure for human rights reform in the Soviet Union. Forgotten U.S. officials, such as Representative Millicent Fenwick and Arthur Goldberg, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, play a role in the story, as do countless figures inside the Soviet bloc who found common cause in creating a network of groups that could monitor compliance with the Helsinki commitments and expose human rights abuses. In this rendering, it was not containment that won the Cold War but the relentless efforts of activists, journalists, lawyers, minority-rights advocates, and diplomats who worked across borders to set the stage for the political earthquakes that followed.

In this collection of essays, distinguished scholars offer reflections on the past struggles and ­accomplishments of left-leaning parties in Europe and the United States and speculate about their future. The golden era of postwar Western social democracy ended in the 1970s as economies stagnated, the Keynesian consensus broke down, and economic globalization placed limits on national governments’ ability to manage their economies, protect workers, and provide social services. The neoliberalism of the Reagan-Thatcher years emerged as a rival vision of society and the market. Bill Clinton’s “New Covenant” and Tony Blair’s “New Labour” showed that center-left parties could achieve electoral success by combining neoliberal economics with traditional social liberalism. The book makes the important point that as advanced societies navigate the current moment of global economic uncertainty, liberals and social democrats have a new opportunity to regroup and rethink policies that promote economic security and social justice.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

This is one of the most fraught questions of modern diplomacy. Reiss’ important book offers some of the most lucid and sensible reflections yet on the topic. A scholar of international security and a former diplomat, Reiss led American participation in the peace talks over Northern Ireland. He argues against simplistic views that either favor or oppose engagement. Sometimes negotiations work, and sometimes they make the situation worse. Reiss suggests that states need to know whether a terrorist adversary is capable of evolving and abandoning its violence and whether its leadership has the authority to make binding deals. Often, the negotiations need to be secret, and governments need to be willing to walk away. Reiss sifts through the encounters that Western governments have had with some of the most notorious terrorist groups, including the Irish Republican Army, the Basque separatist group ETA, and Sri Lanka’s Tamil Tigers. As in Ireland, successful negotiations can take decades, during which states must continue efforts to degrade the terrorist organization and look for leaders who want to transform it into a more traditional political movement.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

It is conceivable that the Occupy Wall Street movement will gain traction, but the most dynamic recent populist movement to date has been the right-wing Tea Party, whose main target is the regulatory state that seeks to protect ordinary people from financial speculators. Something similar is true in Europe as well, where the left is anemic and right-wing populist parties are on the move."
57,When Currencies Collapse,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/world/when-currencies-collapse,When Currencies Collapse,"The international monetary system rests on just two currencies: the dollar and the euro. Together, they account for nearly 90 percent of the foreign exchange reserves held by central banks and governments. They make up nearly 80 percent of the value of Special Drawing Rights, the reserve asset used in transactions between the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and its members. Of all debt securities denominated in a foreign currency, more than three-quarters are in dollars and euros. The two currencies together account for nearly two-thirds of all trading in foreign exchange markets worldwide. They are the essential lubricants of global trade and finance. Were they not widely accepted, the global economy could not sustain current levels of international trade and investment."
58,The Future of the Yuan,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2011-12-15/future-yuan,The Future of the Yuan,"According to a growing chorus of pundits and economists, China—already the world’s most prolific exporter, largest sovereign creditor, and second-largest economy—will someday soon provide the world’s reserve currency. According to this view, just as the dollar dethroned the British pound in the interwar years, so the yuan will soon displace the dollar, striking a blow to U.S. interests. As the economist Arvind Subramanian recently wrote, the yuan “could become the premier reserve currency by the end of this decade, or early next decade.”"
59,Making Modernity Work,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2012-01-01/making-modernity-work,Making Modernity Work,"We are living, so we are told, through an ideological crisis. The United States is trapped in political deadlock and dysfunction, Europe is broke and breaking, authoritarian China is on the rise. Protesters take to the streets across the advanced industrial democracies; the high and mighty meet in Davos to search for “new models” as sober commentators ponder who and what will shape the future."
60,"Balancing the East, Upgrading the West",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/united-states/balancing-east-upgrading-west,"Balancing the East, Upgrading the West","The United States' central challenge over the next several decades is to revitalize itself, while promoting a larger West and buttressing a complex balance in the East that can accommodate China's rising global status. A successful U.S. effort to enlarge the West, making it the world's most stable and democratic zone, would seek to combine power with principle. A cooperative larger West -- extending from North America and Europe through Eurasia (by eventually embracing Russia and Turkey), all the way to Japan and South Korea -- would enhance the appeal of the West's core principles for other cultures, thus encouraging the gradual emergence of a universal democratic political culture."
61,The Failure of the Euro,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/europe/2012-01-01/failure-euro,The Failure of the Euro,"The euro should now be recognized as an experiment that failed. This failure, which has come after just over a dozen years since the euro was introduced, in 1999, was not an accident or the result of bureaucratic mismanagement but rather the inevitable consequence of imposing a single currency on a very heterogeneous group of countries. The adverse economic consequences of the euro include the sovereign debt crises in several European countries, the fragile condition of major European banks, high levels of unemployment across the eurozone, and the large trade deficits that now plague most eurozone countries."
62,Can the Center Hold?,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/israel/2011-12-10/can-center-hold,Can the Center Hold?,"A majority of Israelis -- around 70 percent, according to a recent poll by the Truman Institute for the Advancement of Peace, in Jerusalem -- support a two-state solution. Yet that same majority is deeply skeptical of Palestinian intentions. To understand this seeming contradiction and the psyche of the Israeli mainstream, one should read the two articles that recently appeared in these pages on the Palestinian question -- ""The Problem Is Palestinian Rejectionism,"" by Yosef Kuperwasser and Shalom Lipner, and ""Israel's Bunker Mentality,"" by Ronald Krebs (November/December 2011) -- not as a debate but as complementary arguments. Centrist Israelis endorse Krebs' argument that the occupation is an existential threat to the Jewish state. They understand that ending it would ease the demographic challenge to Israel's Jewish majority and allow Israel to retain both its Jewish and its democratic identities. A two-state solution would also deflate the growing international movement to delegitimize not only the occupation but also the existence of Israel itself."
63,Ideas Man,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/ideas-man,Ideas Man,"The first book to complicate the reputation of George Kennan came out in 1967. It was 600 pages long, and the cover would show a forlorn young man staring right at you. The tale was of an awkward boy from the Midwest who never quite fits in. He gains knowledge in the Foreign Service and becomes the United States' wisest Soviet analyst. Then, for a brief -- but crucial -- moment, he serves as the head of the State Department's Policy Planning Staff under President Harry Truman, helping remake the world after World War II. Along the way, he writes the ""Long Telegram"" and the ""X"" article, which laid out a strategy forever known as containment, and he plays a central role in designing the Marshall Plan. He writes beautiful memos that anticipate the dangers of keeping Germany divided and starting an arms race. But soon he grows irritated with Washington, and Washington grows irritated with him. He becomes as bitter as he is brilliant, as frustrated as he is farsighted. The story ends with him out of power, despairing for the republic. The book hints that its subject might be anti-Semitic, depressed, and professionally inept."
64,Talking Tough to Pakistan,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/pakistan/2011-11-29/talking-tough-pakistan,Talking Tough to Pakistan,"Late last month, after a NATO engagement in Pakistan went wrong and left 25 Pakistani troops dead, the West scrambled to get its story straight. Anders Fogh Rasmussen, NATO's secretary-general, quickly called the battle a “tragic unintended accident.” The White House waffled; President Barack Obama later expressed regret over the incident but did not apologize. Islamabad, meanwhile, castigated the United States for violating its sovereignty, closed the Torkham border crossing, and announced it would sit out the recent Bonn conference on Afghanistan."

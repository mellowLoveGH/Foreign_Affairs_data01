0,The Secret Listener: An Ingenue in  Mao’s Court,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2022-02-22/secret-listener-ingenue-maos-court,The Secret Listener: An Ingenue in  Mao’s Court,"In this beautifully crafted memoir, Chen, who lived in China during the first years of Communist Party rule, before immigrating to Hong Kong in the 1970s, seeks to counteract the “Orwellian rewriting” of the Cultural Revolution underway in Beijing. Authorities have blandly recast the period as part of a decade of “arduous exploration and development achievement,” suppressing the story of its upheaval and brutality. By contrast, the now 90-year-old Chen depicts a tumultuous time, when she and many other intellectuals faced incredibly difficult choices—to stay or leave, to speak out or remain silent—as the Chinese leader Mao Zedong encouraged the radical social and political transformation of the country. Mao’s disastrous Great Leap Forward precipitated mass starvation, and several years later, the Cultural Revolution caused further suffering, with, for instance, teachers beaten to death and prominent writers and artists driven to commit suicide after facing intense ritual denunciations. Chen moved in elite circles, and some specialists will be most fascinated by vignettes featuring Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai and other notable figures. But equally illuminating are the book’s deeply empathetic portraits of more ordinary people, from minor members of Beijing’s literary world to villagers Chen befriended after she was exiled to the countryside. The book is thus a good antidote not just to official, sanitized versions of China’s past but also to flattened-out portrayals of Mao’s China as peopled by neatly separate groups of perpetrators and victims. As in other tragic times, the Cultural Revolution was one in which people could alternate between both roles."
1,Religious Pluralism in Indonesia: Threats and Opportunities for Democracy,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2022-02-22/religious-pluralism-indonesia-threats-and-opportunities-democracy,Religious Pluralism in Indonesia: Threats and Opportunities for Democracy,"Close to 90 percent of Indonesians are Muslim, but there are five other officially recognized religions in the country, plus hundreds of folk and new religions. To knit the country together, Sukarno, one of Indonesia’s founders, articulated the principle of the political equality of all religions. But in deference to Muslim sensibilities, he added that all should recognize one God—placing religions such as Buddhism, Confucianism, Hinduism, and folk traditions in an ambiguous position of being tolerated but not fully approved of. As this lively, informative multi-author volume shows, Islamists from the beginning argued that Indonesia should be an Islamic state, and they pressed this demand with renewed force after the country’s transition to democracy in 1998. Indonesia has witnessed an increase in observant behavior among Muslims, the widening of a policy role for a semiofficial Islamic council, the incorporation of principles of sharia into regional law codes, more prosecutions of non-Muslims for blasphemy, and rising support for Islamist movements and parties. Christian and Hindu populations have reacted by imposing their own values on minorities in regions where they dominate. Sukarno’s optimistic template for tolerant pluralism has given way to hardening boundaries along religious lines."
2,Three Books on Social and Political Life in China,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2022-02-22/three-books-social-and-political-life-china,Three Books on Social and Political Life in China,"These three books provide insights into Chinese social and political life at the grassroots, far from the high politics of Beijing. Scoggins’s enterprising fieldwork finds the fabled Chinese police state to be surprisingly ineffective at the level of the street. The regime is so obsessed with “stability maintenance”—surveilling dissidents, detaining petitioners, and snuffing out protests—that the mundane work of protecting citizens and solving crimes “limps along as overworked, underpaid, and poorly trained officers struggle to get through another week.” As a result, she argues, the police often ignore crimes, resolve cases by bribing victims to withdraw their complaints, or close them by torturing suspects to get them to confess. Low pay and lax supervision open the way for corruption. Reform mandates sent out from Beijing serve only to increase paperwork and reduce efficiency. Ironically, popular dissatisfaction with the police stimulates the very protests and petitioning that the stability maintenance program is designed to suppress."
3,The Digital Silk Road: China’s Quest to Wire the World and Win the Future,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2022-02-22/digital-silk-road-chinas-quest-wire-world-and-win-future,The Digital Silk Road: China’s Quest to Wire the World and Win the Future,"Hillman shows how Western companies, hungry for access to the Chinese market, allowed their digital technology to be hacked, stolen, transferred, and copied, and how the resulting Chinese-manufactured equipment, produced at low prices with state support, has been installed all around the world, including in the United States. If this process continues, it could confer on China the power to set hardware and software standards for future equipment; expand the network of Chinese-made cables, switches, and satellites; and allow China to collect information on individuals and countries, silence critics, and, if desired, turn off other countries’ communications, transport, banking, and water systems. The country is poised, in Chinese President Xi Jinping’s words, “to dominate advanced technology manufacturing by 2025, to lead standard setting by 2035, and to become a global superpower by 2050.” Western governments began to push back only when the Chinese strategy was already well advanced, but Hillman argues that the contest is not over. He advises leading democracies and major emerging markets to invest cooperatively in research and development, set open technical standards and ethical norms that promote freer societies, and provide public support to help their private firms market high-quality equipment at competitive prices."
4,India Before Modi: How the BJP Came to Power,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2022-02-22/india-modi-how-bjp-came-power,India Before Modi: How the BJP Came to Power,"Since the 1920s, Hindu nationalists in India have labored to create a political arm that could win elections by unifying Hindus across divisions of caste and region. This electoral component went through several incarnations, emerging in 1980 as today’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, which mobilizes its vote base on a fear of enemies at home and abroad, especially Muslims. Sitapati offers an innovative analysis of the party’s evolution by focusing on the intertwined lives of two of its founders, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, a member of Parliament and three-time prime minister, and Lal Krishna Advani, a longtime activist, parliamentarian, and party official. Sitapati’s sweeping and richly textured account details how the two initially moderate leaders led the party through a series of victories and defeats, in the process stirring up an intense culture of “defensive violence” among their followers, which eventually led to several tragic incidents of mass violence by Hindu mobs. As the party became more radical, a new and younger leader arose from within its ranks: Narendra Modi, who as prime minister today is driving India in an increasingly exclusionary and authoritarian direction."
5,Revolutionary Life: The Everyday of the Arab Spring,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2022-02-22/revolutionary-life-everyday-arab-spring,Revolutionary Life: The Everyday of the Arab Spring,"Bayat, a sociologist and an acute chronicler of everyday life in the Middle East and North Africa, explores the fate of marginalized people in the uprisings of the Arab Spring, particularly in Egypt and Tunisia. He concedes that from a conventional, state-centric perspective, these uprisings failed as revolutions. But he argues that the experience of liberation, brief as it may have been, changed the self-image and, to some degree, the political efficacy of women, young people, workers in the informal economy, and what he labels the “middle-class poor,” the vast numbers of unemployed university graduates. “The rise of a new imaginary . . . , which the new rulers could not simply overlook,” enabled political reform in Morocco; social, cultural, and religious transformation in Saudi Arabia; and perhaps even the prominent role of women in the Egyptian cabinet. The uprisings succeeded indirectly; autocrats co-opted reform to placate the new aspirations and expectations of populations that had tasted freedom and dignity. This is a partial victory, no doubt, but Bayat insists that “the chronicle of the Arab Spring . . . is not simply doom, gloom, and failure.”"
6,A Sultan in Autumn: Erdogan Faces Turkey’s Uncontainable Forces,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2022-02-22/sultan-autumn-erdogan-faces-turkeys-uncontainable-forces,A Sultan in Autumn: Erdogan Faces Turkey’s Uncontainable Forces,"This slim volume provides a brisk and informative review of the Turkish political scene, particularly Ankara’s foreign policy, through an examination of the recent political fortunes of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Arguing that Erdogan is “an autocrat ruling a democracy,” Cagaptay suggests that his successful transformation of Turkish democracy from a parliamentary to a presidential system in 2018 may eventually haunt him. Not only has the resulting centralization of power deprived Erdogan of the relatively diverse circle of political allies and advisers once supplied by a coalition government; it also seems to be providing an incentive for the opposition to band together to defeat him in the scheduled 2023 elections. Cagaptay usefully parses the head-spinning convolutions of recent Turkish foreign policy, tracing various regional and global fault lines into which Turkey has inserted itself, including in Azerbaijan, Libya, Syria, and eastern Mediterranean gas fields. He usefully highlights the contradictions of Erdogan’s reliance on Russian President Vladimir Putin in the context of Turkey’s long-standing distrust of Russia. Erdogan is widely criticized for his promotion of political Islam and for his highhanded dismissal of the civil and political rights of his critics, but Cagaptay suggests his future will be decided by the now flagging Turkish economy."
7,Deception: Russiagate and the New  Cold War,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2022-02-22/deception-russiagate-and-new-cold-war,Deception: Russiagate and the New  Cold War,"Sakwa contends that the investigations into “Russiagate”—the alleged collusion of the Russian government with Donald Trump ahead of the 2016 U.S. presidential election—were politically biased and rested on unverified material. In the end, the main investigation, headed by the U.S. special counsel Robert Mueller, concluded that the Russian government and the Trump campaign did not engage in a criminal conspiracy, thus throwing cold water on the notion that Trump owed his victory to Russian interference and was therefore beholden to Russian President Vladimir Putin. The investigations themselves, Sakwa argues, did grave damage to the United States by exacerbating the polarization of U.S. society, compromising the media, and politicizing the security services. Russiagate reduced relations between the United States and Russia to a new Cold War and ruled out any rapprochement between them. Sakwa is not the first to make these points, but his is an exceptionally detailed and well-documented account of all the major episodes covered by the Trump-Russia probes. He aims to help his audience “understand the main issues and facts” of Russiagate. But in the divisive social and political environment that spurred the investigations in the first place, his argument is unlikely to change the minds of those Americans who were anxious to blame outside forces for the defeat of Trump’s 2016 opponent, Hillary Clinton."
8,Faustian Bargain: The Soviet-German Partnership and the Origins of the Second World War,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2022-02-22/faustian-bargain-soviet-german-partnership-and-origins-second,Faustian Bargain: The Soviet-German Partnership and the Origins of the Second World War,"Drawing on archives in five countries, Johnson delves into the fascinating secret military cooperation between Germany and the Soviet Union in the interwar period. After the end of World War I, a defeated and disarmed Germany sought ways to rearm despite the severe restrictions imposed by the Treaty of Versailles. Meanwhile, most major powers refused to recognize the new Bolshevik government in Russia, which was in dire need of investment and foreign assistance to build up its armed forces. The two countries’ pariah status drew them together. The Soviet Union provided a place—beyond the reach of Allied inspectors—for the research, development, and testing of German combat aircraft, tanks, and chemical weapons. Cooperation with Germany played a crucial role in the development of the Soviet military industry and Red Army cadres. Thousands of Soviet military officers trained alongside their German counterparts. Later on, Hitler’s massive rearmament was enabled in part by the military capabilities that Germany had developed in the Soviet Union before the Nazis came to power. Hitler ended German-Soviet military cooperation in 1933, soon after he became chancellor. But in 1939, the two countries grew close again: they signed the Treaty of Nonaggression, renewed their military ties, and agreed to partition eastern Europe between them. Their extensive trade partnership continued until Germany invaded the Soviet Union in 1941."
9,We Shall Be Masters: Russian Pivots to East Asia From Peter the Great to Putin,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2022-02-22/we-shall-be-masters-russian-pivots-east-asia-peter-great-putin,We Shall Be Masters: Russian Pivots to East Asia From Peter the Great to Putin,"Miller’s broad historical overview of Russian foreign policy in Asia challenges the conventional view that the country has enduring interests in the Far East. He demonstrates that over the past two centuries, Russia has followed periods of deep engagement in Asia—involving territorial expansion, military buildups, and the intensification of commercial ties—with times of neglect and disengagement. For instance, in the early nineteenth century, Russia established colonies in Alaska and California but soon came to see those outposts as an unprofitable distraction and gave them up to the Americans. In the 1860s, Russia conquered the territories around the Amur and Ussuri Rivers, on the Chinese border, but made no use of those sparsely populated lands for three decades. Soviet leaders sought to build a broad anti-imperialist front in Asia, but hostilities with China undermined that effort. By the 1980s, the Soviet Union’s influence in Asia had significantly decreased. For Russia, Miller argues, Asia has been a land of unfulfilled promises, which makes him skeptical about the long-term prospects of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s current pivot to the east and his attempted rapprochement with China."
10,The Volga: A History of Russia’s Greatest River,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2022-02-22/volga-history-russias-greatest-river,The Volga: A History of Russia’s Greatest River,"Hartley’s chronological narrative, rich in vivid detail, begins over 1,000 years ago, when the principality of Kievan Rus vied with the Khazar Khaganate and the Bulgars for the lucrative trade on the Volga River. By the mid-sixteenth century, Tsar Ivan IV had established control along the entire length of the river, thereby turning Russia into a multiethnic and multiconfessional empire. The Russian state’s dominance, however, was not yet secure: in the eighteenth century, the Volga was the scene of massive Cossack revolts that sparked outbursts of peasant violence. Russian authorities struggled to protect the transportation of valuable goods on the Volga against banditry. Hartley offers a fascinating account of the logistics of navigating the Volga before the introduction of steamships, including the herculean work of barge haulers, who had to drag boats upstream. In the nineteenth century, the Volga, which had once been the marker of a frontier, came to be seen as an intrinsically Russian river, the “Mother Volga” glorified in art, music, poetry, and later also film. In 1943, the Battle of Stalingrad, fought on the river’s west bank, produced the ultimate victory of the Soviet Union over Nazi Germany and reinforced the Volga’s standing as a powerful national symbol."
11,Beyond: The Astonishing Story of the First Human to Leave Our Planet and Journey Into Space,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2022-02-22/beyond-astonishing-story-first-human-leave-our-planet-and-journey,Beyond: The Astonishing Story of the First Human to Leave Our Planet and Journey Into Space,"Walker’s enthralling book covers the early stages of the space race, when the Soviet Union—despite the country’s utter devastation in World War II, in which 27 million Soviet citizens perished—demonstrated technological supremacy over the United States, the world’s richest and most advanced country. In 1961, the Soviet Union launched the first man into space. U.S. President John F. Kennedy, then newly in office, did not prioritize the space race with the Soviet Union; he was focused instead on Soviet meddling in Cuba. The Bay of Pigs invasion, which Kennedy secretly authorized, ended in a disaster just days after the Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin triumphantly orbited the earth. Walker’s narrative alternates between Soviet preparations for Gagarin’s flight and U.S. preparations for the United States’ first manned flight. It culminates in a suspenseful 50-page account of Gagarin’s 108-minute journey that reads in one breath. The Soviet space program was strictly classified. Gagarin’s name was first made public only when he was already in orbit; Sergey Korolyov, the program’s chief designer, was not identified by name until after his death in 1966; and some of the serious malfunctions during Gagarin’s flight remained secret until the Soviet Union’s collapse in 1991."
12,"States of Belonging: Immigration Policies, Attitudes, and Inclusion",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2022-02-22/states-belonging-immigration-policies-attitudes-and-inclusion,"States of Belonging: Immigration Policies, Attitudes, and Inclusion","Through extensive surveys and in-depth interviews, the authors contrast the pro-immigration policies of New Mexico with the more hostile policies of neighboring Arizona. Not surprisingly, Latinos feel more welcome in New Mexico. Their degree of comfort and belonging in the state affords them greater material, as well as valuable psychological, benefits. Interestingly, many white people—mostly liberal Democrats—also gain psychologically from New Mexico’s immigration-friendly climate, which validates their liberal values. Not everybody agrees, of course: white Republicans in New Mexico report a decreased sense of social belonging. In Arizona, anti-immigration policies alienate not only Latinos but also liberal white people, who, according to surveys, feel less attached to the state as a result. Encouragingly, the authors find broad bipartisan sympathy in these two states and across the country for a legal pathway to citizenship for worthy immigrants, even if meaningful immigration reform at the federal level remains elusive. Instead, the authors place their hope in state-level reforms. California, which in the 1990s adopted several anti-immigration measures, is now the most pro-immigration state in the country because of its growing Latino population, grassroots organizing, and the general leftward shift among California Democrats. Arizona, the authors suggest, may eventually follow suit."
13,Unrevolutionary Mexico: The Birth of a Strange Dictatorship,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2022-02-22/unrevolutionary-mexico-birth-strange-dictatorship,Unrevolutionary Mexico: The Birth of a Strange Dictatorship,"Gillingham digs deep into the archives of two contrasting Mexican states in the early twentieth century: rural, disorderly Guerrero, on the Pacific coast, and the more urban, cosmopolitan, if fragmented, Veracruz, on the Caribbean coast. He seeks to explain how state builders during the 1940s and 1950s at the provincial and national levels constructed a remarkably enduring system of dictablanda, or “soft dictatorship”—a mixture of conciliation and coercion, competitive democracy and strong-armed authoritarianism that foreshadowed the hybrid regimes increasingly common around the world today. Gillingham explores the repressive violence of official police forces, state-driven socioeconomic modernization, and the elevation by the nation-state of a hegemonic cultural narrative of heroism, altruism, and social justice that sought to suppress radical factionalism. Systemic corruption helped maintain political stability by satisfying dissidents, even as its shocking scale undermined the legitimacy of governments. This soft dictatorship goes some way toward explaining how Mexico avoided the Latin American disease of rule by a full-fledged military dictatorship, but Gillingham forgets geopolitics. The implicit security guarantee (however much Mexican nationalists might refuse to acknowledge it) of the dominant regional power, the United States, and the demilitarization (at least until recently) of the country’s long northern border helped empower civilian leaders in Mexico City."
14,The Last Emperor of Mexico: The Dramatic Story of the Habsburg Archduke Who Created a Kingdom in the New World,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2022-02-22/last-emperor-mexico-dramatic-story-habsburg-archduke-who-created,The Last Emperor of Mexico: The Dramatic Story of the Habsburg Archduke Who Created a Kingdom in the New World,"Shawcross deftly reexamines the tragicomic rule of the Austrian archduke Ferdinand Maximilian, the Habsburg prince whom France briefly imposed on Mexico in the 1860s. Maximilian is often portrayed as a vainglorious buffoon, a quixotic old-school European aristocrat egged on by an ambitious wife. In Shawcross’s persuasive retelling, Maximilian was a well-intentioned, if flawed, Enlightenment ruler buffeted by the great forces of the mid-nineteenth century. Napoleon III, the French emperor, installed Maximilian in Mexico to challenge the growing power of the United States. Ultraconservative Mexican exiles championed him as an autocratic ruler to combat rising republican liberalism. Maximilian tried but failed to reconcile these opposing forces. After the end of the American Civil War, the United States reasserted the Monroe Doctrine, which sought to prevent further European colonization in the Western Hemisphere, and demanded that the French government withdraw from Mexico. Washington backed the uncompromising secular reformer Benito Juárez, who swept aside Maximilian’s forces and ordered the archduke’s execution by firing squad. In The Execution of Maximilian, the French painter Édouard Manet captured the proud stoicism of the defeated, abandoned Habsburg prince. Equally tragic was the fate of his young, brilliant wife, Carlota, who, after futilely pleading with the French emperor and Pope Pius IX for renewed support for her husband’s beleaguered kingdom, lost her sanity."

Moncada’s well-chosen, carefully researched case studies compare the ways in which people have resisted the predations of organized crime in Latin America; he looks at the strategies adopted by small businesses in the city of Medellín, in Colombia; subsistence farmers in El Salvador; and industrial-scale producers of avocados and berries in the Mexican state of Michoacán. These resistance strategies include sporadic vigilante killings of gang members, collective paramilitary defense, the formation of opportunistic alliances with trustworthy security forces, and attempts to negotiate or end extortion payments to criminals. Some victims even managed to reclaim a sense of personal dignity through verbal jousting with gang members. The choice of the method of resistance was contingent on a number of factors, such as whether the criminal activity was a one-off or long term, whether victims could organize their own defense, and whether the criminals had co-opted the police. Moncada acknowledges that some of these actions blurred the line between the legal and extralegal realms and between victims and predators."
16,The Last Neoliberal: Macron and the Origins of France’s Political Crisis,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2022-02-22/last-neoliberal-macron-and-origins-frances-political-crisis,The Last Neoliberal: Macron and the Origins of France’s Political Crisis,"This updated version of a book that first appeared during the 2017 French presidential election—in which Emmanuel Macron prevailed—argues that France has become ungovernable. In the authors’ view, all the major parties in France have given up on the traditional postwar “social-liberal” compromise that combined moves toward fluid labor markets, external openness, and EU cooperation with continued redistribution, social solidarity, and upward mobility. Instead, both left-wing and center-right parties have sacrificed the latter for the former. A center-right “bourgeois bloc” is now pushing this process further, triggering rising inequality and the marginalization of low-wage labor and stoking intense disillusionment and opposition on the traditional left and the far right. Although it is certainly true that in recent decades France has moved toward more free-market policies in some areas, one cannot help sensing that these authors often miss the forest for the trees. Inequality in France today is roughly equal that in Sweden. Its levels of taxation and social spending top the European charts. Its public services—not to mention the five weeks of paid vacation guaranteed for all full-time workers—are the envy of most of its neighbors. If France’s welfare-state model is collapsing, then bring on the collapse!"

This classic book, now translated into English, uses eyewitness accounts from those decades to trace uprisings of workers and students in Italy, a country where the extreme left was particularly strong. Some radicals were inspired by global events: marchers brought placards displaying Mao Zedong and Che Guevara to protests against neocolonial wars in places such as Algeria and Vietnam. Some followed cultural trends in the United Kingdom and the United States: Jack Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg mesmerized Italian writers, the Beatles and the Rolling Stones filled the airwaves, a feminist movement took hold, and parents were unnerved by their long-haired and promiscuous children. Marxist students pressed universities to hire professors committed to the class struggle. After two decades, with the radical left waning, extremist elements took over as masked terrorists threw Molotov cocktails and splinter groups bombed train stations. The Italian state ended it all with a brutal crackdown. This sprawling book vividly portrays the chaos, confusion, and contradictions of those years."
18,Pandemonium: Saving Europe,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2022-02-22/pandemonium-saving-europe,Pandemonium: Saving Europe,"Among the many alarmist policy experts, sensationalistic journalists, idealistic federalists, and spinning politicians who dominate debates over the European Union, the Dutch political philosopher and former policy adviser van Middelaar stands out as a balanced and thoughtful observer. Like his previous books, this one convincingly demolishes the many “false prophets” who over recent decades have predicted that the euro, the Schengen area, the common foreign policy, and even the EU itself cannot survive—a group that includes not just Euroskeptics but also surprisingly many among the EU’s leaders and supporters. Instead, he argues, crises within the EU often elicit pragmatic and permanent reforms, even if they are sometimes slow in coming. Moreover, such initiatives generally come not from a distant EU bureaucracy but from national leaders working together informally in the European Council, comfortably insulated from direct public scrutiny. The author approves of this behind-the-scenes diplomacy, although he depicts it as more egalitarian and legalistic than it really is. Convincing though much of it is, this book, compared with the author’s previous writing, relies more on philosophical pronouncements and less on an insider’s feel for how everyday policymaking works."
19,Western Jihadism: A Thirty-Year History,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2022-02-22/western-jihadism-thirty-year-history,Western Jihadism: A Thirty-Year History,"A striking number of jihadi terrorists grew up in the United States or Europe. Based on an intensive 15-year study of over 6,000 members of global jihadi networks, the author explains why. Jihadis in the West are disproportionately young and are motivated by a deep desire to participate in a social movement that gives their lives meaning, rather than by any immediate experiences of deprivation or discrimination or by extreme religious conviction. Today, Europe is the center of these networks because it is home to a large number of asylum seekers and has relatively lax asylum and criminal laws. This type of jihadi movement is difficult to combat because many individuals act alone, even if their actions are coordinated through (largely online) groups. The good news is that skillful and patient police work can uncover and dismantle such networks. The bad news is that ideologues with concrete geopolitical and religious grievances can effectively harness the groups to stage attacks—and thus the Western jihadi movement shows no signs of disappearing anytime soon."
20,My Secret Brexit Diary: A Glorious Illusion,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2022-02-22/my-secret-brexit-diary-glorious-illusion,My Secret Brexit Diary: A Glorious Illusion,"This book’s title promises lurid and personal revelations. The author—a genially earnest French politician who headed the EU delegation in the Brexit negotiations—delivers neither. Yet his blandness perfectly suits the perspective on Brexit he offers. The European Commission, much maligned on the British right, emerges as a skilled, moderate, and results-oriented institution that entrusts important negotiations to experienced professionals such as Barnier. By contrast, British ministers and officials represented a fractious group of Conservative politicians who had espoused Brexit for reasons more electoral than economic—and thus had little idea what they really wanted or how to get it. Barnier records his surprise as the British side made one tactical error after another, often conceding on major issues without even seeming to grasp what was at stake. At the last minute, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s amateurish effort to circumvent the European Commission entirely by negotiating directly with national leaders collapsed when German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron refused to take his calls. In the end, Europe out-negotiated the United Kingdom across the board. The British people—faced with confusion on the border with Ireland, severe labor and product shortages, and continuing squabbles over a host of issues from fishing to banking—are now paying the price."

Among the many traditional histories and current political commentaries, this book stands out. It charts the extraordinary economic, social, and political transformation of Ireland since 1958, the year the author was born. Before, the country was “a backwater and an irrelevance,” with an “ancient way of life” marked by low economic growth, a stagnant and emigrating population, rigid (if often hypocritical) Catholic moralism, and, O’Toole notes, no running water in most rural houses. To achieve economic and demographic growth, political and religious leaders soon embraced free trade, military cooperation, foreign travel, and Hollywood culture—yet many continued to believe they could maintain premodern practices regarding religion, sexuality, and the traditional family hierarchy. O’Toole reserves his most scathing criticism for the hypocrisy of the last defenders of that old order, above all the Catholic Church. The author, perhaps Ireland’s foremost public intellectual, employs a unique combination of intimately personal narrative, piquant facts and figures, and sharp (often ironic) commentary to describe the experience of this transformation."
22,The Enduring Struggle: The History of the U.S. Agency for International Development and America’s Uneasy Transformation of the World,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2022-02-22/enduring-struggle-history-us-agency-international-development-and,The Enduring Struggle: The History of the U.S. Agency for International Development and America’s Uneasy Transformation of the World,"This comprehensive history of the U.S. Agency for International Development, the U.S. government’s official bilateral foreign aid agency, deserves to be read by all students of U.S. foreign policy. The “enduring struggle” of the title is meant to refer to the difficulties of ending poverty in the developing world. But Norris’s description of the repeated attempts by the White House and the State Department to use USAID to advance foreign policy and strategic goals rather than developmental ones suggests another enduring struggle, in which Washington’s imperatives are more salient than those of low-income countries. Norris ably defends the record of USAID in promoting development but also documents its decline. Under President John F. Kennedy, the agency’s director enjoyed major resources and direct access to the Oval Office. Every president after Kennedy would contribute to USAID’s progressive marginalization, Norris shows, through poor choices of directors to lead the agency, ill-conceived administrative reorganizations, and the decision to allow the agency to lose its autonomy to the State Department. By George W. Bush’s first term, few in Washington objected when the president ignored USAID and preferred to create new bureaucracies to advance major new development initiatives, such as the task of addressing HIV/AIDS."
23,"Performing Power in Nigeria: Identity, Politics, and Pentecostalism",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2022-02-22/performing-power-nigeria-identity-politics-and-pentecostalism,"Performing Power in Nigeria: Identity, Politics, and Pentecostalism","With Pentecostalism as the fastest-growing religion in West Africa, the Pentecostal Church in Nigeria has become a wealthy and influential social actor. In her fine study of the dramaturgy of the church’s rites and rhetoric, Adelakun argues that the emphasis the church puts on affirming its social influence helps develop a narrative of Pentecostal believers as “people of power,” an identity that church members embrace. Drawing examples not only from the liturgy but also from Pentecostal films, plays, and novels in which individuals grapple with the devil successfully thanks to their faith, she shows that the church’s activities can be viewed as performances that embed the Pentecostal spiritual message in everyday practices; this is done in a way that confers a sense of agency on its members. An interesting final chapter recasts the argument in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic: Adelakun suggests that the movement has been put on the defensive by its evident inability to protect members from the disease."
24,Holy War: The Untold Story of Catholic Italy’s Crusade Against the Ethiopian Orthodox Church,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2022-02-22/holy-war-untold-story-catholic-italys-crusade-against-ethiopian,Holy War: The Untold Story of Catholic Italy’s Crusade Against the Ethiopian Orthodox Church,"This stunning book explores the Catholic Church’s support for and encouragement of Mussolini’s campaign against the Ethiopian Orthodox Church during Italy’s invasion and occupation of Ethiopia from 1935 to 1943. Italian forces targeted the Orthodox Church; they ransacked and destroyed hundreds of churches and summarily executed several thousand Ethiopian clergy. Amicable relations had long existed between the Catholic Church in Rome and the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, but the Roman episcopate embraced Mussolini’s regime and its aggressive foreign policy in the mid-1930s. In 1935, Pope Pius XI openly supported the invasion of Ethiopia as a crusade against a country of heretics, schismatics, pagans, and infidels. This papal support of the war, reinforced by church sermons across Italy, helped mobilize volunteers to join the Italian army to fight in Ethiopia. Eloquent and based on authoritative archival research in both Ethiopia and Italy, Campbell’s book sheds new light on a key episode in African history."
25,Salafism and Political Order in Africa,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2022-02-22/salafism-and-political-order-africa,Salafism and Political Order in Africa,"Based on extensive fieldwork in six countries where Salafi Islam has an organized presence (Chad, Kenya, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, and Uganda), Elischer seeks to understand why Salafi organizations get involved in or stay removed from political violence. He argues compellingly that the key mechanism is the relationship between the state and the faithful. Chad, Niger, and Uganda created informal regulatory mechanisms in the immediate post-independence era, prior to the growth of extremist Salafism. As a result, they have largely managed to avoid the emergence of homegrown Salafi violence. Elischer’s impressive case studies show that governments in those places co-opted the Islamic establishment to regulate the building of mosques and the content of sermons at Friday prayers, for instance, and responded to early signs of emerging extremism with the support of local Islamic leaders. On the other hand, Kenya, Mali, and Mauritania complacently ignored the rise of this extremist threat or allowed Islamic groups to organize themselves without state supervision. In these states, Islamist extremism was more likely to emerge and grow in strength before the state could react. Too often, observers assume that the weakness of African states condemns them to impotence; this powerful book suggests otherwise."

As Jerven makes clear, few reliable historical data series go back to the beginning of the colonial period, in the late nineteenth century. Data from the postcolonial era are riddled with missing values for key countries and years. Nevertheless, scholars and analysts still produce confident generalizations about African economic history and its implications for policy. Jerven succeeds in discussing a wide array of methodological issues regarding African data with instructive precision and nuance. He then undertakes some careful combining and massaging of both old and newly available data to create longer and more complete time series of economic data for the region, with a focus on state revenues and the growth of production. His new estimates show that analysts have underestimated the real growth of African economies in the past century and that the deep recession that hit the continent in the 1980s and early 1990s was an exception rather than the rule."
27,A Troubled Birth: The 1930s and American Public Opinion,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2022-02-22/troubled-birth-1930s-and-american-public-opinion,A Troubled Birth: The 1930s and American Public Opinion,"Herbst explores the forces that shape the amorphous thing known as “public opinion,” concerning herself with its quality more than its specific content. Drawing on political science, cultural studies, and media analysis, she concludes that the “astonishingly dark” decade of the 1930s is the most important time for understanding what American public opinion is today. The cultural cauldron of that period saw the catastrophe of the Great Depression, the omnipresence of President Franklin Roosevelt, the swift diffusion of radio (the first national broadcast medium), and the rise of fearsome totalitarianism abroad on the heels of what had seemed like a solid victory in World War I. The brands of populism that arose in the 1930s, along with the racism, anti-intellectualism, and burgeoning consumer culture fueled by the new national media, produced a public that was and remains less engaged and rational than it is able to be “blown around like a feather by professional persuaders.” The art of polling, another product of this decade, wrongly assumes that interviewees share the perspective behind the questions. Herbst describes polling as a “crude, authoritarian and extraordinarily rigid” way to measure public opinion that cannot hope to discern the forces at work. Other, less rigid types of measurement are not much better (the televised focus group “uses the worst of all methods . . . simultaneously”)."
28,Lincoln and the Fight for Peace,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2022-03-22/lincoln-and-fight-peace,Lincoln and the Fight for Peace,"Avlon braves a subject about which thousands of books have already been written by finding a relatively empty niche in the gigantic literature on President Abraham Lincoln, namely the president’s plans for winning the peace after the Civil War. It is a particularly timely subject now in a polarized United States and world. Lincoln wanted to pair an unambiguous military victory—he insisted on the Confederacy’s unconditional surrender—with plans for a magnanimous peace that would emphasize political reconciliation, economic growth, and incremental movement toward racial inclusion. Although those plans were fatally undermined by his chosen successor, Andrew Johnson, Lincoln’s wisdom has influenced successful postwar reconstructions ever since, especially in Germany and Japan after World War II. In his research, Avlon was “struck by how thin the study of peace and postwar stabilization is compared to the study of war” and how much scholarship on these two ends of the same stick needs to be “recalibrated.” His own book underlines this thinness in its comments on current thinking about postwar policies (particularly by making some incorrect statements about U.S. planning for Iraq after the 2003 invasion), but this doesn’t diminish the value of its highly readable, original treatment of Lincoln’s tragically interrupted plans to heal the country."

Although Indyk is lavish in his praise of Kissinger’s wisdom and wiliness, the story he tells exposes Kissinger’s responsibility for many of the subsequent flaws of U.S. diplomacy in the region. As Indyk documents, Kissinger was not really interested in securing peace so much as stabilizing a regional order in which the United States would remain indispensable. The peace process was about the process, not the peace, and judged by this standard, the United States neither aspired to nor failed at “the art of peacemaking.” Moreover, in his enthusiasm for the role of the great figures in history, Kissinger conflated the vision and skills of rulers with the interests and capabilities of their states, creating a reliance on personal diplomacy that has debilitated U.S. policy in the region ever since. Indyk tells this story with style and intelligence, but it is a darker tale than he acknowledges."
30,100% Democracy: The Case for Universal Voting,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2022-02-22/100-democracy-case-universal-voting,100% Democracy: The Case for Universal Voting,"In 2024, when many fear that a complete breakdown of U.S. democracy will occur, Australia will mark the 100th anniversary of its adoption of mandatory universal voting. In this closely argued short volume, Dionne and Rapoport contend that making voting a universal civic duty, as well as a right, could massively strengthen the United States’ troubled democracy. At first, the idea seems fantastical. But the authors methodically lay out a series of philosophical, practical, constitutional, and cultural arguments for it and compellingly describe Australia’s own experience with compulsory voting. The United States would need to start by instituting reforms to make voter registration and voting easily accessible. Those who did not vote would be subject to a minor noncompliance fee, but the First Amendment would be protected by allowing the submission of a blank ballot and the option to vote “none of the above.” Compulsory voting would end the country’s long, sorry history of voter suppression. The massive sums now directed to generating voter turnout would become unnecessary. More attention might be directed to substantive policy issues. The authors acknowledge the cultural hurdle that such a universal civic duty might pose in the United States. They note, however, that rights and duties are closely related. Americans accept the obligations of jury duty, getting a driver’s license, and registering for military service, among others. Voting could just be one more duty among many. The book provides a strong base for beginning a consequential national discussion."

By 2020, the Chinese market accounted for the largest box office in the world. Schwartzel tells the story of how Chinese investments in Hollywood and the Communist Party’s role in deciding what Chinese audiences could see swiftly inverted the power relationship between China and the United States in this immensely influential industry. With the Chinese market “too lucrative to anger,” Hollywood executives learned the troubling art of “anticipatory censorship,” stripping films of anything that might annoy Beijing. In 2010, news that a soon-to-be-released remake of the 1984 hit Red Dawn featured a Chinese invasion of the United States prompted angry editorials in China. Spooked, MGM transformed the already filmed movie into a preposterous story of an invasion by North Korea. Fear of Chinese retaliation against possible blockbusters makes movie executives attentive to Chinese sensibilities down to the potential ramifications of a single shot. Only a studio that has failed to break into the Chinese market, such as Netflix, can retain a degree of freedom to film what it chooses. Schwartzel makes this story of big stars and big money a page-turner, but its implications are much larger. Whose history, whose successes, whose future agenda, and what values—of democracy or authoritarianism—will the world see on the big screen?"

It emerged from the war a towering colossus, by far the world’s greatest military and economic power. Unsurprisingly, then, World War II occupies a special place in the national psyche. Samet, an English professor at West Point and an accomplished author, reviews American literature, film, and culture to convincingly argue that something dangerous has occurred through the false remembrance of the war. Increasingly thick layers of “nostalgia, sentimentality, and jingoism” have produced a profoundly distorted collective memory of the war as it was fought abroad and at home. In turn, this has shaped unwarranted beliefs in American exceptionalism. Mythmaking about World War II blossomed around the war’s 50th anniversary and after the end of the Cold War. Samet’s treatment of the works of the historian Stephen Ambrose and the journalist Tom Brokaw and, to a lesser degree, Steven Spielberg’s Hollywood epic Saving Private Ryan is devastating. Looking ahead, she warns against the abiding power of the “seemingly indestructible fantasy” that U.S. military interventions will “naturally produce” good outcomes, a delusion that continues to prompt the unsuccessful quest for another equally transformational conflict."

There was nothing else like it in the entire city, and this memoir by one of its three founders—all women, itself an indication of the shop’s novelty and ambition—is as original and extraordinary as the store itself. Organized in chapters reflecting the store’s sections, including “Self-Help,” “The Classics,” “Business and Management,” and “Egypt Essentials,” the book weaves stories of doing business in Egypt with tales of the author’s home and family. It is a clear-eyed and often brash account of success and failure, both professional and personal. The ambiguities and contradictions of class in Egypt—who reads books, who can afford books, who steals books, and where one buys books (from the fading storefronts of central Cairo or the glittering malls in the city’s new suburbs)—are explored with frank insight and affection. The sales clerks had their pockets sewn shut to discourage petty theft, but these workers could debate the merits of the writer Naguib Mahfouz’s Nobel Prize."

The British-bred Rashid Rauf orchestrated the attacks from Pakistan. Disappointed that one of the bombs had failed to detonate, he decided to improve the explosives used, eventually devising a plot to bring down passenger aircraft using bottles of liquid hydrogen peroxide disguised as sodas. British intelligence got wind of the plot and began a vast surveillance operation, following the terrorists as they acquired the ingredients for their bombs and filmed their martyrdom videos. One of the most significant aspects of the story is the tension between British officials who wanted to gather evidence to be sure a case against Rauf and his collaborators would stand up in court and their impatient American counterparts, who were keen to move before the plotters launched their attack. The Americans eventually preempted the issue by getting Rauf arrested in Pakistan (he later escaped custody), forcing the British into rushing arrests in the United Kingdom and jeopardizing the trial of the conspirators."

In this lively, absorbing account, Hankins demonstrates the influence of a specific culture that celebrated the fighter pilot as a “knight of the air” who thrilled to aerial combat. This close-knit group, of which Colonel John Boyd became the most prominent member, was uncompromising in its advocacy but was disappointed when the designs for the new aircraft introduced additional technologies and functions. Hankins acknowledges some important contributions from this group, but he sees its purism as a nostalgic yearning for a past form of warfare that glorified the daring individual without appreciating the importance of supporting technologies. Its claims were undermined by the 1990–91 Persian Gulf War, which featured few dogfights but many attack missions on Iraqi ground positions. Technology, not individual bravado, provided the winning edge."

U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt may have been ready to prioritize the fight against Germany, but Japan had attacked the United States, and so there was an argument for concentrating on the Pacific. British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, who later claimed that after the attack on Pearl Harbor he knew at once the war would be won, was actually anxious that the United States would be so distracted by Japan that it would leave the United Kingdom alone, with dwindling material support, to deal with the Nazis. In a detailed reconstruction of the events of those few days, illuminating the importance of confusion, chance, and choice in the stream of history, Simms and Laderman explain that Hitler assumed that war with the United States was inevitable—because the country was supposedly controlled by Jews—and preferred to wage it earlier rather than later, buttressed by supplies of food and oil he hoped to gain by defeating the Soviet Union."

It opens with the authors scrambling to help friends and colleagues who had worked with coalition forces escape the Taliban’s retribution. Kilcullen and Mills know the country and the conflict well, having spent many years between them advising both civilian and military leaders on the war in Afghanistan. They eviscerate the Biden administration for what they see as its betrayal of the people of Afghanistan, but their analysis points to multiple failures spread over the previous two decades. The United States occupied the country in 2001 without any long-term strategy, and the Bush administration soon distracted itself with its invasion of Iraq. The U.S.-led military coalition chased unrealistic goals and misunderstood the enemy and Afghan society and politics. Economic assistance to the Afghan government in Kabul fueled corruption as much as development. Pakistan never abandoned the Taliban. Many of the lessons of the last two decades should have been learned from the U.S. debacle in Vietnam or the Soviet experience in Afghanistan."

Are cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin just tulip bulbs for the twenty-first century, or do they offer investors tangible benefits of diversification and reliable protection against inflation? Will stablecoins significantly reduce the cost of cross-border transactions or just replace local currencies in developing countries, undermining the capacity of their central banks to pursue independent monetary policies? Are digital currencies really a way of enhancing the utility of central bank money and fostering financial inclusion, or are they merely a rear-guard action by central banks to avoid losing control of the payments system to stablecoin providers? Prasad’s answer to all these questions is, in a word, yes. Given the rapidly changing digital landscape, any book-length treatment of these issues risks quickly going out of date. For the moment, however, Prasad’s analysis is the best single point of entry for those interested in the nitty-gritty of digital finance."

Instead, the expansion of Chinese exports following the country’s accession to the WTO in 2001 gave rise to chronic commercial conflict with the United States. Mavroidis and Sapir focus on the problems for the global order created by China’s continued reliance on state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and its policy of forced technology transfer. The country is unlikely, they acknowledge, to significantly modify its economic system in response to foreign pressure. It is doubtful, in particular, that bilateral negotiations with the United States will result in any meaningful reforms. Only multilateral pressure applied through the WTO can ensure that China’s SOEs operate in greater conformity with the market and can encourage the country to strengthen its intellectual property protections. The authors suggest that China should adopt provisions relating to SOEs and intellectual property from the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, the Asia-Pacific’s newly negotiated trade agreement. They argue that Beijing just might agree to subject itself to WTO rules and embrace the liberal spirit of the organization in return for admission into the major regional trade deal."

White is rightly regarded as a central figure in the creation of the twentieth-century global economy, but his reputation has been clouded by accusations that he might have been a Soviet spy, a fellow traveler, or, at the very least, an enabler. Boughton describes White’s early scholarly contributions and rise from academic obscurity. He goes to great lengths to demolish, presumably once and for all, claims that White was disloyal to the United States. He recounts White’s consequential role in the design of the New Deal, in U.S. foreign financial diplomacy in the 1930s, in securing financing for World War II, and in the historic negotiations leading to the establishment of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. White emerges as something of an international economic Forrest Gump, a witness to and a participant in the major events of his time. He finally has the biography he deserves."

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement gained fresh notoriety in the Trump years, but controversy over deportation is not new. President Barack Obama, sometimes referred to by immigrant advocates as “the deporter in chief,” oversaw an enormous expansion of the Secure Communities program, through which federal authorities partnered with local jails to carry out immigration enforcement. The authors interweave scholarly studies with the personal accounts of undocumented workers and their families. Interior immigration enforcement, they show, engenders uncertainty and a sense of vulnerability among the undocumented. Its chilling effect discourages workers from reporting work-site safety problems and seeking health care for themselves and their family members. Watson and Thompson call for a more politically temperate discussion of immigration and conclude with recommendations for a more humane and economically efficient interior enforcement regime."

In this groundbreaking book, Carnegie and Carson show that the story is actually more complicated. In fact, surprisingly, international organizations often work hard to keep secrets. Organizations such as the United Nations, the World Trade Organization, and the International Atomic Energy Agency have stored sensitive information confidentially to better implement peacekeeping missions, combat drug trafficking, enforce sanctions regimes, and address environmental degradation. The authors develop a theory to explain when cooperation is better served through the safeguarding of private information and when it is better served by its disclosure. Having general information about whether particular states uphold commitments is critical for the enforcement of rules and agreements. But the disclosure of some sensitive information can be counterproductive. For instance, publishing satellite photos of a country’s hidden nuclear weapons can lead to greater efforts at concealment. Publishing information regarding the health of a country’s financial sector could lead to an adverse market reaction, compounding the problem. The book explores these complexities in detailed empirical studies in the areas of nuclear proliferation, international trade, and war crimes. The challenge for international organizations is formidable: their legitimacy as intergovernmental bodies hinges on their openness and accountability, but their effectiveness as problem solvers depends in part on their ability to guard secrets."

The book explores this insight through an illuminating account of the rise and fall of the 1970s-era OPEC regime, which demonstrated that although the United States and the other advanced industrial democracies may have dominated and led the global system, they were unable to control the massive wealth-transferring efforts of weak and peripheral oil-exporting states. OPEC eventually declined in influence because it was unable to control the market, although it continued to generate political benefits for its members. In telling this story, Colgan shows how a diverse and unexpected group of states were able to set the terms of the order within a specific functional setting, at least for a little while. The larger contribution of the book is to complicate received notions of U.S. hegemony and the liberal international order, which, according to Colgan, miss the political agency of weaker actors, such as oil-exporting developing countries, and the ideologies behind and movements for decolonization and self-determination. If Colgan is right, great powers may have less control over the global system than they assume."

Long live liberalism. That is the implicit message of this passionate call for a “new politics” in the liberal democratic world. Pabst, a leading thinker of the culturally conservative British “Blue Labour” movement, offers a searing indictment of pandemic-era liberal capitalist societies that are home to soaring wealth inequality, social misery, polarization, and the breakdown of civic culture. He argues that neither liberalism, nor populism, nor authoritarianism can adequately grapple with the deterioration of modern industrial societies. The only viable way forward, he claims, is the invention of a postliberal politics that combines democracy with a new spirit of localism and shared community. The book offers glimmers of what a “postliberal space” might entail, providing ideas on how to build new coalitions to “reweave” liberal society. Fundamentally, Pabst wants to retrieve national and community-level control of the economy and society from the dynamics of globalization and the neoliberal organization of the world economy. He seeks a rebalancing of liberal society in which its excessive emphasis on individualism and impersonal market forces are replaced with a more communitarian politics that focuses on repairing civic and cultural ties and renewing traditions of toleration and respect."

Machine learning has already begun to change human society, for good and ill. Computers that can perform tasks that require human-level intelligence are finding their way into more and more spheres of life, including medicine, environmental protection, transportation, and defense. The authors argue that AI will have sweeping implications for militaries, altering doctrines and battle tactics and influencing the global balance of power. Equally important will be how dictators and other leaders use AI to shape the “information space” at home and abroad. The authors argue that AI’s most profound impact will be in the mysterious ways that machines gain access to aspects of reality that are beyond the understanding of humans, subtly altering our Enlightenment-era understanding of human reason, knowledge, and choice. In a world where machines are smarter than people, what does it actually mean to be human? The book asks more questions than it answers. But that is its point: to provoke a wide-ranging conversation about how societies can make AI a partner in—rather than an obstacle to—the pursuit of human betterment."

Over the course of a few months, Alexander Lukashenko, the authoritarian leader of Belarus, enticed thousands of migrants and would-be asylum seekers, primarily Kurds from Iraq and Syria, as well as some Afghans, to his country with promises of easy access to the European Union. Flown into the capital, Minsk, on special visas, they were bused to Belarus’s western border, where they were left in large, unprotected encampments as winter approached and temperatures plunged. Despite EU legislation and UN treaties guaranteeing humanitarian protections for asylum seekers, border guards from Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland pushed those attempting to enter their countries back into Belarus, employing tear gas, water cannons, and rubber bullets. In orchestrating a televised humanitarian crisis on the EU’s doorstep, Lukashenko produced a major headache for European policymakers. Although the Belarusian leader’s motivations remain opaque, a key objective appears to have been to discomfit, humiliate, and sow division within the EU for failing to recognize him as the legitimate winner of the flawed 2020 Belarusian presidential election and for imposing sanctions on his country after he brutally suppressed the pro-democracy protests that followed."

The UAE had never formally recognized Israel, and Bahrain had held off on opening an embassy there. In the not-too-distant past, both countries had boycotted Israel. But all three states had come together to move beyond this frosty history by signing the U.S.-brokered Abraham Accords, in which they agreed to establish normal diplomatic relations."
49,Before the Next Shock,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/world/2022-02-22/next-shock,Before the Next Shock,"During the coming decade, the world economy will confront a crisis. This forecast may sound rash, but the past half century revealed that disasters occur regularly. In recent times, policymakers have faced not just the COVID-19 pandemic and its economic trauma but also various eurozone crises. These dramas followed the global financial crisis of 2008 and the consequent recession, which were in turn preceded by the shock of 9/11. Before the terrorist attacks of that day, the world had coped with the Internet boom and bust at the turn of the millennium; the exchange-rate and debt travails of Russia, East Asia, and Latin America in the late 1990s; painful economic adjustments at the end of the Cold War; developing-country defaults in the 1980s following the petrodollar lending splurge of the 1970s; and stagflation. Crises have been the historical norm, not the exception."
50,Lost at Sea,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/review-essay/2022-02-22/lost-sea,Lost at Sea,"In 1897, the British Parliament pressed George Goschen, first lord of the Admiralty, about the potential maritime threat posed by a deepening alliance of continental European powers. Asked what the United Kingdom would do if it were confronted by multiple European navies at sea, Goschen replied, “Trust in Providence and a good Admiral.” In other words, the United Kingdom had no good answer for a challenge of that magnitude."
51,Spin Dictators: The Changing Face of Tyranny in the 21st Century,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2022-02-22/spin-dictators-changing-face-tyranny-21st-century,Spin Dictators: The Changing Face of Tyranny in the 21st Century,"Guriev and Treisman offer a deeply researched tour d’horizon of the evolving dark arts of authoritarian politics. The old model of dictatorship was embodied in the violence and brutality of Stalin’s Soviet Union and Mao’s China, regimes built on coercion, fear, and the gulag. Authoritarianism today manifests in the “low-intensity coercion” of regimes on both the left and the right, exemplified by the governments of Hungary, Russia, Singapore, Turkey, and Venezuela. The goal of dictatorship remains the same: dominance and control over society. But the method of the new breed of autocrats is not to be feared but to become popular through the control and manipulation of information. They wrap their regimes in the symbols and rhetoric of democracy, while using the powers of the state to incrementally weaken and silence opposition. The new dictatorships are harder to combat because they tend to operate within the framework of constitutional and parliamentary systems. But the good news is that these regimes are also vulnerable to push back from antiauthoritarian actors: lawyers, judges, civil servants, activists, and journalists."
52,The Allies Are Alright,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2022-02-22/allies-are-alright,The Allies Are Alright,"The presidency of Donald Trump seemed to throw the U.S. alliance system into disarray. In 2016, when still a candidate, Trump disparaged Washington’s traditional allies, dismissed NATO as “obsolete,” and claimed that maintaining military and financial commitments in Europe and elsewhere was “bankrupting” the United States. This tough rhetoric continued during his administration. After his withdrawal from a host of international accords, including the Paris climate agreement and the Iran nuclear deal, it seemed possible that Trump would also fail to fulfill long-standing commitments to U.S. allies in Europe and East Asia. The U.S. foreign policy establishment feared that the alliances underpinning the so-called liberal international order were in jeopardy."
53,Iran’s Hollow Victory,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/iran/2022-02-16/irans-hollow-victory,Iran’s Hollow Victory,"Few countries have maintained clearer or more consistent aspirations over the last four decades than the Islamic Republic of Iran. Since 1979, when Islamic revolutionaries transformed the country from an U.S.-allied monarchy into an ardently anti-American theocracy, Iran has sought to expel the United States from the Middle East, replace Israel with Palestine, and remake the region in its image. Unlike U.S. strategy toward Iran and the greater Middle East, which has shifted markedly with different administrations, Iranian strategy toward the United States and the Middle East has exhibited remarkable continuity. Tehran has not achieved any of its lofty ambitions, but it has made progress toward them—and it is feeling emboldened by its recent successes."
54,The Dictator’s New Playbook,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/world/2022-02-22/dictators-new-playbook,The Dictator’s New Playbook,"Around the world, from the richest countries to the poorest, a dangerous new crop of leaders has sprung up. Unlike their totalitarian counterparts, these populists entered office through elections, but they show decidedly undemocratic proclivities. They propagate lies that become articles of faith among their followers. They sell themselves as noble and pure champions of the people, fighting against corrupt and greedy elites. They defy any constraints on their power and concentrate it in their own hands, launching frontal attacks on the institutions that sustain constitutional democracy, stacking the judiciary and the legislature, declaring war on the press, and scrapping laws that check their authority."
55,Scorched Earth,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/middle-east/2022-02-22/scorched-earth,Scorched Earth,"Of all the regions of the world that will face severe devastation as a result of global warming, perhaps none seems poised to suffer as much as the Middle East, already the planet’s hottest and driest. Between 1961 and 1990, temperatures in the Middle East and North Africa rose by 0.2 degrees Celsius, and they could increase by up to seven degrees Celsius by the end of this century. The signs of distress are growing by the year, with normal weather patterns being replaced by chaotic events. In 2020, flooding ravaged Egypt, Iran, and Tunisia, and wildfires spread in Lebanon, Syria, and Turkey. The summer of 2021 brought Iraq’s worst drought in 40 years and Syria’s worst in 70."
56,The Middle East Moves On,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/issue-packages/2022-02-22/middle-east-moves,In Search of a Post-American Order,"In the wake of the 9/11 attacks and the U.S. invasion of Iraq, President George W. Bush announced a “forward strategy of freedom in the Middle East,” driven by American “energy and idealism.” A few years after that, President Barack Obama proclaimed a hopeful “new beginning” for U.S. Middle East policy and later hailed the Arab uprisings as “a chance to pursue the world as it should be,” after “decades of accepting the world as it is in the region.” But it didn’t take long for the grand pronouncements to collide with harsh reality—leaving U.S. policymakers scrambling ever since to walk back such commitments without making things even worse."
57,Enemies of My Enemy,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/china/new-world-order-enemies-my-enemy-china,Enemies of My Enemy,"The international order is falling apart, and everyone seems to know how to fix it. According to some, the United States just needs to rededicate itself to leading the liberal order it helped found some 75 years ago. Others argue that the world’s great powers should form a concert to guide the international community into a new age of multipolar cooperation. Still others call for a grand bargain that divides the globe into stable spheres of influence. What these and other visions of international order have in common is an assumption that global governance can be designed and imposed from the top down. With wise statesmanship and ample summitry, the international jungle can be tamed and cultivated. Conflicts of interest and historical hatreds can be negotiated away and replaced with win-win cooperation."

59,Why Democracy Stalled in the Middle East,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/middle-east/2022-02-22/why-democracy-stalled-middle-east,Why Democracy Stalled in the Middle East,"In 2011, citizens across the Middle East took to the streets to demand more representative governments, social justice, and economic reforms. In Egypt and Tunisia, protest movements toppled dictators who had ruled for decades; authoritarian regimes elsewhere in the region were rattled as never before. The Arab Spring captured imaginations around the world and challenged long-held assumptions about the region’s political culture."

61,The War on Free Speech,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/world/2022-02-09/war-free-speech-censorship,The War on Free Speech,"The roots of free speech are ancient, deep, and sprawling. The Athenian statesman Pericles extolled the democratic values of open debate and tolerance of social dissent in 431 BC. In the ninth century, the irreverent freethinker Ibn al-Rawandi used the fertile intellectual climate of the Abbasid caliphate to question prophecy and holy books. In 1582, the Dutchman Dirck Coornhert insisted that it was “tyrannical to . . . forbid good books in order to squelch the truth.” The first legal protection of press freedom was instituted in Sweden in 1766. In 1770, Denmark became the first state in the world to abolish any and all censorship."
62,The Price of Order,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/middle-east/price-order,The Price of Order,"There is no question that the Middle East is a mess. The usual explanations for the disarray, however, fail to capture the root cause. Sectarianism, popular discontent with unrepresentative governments, economic failure, and foreign interference are the usual suspects in most analyses, but they are symptoms of the regional crisis, not causes. The weakness, and in some cases collapse, of central authority in so many of the region’s states is the real source of its current disorder. The civil wars in Libya, Syria, and Yemen, along with the frail governments in Iraq, Lebanon, and the quasi state of Palestine, define the long-term geopolitical challenge of the region. These political vacuums invite the intervention of powers near and far. They allow sectarian and ethnic identities to become more salient. They give terrorist groups opportunities for growth. They impede economic development. And they create profound human suffering, which leads to massive refugee flows."
63,Revenge of the Patriarchs,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2022-02-08/women-rights-revenge-patriarchs,Revenge of the Patriarchs,"The pantheon of autocratic leaders includes a great many sexists, from Napoléon Bonaparte, who decriminalized the murder of unfaithful wives, to Benito Mussolini, who claimed that women “never created anything.” And while the twentieth century saw improvements in women’s equality in most parts of the world, the twenty-first is demonstrating that misogyny and authoritarianism are not just common comorbidities but mutually reinforcing ills. Throughout the last century, women’s movements won the right to vote for women; expanded women’s access to reproductive health care, education, and economic opportunity; and began to enshrine gender equality in domestic and international law—victories that corresponded with unprecedented waves of democratization in the postwar period. Yet in recent years, authoritarian leaders have launched a simultaneous assault on women’s rights and democracy that threatens to roll back decades of progress on both fronts."

The authors sketch the party’s leadership, including its charismatic co-founder the tycoon Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit; its progressive ideological platform; and its supporters. Quietly simmering under the narrative are concerns about whether the movement can be revived and whether it represented a new kind of party or merely put a new spin on a conventional model centered on high profile, charismatic leaders. The authors highlight a generational divide underlying recent protests in Thailand: digitally savvy youth with global worldviews do not share the values of older generations, which remain loyal to the monarchy and the social hierarchy underpinning it. Future Forward’s political platform—advanced in large part on social media—appealed to younger generations because it advocated values such as inclusivity, diversity, and opposition to hierarchy. Although the book argues that Internet platforms are crucial to progressive politics in Thailand, it is less successful in explaining what this means in a country where virtually everyone, including conservative royalists, is active on social media."
1,Two Books on Taiwan,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-04-20/two-books-taiwan,Two Books on Taiwan,"Understanding Taiwan is more important today than ever before, given rising U.S.-Chinese tensions and great-power rivalry. But Taiwan is more than an international hot spot. It is also relevant because although it has emerged from the pandemic as one of the most resilient democracies, with an effective public health system and a stellar economy, it is grappling with difficult long-term problems that are also plaguing other high-income societies."
2,"Dialect and Nationalism in China, 1860–1960",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-04-20/dialect-and-nationalism-china-1860-1960,"Dialect and Nationalism in China, 1860–1960","Chinese nationalists who wanted to create a modern nation in the twentieth century had to contend with the dozens of regional forms of spoken Chinese, which they believed hindered the creation of a unified culture. Tam argues that these speech forms are not just dialects but distinct languages, as different from one another as many of the languages spoken in Europe. To solve the problem, modernizers designed a common language based on the vocabulary and pronunciation found in Beijing and claimed that the regional languages were mere offshoots of this main idiom. Mao Zedong’s regime forced all Han people to learn the common language. But folklorists, anthropologists, dramatists and, in the post-Mao period, rap artists believed the local forms of speech expressed the authentic culture of the common people. In this learned and thoughtful study, Tam shows that local languages have survived in the face of state hostility, mostly because people continue to speak them with their children and neighbors. The struggle over uniformity versus diversity continues with the current regime’s efforts to snuff out Tibetan, Uyghur, and other languages of the non-Han minorities."
3,China’s Quest for Foreign Technology: Beyond Espionage,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-04-20/chinas-quest-foreign-technology-beyond-espionage,China’s Quest for Foreign Technology: Beyond Espionage,"A 2013 book by Hannas and two other contributors to the present volume focused on the many ways that China gets hold of advanced U.S. technology. Since then, as reported by contributors to this new, deeply researched and sophisticated volume, the Chinese government has vastly increased its technology-acquisition programs, not only in the United States but also in Australia, Japan, South Korea, and Europe. As before, some Chinese methods are illegal, such as hacking and theft, but many are carried out in the open, including investing in foreign companies, conducting joint research projects with foreign universities and companies, using “talent programs” to bring Chinese and non-Chinese scientists to China, and offering returned scholars venture capital to start businesses. Thousands of university centers, technology-transfer parks, and startup incubators convert the imported technology into products that increase China’s competitiveness, upgrade its military, or strengthen the government’s ability to control society. Officials and observers in the West lack awareness of the extent of these activities. Governments face the dilemma of trying to stop the outflow of advanced technology without interrupting the valuable inflow of Chinese students and scholars."
4,Bombay Brokers,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-04-20/bombay-brokers,Bombay Brokers,"This collection of 36 short profiles by as many authors affectionately portrays the middlemen and facilitators who grease the wheels of life in Mumbai (formerly known as Bombay) in imaginative ways. There is the construction engineer who specializes in persuading municipal officers to approve water hookups for buildings that are not certified for occupancy; the retired municipal official who uses his connections to help neighbors with identity cards, rubbish removal, and death certificates; and a variety of entrepreneurs who specialize in assembling political crowds with money or entertainment. Some of the subjects are like those who run small businesses anywhere, but with an Indian twist: a messenger who specializes in delivering daily lunchboxes from homes to office workers through Mumbai’s impossible transit system, a group of transgender women who collect overdue loans by dancing in front of deadbeats until they pay, a “prison master” who serves other people’s terms. The characters in the book maneuver in the ambiguous spaces between the modern political economy and the tangled reality of irrational regulations, strained resources, and too many people. The book is an unconventional introduction to India’s biggest city and an invitation to the joys and challenges of ethnography."
5,To Kill a Democracy: India’s Passage to Despotism,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-04-20/kill-democracy-indias-passage-despotism,To Kill a Democracy: India’s Passage to Despotism,"A combination of investigative reporting and political theory, this probing book argues that “social death” is the reason for the decline of democracy, with India offered as a case study. The authors detail India’s broken health-care system, chronic hunger, land grabs, air and water pollution, dysfunctional public transport networks, religious bigotry, pervasive illiteracy, debt bondage, child slavery, and mistreatment of women. As people come to accept deep social and economic inequality, the system erodes the dignity of its citizens—the principle on which democracy depends. That social breakdown produces hordes of cynical young people ready to join authoritarian militias and political movements, dynastic parties run by corrupt politicians, captive media, dysfunctional legislatures, subservient security agencies, and partisan courts. Elections, marred by violence and money politics, become exercises in “voluntary servitude.” Chowdhury and Keane say these problems started long before Narendra Modi became prime minister in 2014 and have grown worse under his leadership. One wonders, however, whether to blame social ills for democratic decline or the reverse."

He reviews 500 years of history to make this case. Farmer always writes with great passion, but as a medical doctor by training with much experience in African countries, he is particularly authoritative about the issues Ebola posed for medical staff. His book argues that a “control-over-care” ideology permeates the region to the present day, as a legacy of the colonial emphasis on the containment of diseases rather than the treatment of the afflicted. During the Ebola outbreak in West Africa in 2014, this logic of control meant that the main strategy to address the epidemic was to isolate infected individuals and the communities where the virus had spread, rather than to try to care for the infected. Farmer argues that as a result, many Africans died needlessly, despite widely available treatments."
7,"East Africa After Liberation: Conflict, Security, and the State Since the 1980s",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-04-20/east-africa-after-liberation-conflict-security-and-state-1980s,"East Africa After Liberation: Conflict, Security, and the State Since the 1980s","Fisher’s excellent political history focuses on the countries in East Africa where the current regimes came to power through successful insurgencies decades ago. His book links the fates of Ethiopia, Eritrea, Rwanda, and Uganda and describes the impact of the many links that leaders in the four countries forged before their rises to power. Ethiopian insurgents had fought side by side with their Eritrean counterparts to oust the regime of Ethiopian President Mengistu Haile Mariam in 1991. The Rwandan rebels who attained power in 1994 had helped Ugandan fighters come to power a decade earlier. Fisher shows convincingly that all four regimes came to share similar concerns about regional security, and they all opposed conservative regimes in the region, most notably the government of Mobutu Sese Seko in Zaire. Still, the personal bonds that linked the leaderships in the four countries frayed considerably over time, as their respective countries’ national interests diverged and their ambitions led them to view one another with suspicion. Fisher concludes gloomily that these former insurgents have retained their propensity to use violence as a political instrument to deal with their foreign policy problems, with potentially destabilizing outcomes in the future for East Africa."
8,The Asian Aspiration: Why and How Africa Should Emulate Asia—and What It Should Avoid,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-04-20/asian-aspiration-why-and-how-africa-should-emulate-asia-and-what,The Asian Aspiration: Why and How Africa Should Emulate Asia—and What It Should Avoid,"Unlike most of the recent books vaunting the economic success of East Asia relative to Africa, this one does not limit its Asian examples to China, South Korea, and Taiwan; the authors also discuss poorer countries, such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and Vietnam, whose history and past economic policy failures make their recent successes more instructive for African countries. The authors review the record of private-sector, export-led growth in ten Asian countries and distill lessons for African states. Governments, they argue, should seek to create inclusive leadership, improve their countries’ educational systems, invest in infrastructure, and open up their economies to foreign direct investment. These reasonable prescriptions are not new, but they might nonetheless be considered controversial among too many African elites. The authors recognize that there isn’t a one-size-fits-all solution; the particular strategy and sequence of reforms will vary in each country. They also argue explicitly that Africa should diverge from the Asian example by avoiding the authoritarian proclivities of many Asian countries and by ensuring that economic growth doesn’t lead to tremendous environmental destruction."
9,Amakomiti: Grassroots Democracy in South African Shack Settlements,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-04-20/amakomiti-grassroots-democracy-south-african-shack-settlements,Amakomiti: Grassroots Democracy in South African Shack Settlements,"Based on ethnographic fieldwork in some 46 of South Africa’s informal urban settlements, Ngwane’s probing study focuses on local governance structures called amakomiti, the Zulu word for “committee.” All but one of these settlements maintained at least one community-run committee, which was more or less responsive to popular needs and served as an intermediary between the local population and formal state structures, helping ensure the delivery of key services such as clean water and electricity. At their best, these local committees clearly improved people’s lives. Ngwane describes them as inclusive and democratic but actually says little about how they chose leaders or about the level of political participation in the neighborhoods. Some of his most trenchant analysis concerns the interaction of the committees and the African National Congress, the only political party that appears to have a significant political presence in the settlements. But Ngwane found that the ANC played a meaningful role in only roughly one in six communities. Although the ANC still garners a good deal of legitimacy from its historic part in the struggle against apartheid, Ngwane’s respondents mostly viewed the ANC as indifferent to their welfare, even as the party seeks their votes."
10,In the Forest of No Joy: The Congo-Océan Railroad and the Tragedy of French Colonialism,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-04-20/forest-no-joy-congo-ocean-railroad-and-tragedy-french-colonialism,In the Forest of No Joy: The Congo-Océan Railroad and the Tragedy of French Colonialism,"The Congo-Océan Railroad today links the Atlantic Ocean to Brazzaville, the capital of the Republic of the Congo, a distance of 312 miles through thick rainforest and steep terrain. Built at great human cost by the French colonial administration between 1921 and 1934, it has long been viewed as emblematic of the murderous cruelty of colonialism in Africa. Daughton’s accessible history of its construction discusses how French authorities used forced conscription—with ridiculously low wages—to find the necessary labor for the railroad. The awful working conditions led to between 15,000 and 60,000 deaths. But the railroad never came close to realizing the economic and financial objectives bandied about by its supporters. Relying on journalistic accounts from the period and the excellent use of archival materials, his book paints a vivid picture of colonialism in central Africa: the vast and sparsely populated terrain with virtually no communications infrastructure, the petty racism of the handful of colonial officials on the ground, and the bureaucratic delusions and highflying patriotic rhetoric of a poorly informed government back in Paris."
11,"The Egyptian Coffeehouse: Culture, Politics, and Urban Space",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-04-20/egyptian-coffeehouse-culture-politics-and-urban-space,"The Egyptian Coffeehouse: Culture, Politics, and Urban Space","The appearance of the coffeehouse in the Middle East in the late Middle Ages appears to have coincided with, and probably fostered, the development of Arab folk epics, such as The Thousand and One Nights. Regular patrons eagerly anticipated the storyteller’s next installment, much as readers of popular magazines in Victorian England consumed famous serialized novels. Since then, Cairo’s cafés have continued to be gathering places for the cultural elite of the day, much like their Parisian counterparts, often serving particular literary coteries and political cliques, as this lively and provocative volume illustrates. Today, as testimonies from a variety of contemporary coffeehouse patrons show, Egyptians of many ages and classes find solace, refuge, conviviality, and job leads at the local café. Everyday political and social change also takes place in the café: since the uprising of 2011, many more coffeehouses welcome women. Starbucks and local chains such as Beano’s may prevail in Cairo’s suburban malls, but they will never beat the wooden chairs, uneven floor, and tiny glasses at Fishawi’s for debating last night’s soccer match—or government decree—with friends."
12,Syrian Requiem: The Civil War and Its Aftermath,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-04-20/syrian-requiem-civil-war-and-its-aftermath,Syrian Requiem: The Civil War and Its Aftermath,"Despite their book’s ominous title, Rabinovich and Valensi don’t actually think Syria—or even its current regime—is dead. In fact, they seem impressed by the staying power of both the country and its government, given the many attempts to bring the regime of Bashar al-Assad down and pull Syria apart over the last decade. In tracing this unexpected resilience, the authors have produced a very useful primer on an astonishingly complex history. An efficient summary of the rule of Assad’s Baath Party sets the stage for an examination of the 2011 uprising and the subsequent civil war through 2018. The authors examine the roles of domestic, regional, and international actors, before attempting to conclude what is in truth an unfinished story by chronicling the events of 2019 and 2020. They are damning in describing what they charitably call the “fluctuations” of an inconsistent U.S. policy on Syria in the past decade. And they supply dizzying accounts of the raucous geopolitical square dance—with regional actors changing partners in Syria with abandon—that has left millions of Syrians dead, displaced, or exiled. Their treatment of Israel’s interests and activities in Syria is predictably astute. In a surprisingly moving section, they discuss the devastation of what was once a robust and lively arts scene in pre-uprising Damascus."
13,Global Jihad: A Brief History,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-04-20/global-jihad-brief-history,Global Jihad: A Brief History,"How has jihad, a Muslim religious imperative to struggle in the path of God, come to preoccupy governments around the world? Robinson provides a synthetic and remarkably comprehensive account of the evolution of political jihad since it came to global prominence in the 1980s. He sketches four waves of jihadi activity: the international call to expel the Soviets from Afghanistan during the 1980s, the anti-American focus of Osama bin Laden and al Qaeda, the rejection by the so-called Islamic State (or ISIS) of the international system, and the proliferation of “lone wolf” actions fueled by radicalization on the Internet. Robinson provides both an accessible history and a provocative analysis of one of the most important political movements in the world over the last half century. Wading into controversial debates, he makes the case that jihadi activity is best understood as a “movement of rage,” an apocalyptic rejection of the secular, scientific knowledge of the Enlightenment, echoing the actions of the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia and many other violent, book-burning mobs. What jihadi leaders have added to this mix, he argues, is the ability to project their rage and unleash their movement on a global scale."
14,"The Power of Deserts: Climate Change,  the Middle East, and the Promise of a  Post-Oil Era",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-04-20/power-deserts-climate-change-middle-east-and-promise-post-oil-era,"The Power of Deserts: Climate Change,  the Middle East, and the Promise of a  Post-Oil Era","Rabinowitz examines the exceptional vulnerability of most of the Middle East to climate change. Temperatures have risen and rainfall declined perceptibly in recent decades in what is already one of the most arid regions of the world. Well before the last decade’s political uprisings, long droughts contributed to significant population displacements and growing political discontent in Sudan and Syria. Virtually all the countries of the region are confronting dwindling rains, shrinking arable land, and rising sea levels. An Israeli sociologist and environmental activist, Rabinowitz persuasively argues that understanding the Middle East without factoring in climate change is “no longer tenable.” Although his political analysis is not always subtle or nuanced, his conclusions are powerful, and surprisingly hopeful: precisely those countries that have the most to lose in a post-oil future—the oil producers of the Arabian Peninsula (and, it might be added, North Africa)—are also well placed to embrace renewable energy, as beneficiaries of strong and reliable sunshine."
15,Three Publications on Counternarcotics Policy in the Americas,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-04-20/three-publications-counternarcotics-policy-americas,Three Publications on Counternarcotics Policy in the Americas,The United States’ five-decade-long “war on drugs” has failed miserably and has caused tremendous collateral damage. But no consensus has emerged on a better path forward. Three recent publications sketch the dimensions of the crisis. A congressionally mandated bipartisan commission endorses many of the basic thrusts of existing U.S. counternarcotics policies. Crandall condemns the devastation that the U.S.-led drug wars have caused in beleaguered countries in Latin America. Andreas sees drug consumption as inherent to the human condition.

The numbers are staggering, but the plumbing of globalization—maritime trade, logistics, and the shipping of hydrocarbons—is often hidden, as Khalili puts it, “behind veils of security and bureaucracy.” She has burrowed into archives, traveled on container ships, pored over statistical data and engineering reports, and talked to oil executives and port managers, stevedores and labor activists in several Persian Gulf ports. The result is a fascinating if, as she acknowledges, “untidy” book. It is a richly revealing portrait of a complex industry that mingles both astonishingly archaic practices—routes plotted on paper charts, for instance, and port laborers locked in work camps—and dazzling technological triumphs. The uncertain boundaries between civilian and military transport, the complex way ships’ registries work, and the shifting ties between governments and industry are, like sea-lanes themselves, difficult to pin down but important to chart, and Khalili provides a valuable window into this world."
17,Assignment Moscow: Reporting on Russia From Lenin to Putin,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-04-20/assignment-moscow-reporting-russia-lenin-putin,Assignment Moscow: Reporting on Russia From Lenin to Putin,"Rodgers, a British journalist who has worked in Russia at various times since the 1990s, writes about the plight of the English-speaking correspondents who have covered Russia, going all the way back to the Russian Revolution in 1917. That their task was not easy is hardly surprising, yet Rodgers repeatedly emphasizes the difficulties they faced (the word “difficult” is used to describe their job at least two dozen times): strict censorship (foreign journalists were forced to clear their dispatches with Soviet authorities until 1961), travel restrictions, limited access to senior officials and ordinary people alike, and the government’s suspicion that Anglo-American correspondents were spies in disguise. Even Rodgers’s discussion of the American journalist Hedrick Smith—who, despite the restrictions, famously managed to produce exceptionally rich and insightful coverage of the Soviet Union and its people in the 1970s—is reduced to Smith’s reflections on how difficult his work was. Rodgers’s narrative rests on an enormous number of articles in Anglo-American media, books by and about journalists, and his own interviews with many Moscow correspondents. He quotes some of them as saying that journalists knew and understood Russia better than diplomats or policymakers did. This may or may not be true. Unfortunately, Rodgers doesn’t give the diplomats and policymakers a chance to respond."
18,“Mafalda”: A Social and Political History of Latin America’s Global Comic,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-04-20/mafalda-social-and-political-history-latin-americas-global-comic,“Mafalda”: A Social and Political History of Latin America’s Global Comic,"The social historian Cosse interprets the famous Argentine comic-strip character Mafalda as a vehicle for its author, Joaquín Salvador Lavado (who passed away last year and whose pen name was Quino), to explore the tribulations of the middle class in Buenos Aires in the turbulent 1960s and early 1970s. Channeling the Peanuts comic strip, Mafalda is an intellectually precious, rebellious tomboy who regularly confronts her rather bewildered parents, questioning traditional social hierarchies and gender roles. Mafalda has friends who variously embody conservative family values and the values of materialistic, upwardly mobile immigrants. Smartly sarcastic, Mafalda comments on the chaos of world affairs and, more specifically, the authoritarianism and violence in Argentina that by the mid-1970s drove her creator into exile. Mafalda was widely disseminated throughout the Spanish-speaking world and beyond; Cosse attributes the comic strip’s enduring popularity to its universal, humanistic humor and to the utopian nostalgia evoked by allusions to the hopeful, youthful 1960s. In explaining Malfalda’s relative obscurity in the United States, Cosse suggests that the cartoon’s social commentaries are too subtle for many American readers."
19,Weak Strongman: The Limits of Power in Putin’s Russia,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-04-20/weak-strongman-limits-power-putins-russia,Weak Strongman: The Limits of Power in Putin’s Russia,"The prevailing narrative about Russia, Frye writes, is overpoliticized and oversimplified. All too often, outside observers reduce Russian politics either to “Putinism,” defined by the character and background of Russian President Vladimir Putin, or to Russia’s unique history and culture. They neglect the numerous comparative studies that portray Russia as a personalist autocracy with much in common with other contemporary regimes in Hungary, Turkey, or Venezuela. Standard political commentary on Russia also gives little importance to dynamics within Russian society. But survey-based academic research—including Frye’s own—illustrates the impact of Russian public opinion on the Kremlin’s decision-making process. Frye seeks to show how the Kremlin’s actions are the result of countless tradeoffs and difficult choices, rather than the expression of an omnipotent ruler’s whims or an insuperable historical legacy. The book makes sophisticated social science accessible to a broad audience. It seems especially timely, too, as Russia’s rising public discontent, economic decline, and confrontation with the West are heightening the dilemmas facing the Kremlin."

In the 1950s, he famously informed the Soviet Union of a secret tunnel the Americans and the British had dug under the Soviet sector of Berlin to tap the communications of the Soviet military. By his own account, he revealed the identities of hundreds of British agents operating in communist countries, leading, in some cases, to their executions. Blake was exposed and tried in the United Kingdom in the 1960s, but he fled from jail using a rope ladder and then made a remarkable escape: a former fellow inmate drove Blake huddled under the back seat of a car all the way to East Germany. Blake reached Moscow in 1967 and lived there until his death in 2020 at the age of 98. Kuper, who interviewed the double agent in 2012, claims that Blake felt no remorse for his actions. Besides his own long interview, Kuper draws on numerous published sources, including Blake’s autobiography and his lectures to security service members in East Germany (where Blake always enjoyed a warm welcome). The MI6 has never made public its files on Blake—perhaps because, as Kuper writes, “his case was so embarrassing to the service.”"
21,A Short History of Russia: From the Pagans to Putin,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-04-20/short-history-russia-pagans-putin,A Short History of Russia: From the Pagans to Putin,"Galeotti skips through Russia’s centuries-long history in around two hundred pages by focusing on its successive rulers. He covers many early princes, along with every tsar and every Communist Party general secretary. The book traces feuds, wars, territorial expansions, and Russian leaders’ repeated attempts to modernize their country while keeping their subjects under tight control, but it does not have much to say about those subjects. Readers will also not find much about Russia’s social structure, ethnic composition, high and popular cultures, systems of education, or faiths. Galeotti intends his book for a broad audience, and his narrative is, indeed, lively and easy to follow. The chapter on Vladimir Putin is brilliant. But a number of unfortunate inaccuracies risk misleading a curious reader. For instance, the invention of the Cyrillic script used for the Russian language is wrongly ascribed to the Byzantine missionaries Cyril and Methodius—they invented Glagolitic, an earlier script quite different from Cyrillic. It is not true that “Byzantine Christianity did not require submission to a distant spiritual leader”: during its first 600 years, the Russian Orthodox Church had its head appointed by the patriarch of Constantinople. And not “most” surveyed Russians, but only one-third, agreed to identify themselves as “Europeans,” a number that dropped even lower in a poll this year."

But by the late 1930s, this policy gave way to boosting the so-called titular nations in the Soviet Union’s constituent republics (titular groups were those that shared their republic’s name, such as Uzbeks in Uzbekistan)—at the expense of nontitular minorities. Goff’s deep and innovative analysis traces the way Soviet policies on nationality affected the population of Soviet Azerbaijan, home to both titular Azeris and many nontitular minorities. Azeris may have felt underprivileged within the context of the hegemony of Russian language and culture in the Soviet Union, but as the titular nation in Azerbaijan, they were privileged over their republic’s nontitular groups. Nontitular minorities found access to education and career advancement severely limited unless they identified as part of titular groups, a dynamic that led to forced assimilation. For example, the number of people claiming to belong to the Talysh minority group in Azerbaijan plummeted from 87,510 to just 85 between the censuses of 1939 and 1959. The last Soviet census, in 1989, reflected a softer political environment that encouraged the Talysh to reassert their identity: their number in the republic jumped up to 21,169. But in today’s Azerbaijan, this entire subject is considered highly sensitive, and mere academic interest in it can attract the ire of the government."

Chiquita sought to open European markets to its bananas, grown elsewhere in Latin America. In this well-documented polemic, Bernal, who was Jamaica’s ambassador to the United States at the time, argues that Chiquita’s lavish donations to U.S. politicians shaped U.S. policymaking: Why else would the U.S. government take up Chiquita’s cause, since the United States itself grew few bananas? Bernal recognizes but downplays other drivers of U.S. policy, such as the distaste for colonial-era trade preferences and the competing interests of Latin American banana exporters. U.S. policymakers also worried that the Caribbean countries would avoid developing new export-oriented industries so long as they could rely on bananas. But the Clinton administration’s efforts on behalf of Chiquita had real consequences. The banana industries of the eastern Caribbean collapsed, and as Bernal warned, drug trafficking increased. In the years since, some of the islands, less confident of U.S. support, have embraced Chinese trade and development offerings. Bernal faults the United States for not giving more weight to its national security interests in these small, vulnerable island economies."
24,The Inclusionary Turn in Latin American Democracies,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-04-20/inclusionary-turn-latin-american-democracies,The Inclusionary Turn in Latin American Democracies,"In this first-rate collection of scholarly essays, leading political scientists celebrate the progress that many Latin American countries have achieved since the 1990s in crafting more inclusive societies. Traditionally underrepresented people—including the nonunionized poor, indigenous peoples, and women—have made measurable gains in multiple areas. They now actively participate in political decision-making and enjoy access to more resources, including fiscal transfers, educational opportunities, and legal services. In their admirably lucid introduction, the editors attribute this “unprecedented expansion of citizenship” to how the region’s inequalities and poverty have manifested at the ballot box; given the repeated opportunity to vote, the poor majority not surprisingly demanded more rights, more voice, and better livelihoods. Although clearly sympathetic to leftist politics, the editors recognize that some right-wing governments have also advanced inclusionary reforms. At the same time, the editors regret that “changes were slower, less transformative, and less celebrated than promised and hoped.” Nor are these undeniable gains irreversible; progressive movements remain dangerously fragmented and decentralized. Looking ahead, the editors find grounds for both pessimism and optimism."

In this unique travelogue, he recounts retracing the exact 500-kilometer route from Rome to Ravenna taken by the patriotic Italian guerrilla fighter Giuseppe Garibaldi in 1849, after the French crushed the fledgling Roman Republic he was defending. Parks and a friend did it in one month on foot; with a smartphone in hand and small cafés, hotels, and pharmacies in every village, such a trip seems less like a pilgrimage than a pleasant daily workout. Far more interesting is his description of the unimaginable courage, suffering, and idealism of Garibaldi’s band of 5,000 ragged soldiers. As they crossed a countryside with little infrastructure, hounded constantly by crack Austrian and French forces, 95 percent of them deserted or died. Parks is also attentive to the melancholy ironies of contemporary life in the Italian countryside, with its ever-smaller and ever-older population. To rural Italians today, Garibaldi seems an irrelevant figure. There are some resonances, however: he fought to rid Italy of foreigners, and many in these regions disparage the un-Italian character of African immigrants and northern European tourists—even as they seek to exploit both."
26,Two Books on Scandinavian History,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-04-20/two-books-scandinavian-history,Two Books on Scandinavian History,"Two recent books chart the global reach of Scandinavian societies. Every nation harbors its own myths of world-historical greatness—even Iceland. No one is a more enthusiastic advocate for this tiny island than Bjarnason, a journalist who left to make a successful career in the Anglophone world. Reading his account, one would think Iceland is the Forrest Gump of countries: the inadvertent pivot of every major event in modern history. Its volcanic eruptions triggered the French Revolution. Its harbors secured the Allied victory in World War II. Its discreet diplomats helped found Israel, powered the American Bobby Fischer to the world chess title, and aided Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev in ending the Cold War. The tales of an Icelandic nanny inspired J. R. R. Tolkien’s sagas. Icelandic scientists prepared U.S. astronauts to walk on the moon, pioneered renewable energy, and provided the data behind gene splicing. And not least, Icelanders living in Greenland came to North America in the eleventh century."
27,Mussolini and the Eclipse of Italian Fascism: From Dictatorship to Populism,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-04-20/mussolini-and-eclipse-italian-fascism-dictatorship-populism,Mussolini and the Eclipse of Italian Fascism: From Dictatorship to Populism,"Bosworth is among the leading English-language biographers of the Italian dictator Benito Mussolini, and those seeking a magisterial treatment of his life and regime should consult the author’s previous work. Here, instead, is a provocative reexamination of Italian fascism. Bosworth is not an apologist for Mussolini’s excesses, but he maintains that labeling both Mussolini and Adolf Hitler as fascists obscures the relative mildness of the Italian variant. Italian fascism resembled Hitler’s Nazism or Joseph Stalin’s communism less than it did other authoritarian regimes that spread throughout Europe in the 1930s—and even some democratic systems. In Italy, domestic repression, although deplorable, was far less thorough than in Germany or the Soviet Union. Italian imperialist impulses were less brutal and far less successful than British and French efforts. Mussolini neither desired nor provoked World War II, but Italy could not avoid it as an ally of Germany shunned by the West. Even so, Italian casualties remained a third lower than the number incurred in World War I, when Italy was led by liberal governments. One might not accept all these judgments, but this book does pose the question of whether Mussolini should be understood less as a totalitarian and more as a harbinger of modern populism."
28,Pax Transatlantica: America and Europe in the Post–Cold War Era,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-04-20/pax-transatlantica-america-and-europe-post-cold-war-era,Pax Transatlantica: America and Europe in the Post–Cold War Era,"Throughout the seven decades since the founding of NATO, commentators have proclaimed that the alliance is in deep crisis. Most also combine this warning with a call for deeper “cooperation,” often a euphemism for the orthodox position that the Europeans should bear more of the burden. A critical minority, mostly on the extremes of the European political spectrum, has long complained that the United States bullies, exploits, and sometimes even subverts its European allies. This slim volume by a diplomatic historian advances a more balanced claim, based on the premise that it is natural for even the closest of allies to have serious disputes. Contrary to the conventional wisdom, the overarching trajectory of transatlantic relations has been positive: during the Cold War, NATO countries were far more bitterly divided politically than they have been since it ended. The same is true of transatlantic economic relations. This book becomes less nuanced and less empirically grounded as it approaches the present: in discussing the current challenges that populism and the pandemic pose, some of the old rhetoric of NATO’s eternal crisis returns. Yet in the end, the long historical record leads the author to view with optimism the future of the Western alliance."
29,"Brexitland: Identity, Diversity, and the Reshaping of British Politics",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-04-20/brexitland-identity-diversity-and-reshaping-british-politics,"Brexitland: Identity, Diversity, and the Reshaping of British Politics","In the past half decade, the United Kingdom’s decision to leave the European Union has produced an enormous outpouring of scholarship not just on the Brexit vote itself but also on British far-right politics and Euroskepticism. This book fills in a critical part of the story. Brexit has deep roots in two 50-year-long demographic transformations in the United Kingdom: one that changed a society in which foreign-born (and nonwhite) people were rare to one in which they are common, and another that changed a society in which university-educated people composed a single-digit minority to one in which they total roughly half of all young people. These shifts changed British attitudes toward race and ethnicity, creating a political system divided over identity politics. Yet demographics alone do not explain Brexit: the odd incentives created by the United Kingdom’s unique electoral system, the inability of the Labour Party to adjust to the new circumstances, the crosscutting imperatives of regional politics, and the traditional British imperial mindset all played important roles as well, and they help explain why no other countries have followed the United Kingdom out of the EU."
30,Crackup: The Republican Implosion and the Future of Presidential Politics,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-04-20/crackup-republican-implosion-and-future-presidential-politics,Crackup: The Republican Implosion and the Future of Presidential Politics,"The first wave of books about now former President Donald Trump concerned the man. A second wave strove to understand his supporters. Now, a timely third wave takes on the broader political environment that led to his rise and supported his administration. Popkin looks at two crucial elements of a healthy democracy: strong political parties and a functioning legislature. Only political parties with “a past to honor and a future to protect” can create collective responsibility among elected officials. Without that, there can be no coherent legislative agenda and no way for voters to hold anyone responsible for policy success or failure. With a dysfunctional legislature, power shifts to the president, to rule via executive orders that can be instantly erased by his or her successor. In order to hold together a coalition of diverse interests, political parties must marshal more resources than do outside forces. Without that discipline, parties devolve into ad hoc collections of actors pursuing individual ambitions. Popkin convincingly places much of the blame for the deepening dysfunction of recent decades on campaign finance reform efforts that failed to reduce the skyrocketing totals of campaign spending or to bring unaccountable “dark” money into the sunlight. And both parties have failed to exercise the powers they still retain—for example, the power to shape the choice of presidential candidates. Democrats should take no comfort, Popkin warns, that the Republican Party has fractured first: they are equally vulnerable."

Taking advantage of a program in Washington, D.C., that puts volunteers through the paces of the Metropolitan Police Academy—from pushups to firearms and field training—she eventually got fully certified. Her remarkable book recounts her experiences as a part-time patrol officer working for several years largely in the poorest parts of the city. In a way that a traditional scholarly book cannot, she brings to life the impossible combination of roles police officers are expected to play: “warriors, disciplinarians, protectors, mediators, social workers, educators, medics, and mentors.” She does not skimp on detailing the police abuses she encountered. Officers are sometimes trigger happy because they are taught to believe that their jobs are more dangerous than they truly are. The training officers receive, prevailing laws, and the social circumstances in which the police work are often directly at odds. And an “explosion of over-criminalization” at the state and federal level in recent decades has turned misdemeanors into felonies and small violations of regulations into more serious crimes. Brooks has produced an engaging page-turner that also outlines many broadly applicable lessons and sensible policy reforms."

The editors of this volume, two noted First Amendment scholars, use the occasion of that ruling’s 50th anniversary to review the manifold consequences of how this historic decision balanced the government’s need for secrecy in protecting national security with the public’s right to know what its government is doing. The collection includes chapters from a star-studded roster of national security practitioners, legal scholars, practicing journalists, and media experts. Together, the editors and five of the contributors also consider the effects of the revolution in information and communications technology that has transformed the world since 1971 and that has led to the huge increase in the number of government contractors with access to classified information. They recommend policy changes that could reduce the overclassification of information, encourage declassification, deter harmful leaks, encourage helpful ones, and create alternatives to leaking. But they also conclude that, notwithstanding the massive changes that have taken place in the digital realm, it would be premature to abandon the regime the Pentagon Papers case created or to do more than undertake cautious reforms to improve its functioning."

His study, the first major work focused solely on outside meddling in elections in the modern era, rests on extensive case studies and statistical analysis of an original database of 117 such interventions carried out by the Soviet Union (and, later, Russia) and the United States since World War II—81 of them by the United States. This data set alone is an important contribution and a sobering eye opener for Americans, since 70 percent of these interventions were undertaken by the United States. All told, those 117 instances account for one in every nine competitive national elections held in independent countries in that period. Levin finds that such interventions tend to occur in highly competitive elections in which the foreign intervenor sees its interests severely endangered by the candidate it opposes. Crucially, they are “inside jobs,” in the sense that success requires an actor in the target country who is willing to receive outside help. Russia’s intervention in the 2016 U.S. presidential election was only “unprecedented,” as Americans generally describe it, in its use of digital technology. Otherwise, it appears to fit the model in all respects. The book is a valuable foundation for the further study of a phenomenon that, especially when supercharged by cybertechnology, could threaten the future of electoral democracy."

It is an immense subject reaching back five centuries to the arrival of African slaves in the Americas. The book covers both the church’s personal, spiritual role, as a source of comfort, consolation, and dignity during slavery and its painful, lingering aftermath, and its institutional role, as the central pillar of organization and support in the struggle for social justice and political power from the time of the Underground Railroad to the present. The reader gains a deep understanding of why Black churches have so often been the target of bombings, arson, and other violence. The Black church has also nurtured the vital feeling of “somebody-ness.” Gates quotes the late businessman and civil rights activist Vernon Jordan, who described the experience of attending church on Sunday, wearing your best clothes, after a workweek of being called “boy”: “You not only were somebody, you felt like you were somebody.” Gates has written a book that fills a gaping hole and is equally eye-opening for novices and experts in the field."
35,The Two Rwandas,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/review-essay/2021-04-20/two-rwandas,The Two Rwandas,"On New Year’s Day 2014, Patrick Karegeya, once a top Rwandan intelligence official, was found dead in Room 905 of the up-market Michelangelo Towers hotel, in Johannesburg, South Africa. According to the police report, Karegeya’s neck was swollen, and a rope and a bloody towel were found in the hotel room’s safe, indicating that he had been strangled. As news of his murder spread, fingers pointed immediately to his childhood friend and former boss Rwandan President Paul Kagame. Karegeya had fallen out with Kagame and fled to South Africa, where he had helped start an opposition party in exile. Kagame denied any involvement in Karegeya’s killing, but several days later, at a national prayer breakfast in Kigali, Rwanda’s capital, he hinted that he wasn’t bothered by the assassination. “Whoever is against our country will not escape our wrath,” he said. “The person will face consequences. Even those who are still alive—they will face them.”"

O’Hanlon draws on his experience of engaging in the big policy debates of the last three decades, including examining the preparation behind and the legacy of the United States’ recent wars. Taking into account the polarized nature of U.S. politics, he concludes that the United States must learn to limit its ambitions even while continuing to defend core interests. He advocates a strategy of “resolute restraint,” which means, for example, that if China attacks Taiwan, the United States should move quickly to help defend the island without believing that it has to then defeat China in a wider war. This is a valuable addition to current policy debates, on issues from climate change to nuclear arms control to the challenges posed by China and Russia."

The reader is aware—although the policymakers of the time could not have been—of the difference that an early deal might have made, perhaps sparing the world the later traumas associated with the rise of Bolshevism in Russia and Nazism in Germany. Wilson was certainly keen to mediate a wider peace, and all the belligerents were aware of the benefits of at least being seen to negotiate. After a promising start, however, Wilson never quite managed to give the effort the push it needed. The demands of winning reelection inhibited him, as did his dependence on a lackluster State Department. It didn’t help that in the United Kingdom, David Lloyd George, who was then secretary of state for war, correctly surmised that an aggressive, uncompromising posture would help propel him to the position of prime minister. For its part, Germany adopted a policy of unrestricted submarine warfare. This led Wilson to break diplomatic relations with the Germans, too hastily in Zelikow’s view. The opportunity for a brokered peace was lost."

William Donovan, the head of the OSS, insisted on recruiting capable individuals for the war effort, including those of Chinese and Korean heritage—and even Japanese Americans, who had the necessary linguistic and cultural knowledge to design propaganda materials to be broadcast to Japan. Some Asian Americans worked behind enemy lines, gathering intelligence and engaging in sabotage. The book focuses on many individual stories, and in doing so, it raises interesting questions of race, gender, loyalty, and treachery. After all, these spies largely came from well-established families and were not recent immigrants."
39,Two Books on Military Strategy and Nonstate Actors,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-04-20/two-books-military-strategy-and-nonstate-actors,Two Books on Military Strategy and Nonstate Actors,"Two books raise awkward questions about whether the United States truly understands the military challenges it faces. In an important and innovative analysis, Biddle takes issue with what he sees as a lazy distinction between the regular military strategy of states and the guerrilla techniques of nonstate actors. He sees instead a spectrum of methods, with those intended for decisive battle at one end and those intended to help avoid battle at the other. Most actors seek the strategy best suited to their capabilities that is somewhere between these two extremes. Biddle looks at five campaigns waged by nonstate actors in Croatia, Iraq, Lebanon, Somalia, and Vietnam. His analysis leads to the argument that the best U.S. force posture for the future may well resemble those of the past, with more dismounted infantry than one would assume would be needed for a high-tech force and with more armor and artillery than one would think for a low-tech force."

Tuning out, I recognized the one-star general hunkered down beside me, a senior staffer in the chancellery. I tapped his sleeve and said, “So what’s it like to work for her?” He turned to me and grinned appreciatively. “It’s like working next to a nuclear power plant. It just runs, and runs, and runs.”"

Observers routinely worry that by throwing around its ever-growing economic weight, the country is managing to buy goodwill and influence. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Beijing has exploited its dominance of manufacturing supply chains to win favor by donating masks and now vaccines to foreign countries. And it has long used unfair state subsidies to tilt the playing field in favor of Chinese companies."

Former U.S. President Donald Trump’s strident “America first” foreign policy is partly to blame, but so are his attacks on democracy and human rights, both internationally and domestically. Abroad, Trump set the cause of human rights back by embracing authoritarians and alienating democratic allies. At home, he launched an assault on the electoral process, encouraged a failed insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, and systematically undermined civil rights protections, leaving his successor to grapple with multiple, overlapping human rights crises. As if that were not enough, a host of other problems await, from the pandemic to increasing competition with China and the overall decline of American power."

In a few short years, the near consensus has collapsed. Gone are the prophecies of ever-accelerating integration and the paeans to trade and investment promoting prosperity and comity for all. Now, the discussion centers on just how much the world’s two largest economies should “decouple,” on pandemic-addled governments taking control of supply chains and vaccine doses, and on techno-democracies vying with techno-authoritarians to shape the digital commons. Far from tempering geopolitical competition, trade has offered another means of waging it."

Both Democrats and Republicans are now advocating “a trade policy for the middle class.” In practice, this seems to mean tariffs and “Buy American” programs aimed at saving jobs from unfair foreign competition."

But just under a year after the deadly virus emerged in China, governments were able to authorize the use of vaccines against COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus. Vaccines that rely on messenger RNA, or mRNA, were among the first across the finish line, progressing from the genetic sequencing of the virus to human trials in less than three months. Last December, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted emergency-use authorization to an mRNA vaccine produced via a partnership between the U.S. company Pfizer and the German firm BioNTech and to another developed by the U.S. company Moderna, after clinical trials demonstrated that both were about 95 percent effective in preventing COVID-19. The public marveled at the speed of the vaccines’ development, but in truth, these vaccines—and the breakthroughs in their underlying technology—were more than a decade in the making. They represent an astonishing scientific and public health achievement."

His challenge, however, is primarily one of politics, not policy. Despite Biden’s victory in last year’s presidential election, his internationalist vision faces a deeply skeptical American public. The political foundations of U.S. internationalism have collapsed. The domestic consensus that long supported U.S. engagement abroad has come apart in the face of mounting partisan discord and a deepening rift between urban and rural Americans."

He shows that without modern, science-based farming, it would be impossible to provide adequate nutrition at affordable prices either in the United States or globally. In his view, popular critiques of industrial farming are often wide of the mark; in truth, technological advances are making farming less damaging to the environment. Precision agriculture utilizing satellite positioning, drone-based sensors, and machine learning allows farmers to produce more food using less water, less energy, and fewer chemicals. Paarlberg highlights plant-based protein as a substitute for meat and dairy as yet another science-based innovation working in the same direction. Notwithstanding this positive slant, the author insists that food processors, supermarkets, restaurant chains, commercial farmers, and, above all, governments must make important changes to successfully meet the public’s demand for safe, nutritious, and sustainable food."

In her account of the subject’s nineteenth- and twentieth-century history, Dreilinger shows that home economics has always involved much more. It was a way for female educators, in secondary schools but also in universities and other advanced settings, to develop and apply their skills in an era when many academic disciplines were closed to women. It allowed those educators to redefine, sometimes in strikingly progressive ways, women’s roles in society and the economy, modernizing contemporary perceptions of women as producers and consumers. For more than a century, research by home economists has been a source of significant scientific and commercial advances, improving food storage methods, for example, and the design of kitchens. Today, with other fields available to women, the rebranded discipline of “family and consumer sciences” is dwindling, even if it has not entirely disappeared."
50,Religion and the Rise of Capitalism,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-04-20/religion-and-rise-capitalism,Religion and the Rise of Capitalism,"Nearly a century ago, the historian R. H. Tawney wrote an identically titled book about the role of religion in the rise of the market economy. Tawney was responding to the German sociologist Max Weber, who famously argued that Calvinist religious thought had set the stage for the rise of capitalism. Although Friedman writes in the same tradition, his focus is different: he is concerned with the impact of religion not on the economy but on economic thought. He shows that a variant of Calvinism that emphasized human choice and action rather than predestination profoundly influenced Adam Smith, the Scottish political economist whose writings shaped modern economic analysis. Smith emphasized individual decision-making and the capacity of the market, as an aggregator of those decisions, to improve the human condition. Over time, the discipline of economics became more rigorous and quantitative, and the influence of religion tended to recede. Even today, however, there remains a connection between the religiosity that distinguishes the United States from other advanced economies and the almost pious belief of many Americans in the importance of human agency and the virtues of the market economy."

Although he does not dismiss the need to curb rising temperatures, he suggests that American society is getting better at adapting to climate change. Weather shocks provide incentives for businesses to develop new products, such as resilient building materials and in-home battery backup systems. Big data allows utility providers to adjust electricity and water prices in response to weather events, encouraging consumers to modify their usage in environmentally friendly ways. To be sure, it’s not just up to markets to respond to climate change. Kahn highlights the need for investments in public infrastructure to help with climate change adaptation and for reforms of urban planning rules and flood insurance laws. Still, his book shows that one need not be a climate change skeptic to be a climate change optimist."

Aghion, Antonin, and Bunel, who are responsible for much subsequent research in this area, argue that fostering innovation is all about balance. Innovation thrives with competition, but too much competition will preemptively diminish the rewards of new technologies, businesses, and ideas. International competition can stimulate innovation and efficiency, but too much risks provoking a backlash against globalization. Successfully navigating the supply chain disruptions created by COVID-19 requires strong political leaders to implement smart policies, but not leaders so strong that they can suppress organizational innovations that will disfavor them or their allies. The authors explain these dynamics and more in an eminently accessible fashion."

A month later, he revisited the theme at the Munich Security Conference, where he repudiated the “America first” policies of former President Donald Trump and committed to protecting human rights around the world. “Democracy doesn’t happen by accident,” he said. “We have to defend it, fight for it, strengthen it, renew it.” And in the contest between authoritarianism and democracy, the United States was, after a brief hiatus, again on the right side of history. “America is back,” Biden claimed."

These countries were enjoying a run of spectacular growth. Between 2000 and the early 2010s, their share of global GDP more than doubled, from 17 percent to 35 percent. Their average incomes were rapidly catching up to those of developed nations. The share of the global population living on less than $2 a day was cut nearly in half, from 28 percent to 16 percent. Assuming the boom could last indefinitely, writers began to speak of the coming “emerging markets century,” but the phrase that best captured the Zeitgeist was “the rise of the rest.” This vision of a leveled planet, with poor countries growing faster than rich ones and catching up in terms of average income, appealed to anyone rooting for the underdog."
55,America’s Military Risks Losing Its Edge,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2021-04-20/flournoy-americas-military-risks-losing-its-edge,America’s Military Risks Losing Its Edge,"For almost a decade, U.S. defense officials have deemed the return of great-power competition to be the most consequential challenge to U.S. national security. In 2012, during the Obama administration, the Defense Department announced that “U.S. forces will no longer be sized to conduct large-scale, prolonged stability operations,” such as those in Afghanistan and Iraq, marking a sharp departure from the United States’ post-9/11 defense strategy. In 2016, Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter highlighted a “return to great-power of competition.” And in 2018, the Trump administration’s National Defense Strategy crystallized this shift: “Inter-state strategic competition, not terrorism, is now the primary concern in U.S. national security,” it declared, with a particular focus on China as the pacing threat."
56,Data Is Power,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2021-04-16/data-power-new-rules-digital-age,Data Is Power,"Data is now at the center of global trade. For decades, international trade in goods and services set the pace of globalization. After the global financial crisis, however, growth in trade plateaued, and in its place came an explosion of cross-border data flows. Measured by bandwidth, cross-border data flows grew roughly 112 times over from 2008 to 2020."
57,Can Trade Work for Workers?,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2021-04-20/can-trade-work-workers,Can Trade Work for Workers?,"For decades, the promise of globalization has rested on a vision of a world in which goods, services, and capital would flow across borders as never before; whatever its other features and components, contemporary globalization has been primarily about trade and foreign investment. Today’s globalized economy has been shaped to a large extent by a series of major trade agreements that were sold as win-win propositions: corporations, investors, workers, and consumers would all benefit from lowered barriers and harmonized standards. American advocates of this view claimed that deals such as the North American Free Trade Agreement would supercharge growth, create jobs, and strengthen the United States’ standing as the world’s largest and most important economy. According to then President George H. W. Bush, “NAFTA means more exports, and more exports means more American jobs.”"
58,Competition With China Can Save the Planet,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2021-04-13/competition-china-can-save-planet,Competition With China Can Save the Planet,"Late last year, Chinese President Xi Jinping pledged that his country would reach “carbon neutrality” by 2060, meaning that by that time, it would remove every year from the atmosphere as much carbon dioxide as it emitted. China is currently the world’s largest greenhouse gas emitter, responsible for nearly 30 percent of global carbon dioxide emissions. Targeting net-zero emissions by 2060 is an ambitious goal, meant to signal Beijing’s commitment both to turning its enormous economy away from fossil fuels and to backing broader international efforts to combat climate change."
59,Globalization’s Coming  Golden Age,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2021-04-20/globalizations-coming-golden-age,Globalization’s Coming  Golden Age,"The thought that trade and globalization might make a comeback in the 2020s, picking up renewed vigor after the pandemic, may seem far-fetched. After all, COVID-19 is fragmenting the world, destroying multilateralism, and disrupting complex cross-border supply chains. The virus looks like it is completing the work of the 2008 financial crisis: the Great Recession produced more trade protectionism, forced governments to question globalization, increased hostility to migration, and, for the first time in over four decades, ushered in a sustained period in which global trade grew more slowly than global production. Even then, however, there was no complete reversal or deglobalization; rather, there was an uncertain, sputtering “slobalization.” In contrast, today’s vaccine nationalism is rapidly driving China, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States into open confrontation and sowing bitter conflict within the EU. It is all too easy to extrapolate and see a future of “nobalization”—globalization vanishing in a viral haze."
60,"The Future of Global Affairs: Managing Discontinuity, Disruption and Destruction",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-04-20/future-global-affairs-managing-discontinuity-disruption-and,"The Future of Global Affairs: Managing Discontinuity, Disruption and Destruction","This thought-provoking collection of essays surveys today’s troubled system of global governance. The contributors paint a bleak picture: the scale and scope of global problems—including pandemics, global warming, cyberwarfare, international extremist networks, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction—have simply overwhelmed the old postwar governance institutions, starting with the United Nations. The editors argue that for scholars to grasp the extent and profundity of this crisis, the study of “international relations” needs to be expanded into a multidisciplinary study of “global affairs,” which spans the fields of economics, politics, law, the environment, and development. Only this approach will help scholars understand an increasingly “complex, dynamic, and fragile” world. The environmental scientist Michael Oppenheimer argues that the world is entering an era of “illiberal globalization,” defined less by multilateral rules and more by raw power. In his contribution, Ankersen argues that the notion that globalization would overwhelm and undermine countries and lead to the “decline of the state” has not come to pass. States are reasserting their sovereign prerogatives, privileging internal security over international norms and human rights, and adapting technology and supply chains to geopolitical conflict. If the authors are right, the idea of global governance in this brave new world will be a quaint relic of an earlier era."
61,In the Shadow of International Law: Secrecy and Regime Change in the Postwar World,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-04-20/shadow-international-law-secrecy-and-regime-change-postwar-world,In the Shadow of International Law: Secrecy and Regime Change in the Postwar World,"This fascinating book argues that the growth of international law changed how powerful states decided to intervene in weaker ones. Examining cases of U.S. interventions in Latin America during the Cold War, Poznansky studies overt interventions, such as the deployment of U.S. troops to the Dominican Republic in 1965, and covert interventions, such as the Bay of Pigs invasion in 1961. He notes that great powers in the era before 1945 rarely felt obliged to operate in the shadows. This changed after 1945, according to Poznansky, with the UN Charter, which enshrined the principle of nonintervention in treaty law, a principle that was soon adopted by far-flung regional bodies. International law altered the calculus of great powers. Resorting to covert forms of intervention allowed the United States to evade damage to its credibility and charges of hypocrisy. In chapters on U.S. interventions in Chile, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, and Grenada, Poznansky presents archival evidence of officials worrying—to various degrees—about violating international law, pushing decision-makers to pursue covert rather than overt military action. International law is less a formal constraint on the conduct of military policy than part of a complex normative environment in which states operate."
62,"China, the UN, and Human Protection: Beliefs, Power, Image",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-04-20/china-un-and-human-protection-beliefs-power-image,"China, the UN, and Human Protection: Beliefs, Power, Image","In the decades after the Cold War, the United States and other leading democracies championed the idea of an empowered United Nations that would actively intervene in countries to protect human rights and safeguard civilians from armed violence. Foot shows how in more recent years, China has worked behind the scenes at the UN to promote a rival vision of security that emphasizes economic development, a strong state, and social stability. This groundbreaking study considers China’s efforts to shape UN peace operations, specifically the organization’s response to the Syrian crisis, and its broader attempt to subvert human rights principles and undercut the doctrine of “the responsibility to protect.” In Foot’s view, China is both reshaping and being shaped by the norms of the global system. It is pushing back against the Western-led liberal order in part by drawing on older notions of state sovereignty and self-determination. In an era of growing competition between China and the West, Foot offers a grand illumination of the normative battlefield."
63,Dreamworlds of Race: Empire and the Utopian Destiny of Anglo-America,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-04-20/dreamworlds-race-empire-and-utopian-destiny-anglo-america,Dreamworlds of Race: Empire and the Utopian Destiny of Anglo-America,"In the United Kingdom and the United States in the late nineteenth century, a multitude of thinkers advanced new and often startling visions of the future of the global order. In this masterly book, Bell explores the ideas of some of the most intriguing figures of this era, illuminating their dreams of a world-dominating Anglo-American political community united by race and empire. This is intellectual history at its best. The book builds on Bell’s earlier studies, which together offer a definitive account of the British imperial ideology and its deep entanglement with liberal political thought and cultural and racial hierarchy. The book focuses on four individuals: the American tycoon Andrew Carnegie, the British colonialist Cecil Rhodes, the British editor W. T. Stead, and the British novelist H. G. Wells, who were part of a loose network of thinkers who believed that the United Kingdom and the United States would together inaugurate an era of global peace. Bell is most provocative in his account of the long tradition of Western thinking about democracy and “perpetual peace” (a notion made famous by the Enlightenment-era German philosopher Immanuel Kant), which these pre–World War I Anglo-American figures transformed into a “racial peace thesis,” revealing the intimate connections between global utopianism and racism."
64,Democracy Rules,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/democracy-rules,Democracy Rules,"Today’s antidemocratic leaders, like many of the fascists and authoritarians who caused havoc in the twentieth century, are using the tools and institutions of the democratic state to consolidate their power. A key to Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban’s power grab, for example, was a change in civil service rules that allowed his party to place loyalists in supposedly nonpartisan government positions. Authoritarians also seek to gain control of the courts and intimidate the independent media (which they often deride as “the enemy of the people”). But as Müller argues in this important book, the forms of popular authoritarianism seen recently in Brazil, Hungary, India, Poland, and the United States constitute a threat to democracy but do not herald a return to the fascism of the 1930s. With today’s authoritarian regimes, there is not the mass mobilization and militarization of societies, the glorification of violence, or the remaking of populations along racial lines that was seen in mid-twentieth-century fascist states. Müller argues that the genius of democracy is its constitutional principles, which offer a road back from populist authoritarianism. First and foremost is the nonnegotiable claim that the government cannot deny the standing of particular citizens as free and equal members of the polity. A newly elected leader cannot use the military to punish his rivals or use the tax system to destroy the opposition party. Losers accept their losses, with the understanding that they are limited and temporary. In elegant and incisive terms, the book makes clear that proponents of liberal democracy must reclaim fundamental democratic principles and values."
65,Crisis of Command,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2021-04-09/national-security-crisis-command,Crisis of Command,"When U.S. President Donald Trump left office on January 20, many of those concerned about the state of civil-military relations in the United States breathed a deep sigh of relief. They shouldn’t have. Yes, Trump used the military as a political prop, referred to some of its leaders as “my generals,” and faced a Pentagon that slow-rolled his attempts to withdraw troops from battlefields around the world. But problems in the relationship between military officers and elected officials did not begin with Trump, and they did not end when Joe Biden took office."
66,Russia’s Weak Strongman,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/russia-fsu/2021-04-01/vladimir-putin-russias-weak-strongman,Russia’s Weak Strongman,"For 21 years, Vladimir Putin has reigned supreme over Russian politics. A skillful manipulator of public opinion, he wields the blunt force of repression against opponents at home and the sharp power of cyber-operations and espionage campaigns against enemies abroad. Increasingly, Western analysts and officials portray him as all-powerful, a ruthless former KGB man who imposes his will on Russia from behind dark sunglasses. This narrative, which the Kremlin goes out of its way to reinforce, is tempting to believe. Putin has jailed the closest thing he has to a political rival—the opposition leader Alexei Navalny—and crushed a wave of protests by Navalny’s supporters. Putin’s intelligence agencies brazenly hacked the U.S. government, and his troops are gradually eroding U.S. influence everywhere from Libya to Syria to Ukraine."

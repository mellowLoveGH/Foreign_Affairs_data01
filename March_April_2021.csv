0,Tales From Russian Folklore,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/tales-russian-folklore,Tales From Russian Folklore,"In the mid-nineteenth century, the ethnographer Afanasyev published around 600 Russian folktales—the world’s largest academic collection of such texts. In Russia, these tales have long been considered classics of children’s literature. Most of the texts selected for this volume are tales of wonder that contain remnants of pagan beliefs, such as nature spirits, miraculous transformations, returns from the dead, and poor but fearless heroes who must undergo many trials before winning the hearts of beautiful princesses. These tales don’t always offer easy morals. The seemingly weak and silly may turn out to be the smartest and luckiest. Humility and hard work are commonly rewarded, but sometimes even laziness is a winning strategy; Emelya the Fool, for instance, owes his success to lying on the stove all day. The translator also includes animal tales, in which the wolf is strong but stupid, the hare is cowardly, and the cunning fox easily outsmarts everybody. A third type of stories, household tales, often show wily peasants or soldiers outwitting landlords or priests. Such impiety led the tsar’s censors to ban many of Afanasyev’s tales. Unfortunately, those censored tales don’t appear in this volume."
1,Three Books on Japan's Interwar Period,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/three-books-japans-interwar-period,Three Books on Japan’s Interwar Period,"Three new books delve into how Japanese politicians, military officers, and academics navigated the tumultuous transformations of the interwar period: their country’s rapid modernization, the revolution in Russia, the rise of Asian communist and anticolonial movements, and the efforts of American and European imperial powers to contain Japanese influence in Asia. Linkhoeva explores the many ways in which Japanese thinkers of the 1920s understood the Russian Revolution. Labor leaders and leftist social scientists adopted Marxism as a framework to analyze industrialized Japan’s newly emerging class system. Anarchists emulated the tactics of Russian radicals to engage in assassinations and other acts of violence. Members of the new Japanese Communist Party debated whether Japan could make a direct transition to communism or had to first pass through a stage of bourgeois democracy. A group of self-labeled “national socialists” saw Russia’s experience as an example of state-led national strengthening that Japan should follow. Some among the government and military elites saw the new Soviet regime as a potential ally in expelling American and European powers from Asia, whereas others perceived Soviet communism as a threat to stability at home and to the empire abroad. When the Diet adopted universal manhood suffrage in 1925, it also passed a law, grounded in loyalty to the emperor, that criminalized any leftist attempt to alter the “national polity.”"
2,What Britain Did to Nigeria: A Short History of Conquest and Rule,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-02-16/what-britain-did-nigeria-short-history-conquest-and-rule,What Britain Did to Nigeria: A Short History of Conquest and Rule,"In this readable history of British colonialism in Nigeria, Siollun traces a broad arc from the first links between British explorers and various West African precolonial states, in the sixteenth century, to Nigerian independence, in 1960, sketching a series of fascinating episodes and characters along the way. Several excellent chapters cover the growth of British economic interests in the area during the nineteenth century, notably through the efforts of the mercantile National African Company. This increasing involvement in the region would lead to the establishment of two separate British protectorates, one in the south and one in the north, in 1900 and 1903, respectively. Siollun’s evenhanded assessment of the roughly 60 years of colonial rule that followed is also absorbing, particularly his description of Nigerian resistance to the various injustices and humiliations inflicted by the British. Siollun concludes with what he calls “the mistake of 1914”: his view that the British resolution to join their northern and southern protectorates into one poorly integrated colony constitutes the single most consequential decision of colonial rule in Nigeria. Ever since, the north-south divide has dominated the politics of independent Nigeria."
3,Two Books on the Belt and Road Initiative,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-02-16/two-books-belt-and-road-initiative,Two Books on the Belt and Road Initiative,"Two books explore different dimensions of the Belt and Road Initiative, China’s vast infrastructure and investment project. Ye compares the BRI, which started in 2013, with two previous programs: the Western Development Program, which was initiated in 1999 and directed funds and expertise from China’s coastal provinces to the interior, and the Go Global policy, an initiative started in 2000 that encouraged Chinese investment overseas. She discerns a common pattern. When a leader faces a national economic slowdown, he announces a program that is both “ambitious and ambiguous” in order to mobilize enterprises and government entities to invest more boldly. State-owned enterprises, ministries, and local governments scramble to fit what they are already doing or want to do under the new initiative’s umbrella and to secure authorizations, incentives, and financing. In this context, she says, “almost anybody was allowed to do almost anything.” The central government’s initiatives have led in each case to a burst of activity that strengthened subnational entities while diminishing the ability of Beijing to control these disparate actors. Despite their messiness, the programs succeeded in their ultimate goal: they kept the Chinese economy humming along and, in so doing, deepened China’s integration into the global economy."
4,The War on the Uyghurs: China’s Internal Campaign Against a Muslim Minority,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-02-16/war-uyghurs-chinas-internal-campaign-against-muslim-minority,The War on the Uyghurs: China’s Internal Campaign Against a Muslim Minority,"Roberts, a leading expert on the predominantly Muslim Uighur minority in China, reports that the frighteningly effective Chinese campaign to eliminate Uighur culture that started with mass internments in 2017 has entered a new phase, with the transfer of much of the rural Uighur population into factory labor both in the western region of Xinjiang and throughout the country. The government is also sending Uighur children to Chinese-language boarding schools, destroying mosques and Muslim shrines, banning religious and cultural practices, and imprisoning members of the Uighur cultural elite. These developments cap a long history of settler colonialism dating back to the mid-eighteenth century. In the 1980s, Chinese leaders considered integrating Xinjiang by tolerating its cultural diversity. But that path was soon abandoned, and after 2001, Beijing used Washington’s declaration of a “war on terror” to justify repression in the region. Harsh Chinese policies have provoked some reactive violence from Uighurs and have driven what is estimated to be tens of thousands of them to join jihadis in Syria. Roberts provides fascinating new details on that relatively marginal phenomenon, revealing that organized Uighur militancy is almost entirely illusory. Beijing’s policy of repressive assimilation has now reached such an intense stage that Roberts labels it “cultural genocide.”"
5,The Delusion of Knowledge Transfer: The Impact of Foreign Aid Experts on Policymaking in South Africa and Tanzania,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-02-16/delusion-knowledge-transfer-impact-foreign-aid-experts,The Delusion of Knowledge Transfer: The Impact of Foreign Aid Experts on Policymaking in South Africa and Tanzania,"The use of foreign experts to provide technical assistance and “knowledge transfer” to low-income countries has long been criticized as an ineffective form of foreign aid. Based on careful case studies in South Africa and Tanzania, Koch and Weingart examine the recent record. Their critique is pretty withering even as they accept that these experts—engineers, economists, agronomists, and public policy analysts—harbor good intentions. Foreign experts struggle to help poorer countries build local capacities; worse still, expert advice tends to advance the agendas of big donors at the expense of domestic control over policy. In a sharp chapter on the education sector in Tanzania, the authors show that the interests of donors often superseded those of Tanzanians themselves. Disappointingly, they propose no specific reforms beyond vague suggestions to devote more funding to capacity building, albeit without foreign experts. Their exhaustive analysis offers no evidence that such aid would be more effective."
6,China’s Gilded Age: The Paradox of Economic Boom and Vast Corruption,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-02-16/chinas-gilded-age-paradox-economic-boom-and-vast-corruption,China’s Gilded Age: The Paradox of Economic Boom and Vast Corruption,"Economists often claim that corruption hurts an economy, but it frequently accompanies fast growth, as it did during the American Gilded Age and in China after the death of Mao Zedong. In a book that combines deep insight into how the Chinese system works with innovative research, Ang resolves the paradox by distinguishing between three kinds of corruption that are bad for growth and the one kind that is good. Prominent officials and ordinary bureaucrats stealing directly from the public coffers are two patterns that are bad for growth; so are the payoffs that low-level public servants demand in exchange for routine actions such as granting licenses or providing medical care. The one good kind is what Ang labels “access money,” large bribes or favors given to high-level officials in exchange for land, contracts, or credit. These payoffs push the economy forward at a fast pace, although they also create longer-term problems, including inequality, debt, and excessive risk-taking. China has curtailed the bad kinds of corruption since the 1990s by routinizing payment and accounting methods, prosecuting officials who steal public funds, and rewarding officials for economic growth through fringe benefits paid out of slush funds, so they don’t have to steal to share the benefits of prosperity. But access corruption has persisted, sustained by the pressure Beijing puts on local leaders to promote growth any way they can."
7,"Political Violence in Kenya: Land, Elections, and Claim-Making",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-02-16/political-violence-kenya-land-elections-and-claim-making,"Political Violence in Kenya: Land, Elections, and Claim-Making","Political violence has ebbed and flowed throughout Kenya’s postcolonial history, often taking place around elections. And some regions of the country have proved much more violent than others. Klaus’s superb study presents an overarching explanation for these outbreaks of bloodshed in the country. Other theories of political violence in Kenya have focused on weak institutions and the grievances of citizens but remain vague about the actual mechanisms that precipitate carnage. Klaus’s extensive fieldwork has allowed her to illuminate the underpinnings of this violence. She argues that specific ethnic groups have unequal access to land and to property rights and develop the sense of being wronged by other groups. Local elites exploit these resentments for their own particular political ends, often leading to explosive violence. Curiously, her study shows that violence is more likely where unequal access is in fact not particularly high but where a local patron with political ambitions can stoke people’s dissatisfaction with the electoral process."
8,African Europeans: An Untold History,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-02-16/african-europeans-untold-history,African Europeans: An Untold History,"In a sweeping history extending from the classical world to the twentieth century, Otele masterfully analyzes the changing relationship between Africa and Europe through the lives of individual Africans who in some manner dealt with Europeans. She shows that notions of race and racial difference were relatively fluid until the seventeenth century. In the Mediterranean world, in particular, religious difference was often more of a dividing line than skin color, and Africans rose to prominent positions in Europe. Otele describes the careers of men such as Lucius Septimius Severus, a second-century Roman emperor from Libya, and Alessandro de’ Medici, probably the son of an African servant in the powerful Medici household in Florence, who became the duke of that Italian city in 1531. Otele argues convincingly that the hardening of racist European views about Africans was the inevitable result of the Atlantic slave trade and the subsequent colonial occupation of the continent. But even in this more recent hate-filled period, Otele finds examples of Africans or people of African descent who achieved prominence in Europe against the odds."
9,These Are Not Gentle People: Two Dead Men. Forty Suspects. The Trial That Broke a Small South African Town,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-02-16/these-are-not-gentle-people-two-dead-men-forty-suspects-trial,These Are Not Gentle People: Two Dead Men. Forty Suspects. The Trial That Broke a Small South African Town,"This disturbing narrative relates the 2016 deaths of two Black laborers at the hands of several dozen white farmers and the flawed, three-year trial that subsequently took place in a small town an hour and a half from Johannesburg. Harding is an unintrusive narrator and allows the rich cast of characters to tell their own versions of the story. The details of their accounts accumulate inexorably into a searing indictment of contemporary South Africa. The casual racism of the farmers and the miserable precariousness of their Black employees are depressingly familiar, as are the divisions and resentments between Black and white communities three decades after the end of apartheid. The only thing that seems to unite South Africans is pessimism about the future. Harding’s story also delivers a devastating verdict on the country’s institutions. The leading South African political parties lurked in the background of the trial, eager to score points from the proceedings with populist demagoguery. No one involved in the case trusted the police or the justice system to do the right thing. And incompetence permeated all state agencies: the assaulted laborers were allowed to die after waiting for hours without treatment, an indignity compounded by the fact that the coroner, the lawyers, and the judge consistently confused the identities of the two victims during the trial."
10,Ideology and International Institutions,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-02-16/ideology-and-international-institutions,Ideology and International Institutions,"In this impressive book, Voeten argues that although multilateral bodies such as the World Trade Organization may appear to be “neutral” and “universalistic,” they more often than not reflect the values and ideological orientations of their most powerful sponsors. The U.S.- led postwar multilateral system provided a framework for an open and rules-based global economy, but it also privileged the classical liberal values of private property, individual rights, and limited government. The collapse of the Soviet Union ended the Cold War era of ideological contestation, but Voeten sees U.S.-style liberalism facing a new challenge from an upsurge in nationalism, Islamism, populism, authoritarianism, and state-led capitalism. The book’s primary contribution is how it identifies the ideological elements of interstate bargaining over multilateral rules and institutions. Voeten concedes that many of the political disputes that take place in multilateral forums are old-fashioned parochial struggles over the distribution of economic gains. He argues that in the absence of a dominant coalition of like-minded states committed to a shared vision of international order, multilateral institutions will increasingly be shaped by short-term transactional politics."
11,The Frontlines of Peace: An Insider’s Guide to Changing the World,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-02-16/frontlines-peace-insiders-guide-changing-world,The Frontlines of Peace: An Insider’s Guide to Changing the World,"Through memoir and reportage, Autesserre tells the story of international peacekeeping and humanitarian relief operations through her own eyes and those of aid workers and victims of violence. Drawn from several decades of experience in war-torn countries such as Afghanistan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Kosovo, Autesserre paints a harrowing portrait of nongovernmental organizations, diplomats, and peacekeepers struggling to resolve conflicts. Along the way, she sharply critiques the top-down, outsider-led approach to international peacemaking, or what she calls “Peace, Inc.,” in which un and Western diplomats run the show. Autesserre argues that in these sorts of operations, outside peacekeepers and aid officials tend to interact primarily with national-level political and military leaders and rarely venture into the local conflict zones or come equipped with in-depth knowledge of the history, politics, and culture of the countries they seek to help. Autesserre calls her preferred alternative “Peaceworld,” a bottom-up approach in which aid workers immerse themselves in local areas and build ties to grassroots organizations. The book’s evocative and often moving stories all illustrate her core insight: that “peace communities” are built at the local level, neighborhood by neighborhood."
12,Grand Transitions: How the Modern World Was Made,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-02-16/grand-transitions-how-modern-world-was-made,Grand Transitions: How the Modern World Was Made,"Smil offers a sweeping account of the deep material forces that have shaped the modern world. He argues that the centuries-long move of humanity from traditional agricultural societies into a more complex, globe-spanning industrial civilization has been driven by five “grand transitions”—in population, agriculture, energy, economics, and the environment. Smil has an eye for interesting details, but he is better at showing the interconnections, turning points, and pathways of societal change than in pinpointing cause and effect. Nevertheless, he tells a remarkable story of the human capacity to innovate, build, and integrate societies across vast distances. He worries, however, that economic inequality and the rapid degradation of the environment will overwhelm the human talent for adaptation."
13,After Democracy: Imagining Our Political Future,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-02-16/after-democracy-imagining-our-political-future,After Democracy: Imagining Our Political Future,"Liberal democracy has fallen on hard times, besieged by populist and authoritarian challengers. In this fascinating, if slightly meandering, rumination on the future of democracy, Papacharissi sees glimmers of hope amid growing obstacles. From its ancient roots in classical Greece, government “by the people” has repeatedly been in crisis, faced extinction, and enjoyed moments of rebirth. Papacharissi is particularly interested in the impact on citizens of the information revolution and Internet-based communication platforms. Social media tools such as Facebook and Twitter appear to provide a “public space” for conversations, but not a “public sphere” in which citizens can engage with one another as members of a political community. The book is organized as a sort of travelogue, studded with interviews with people from a variety of countries. Across diverse political settings, these interviewees emphasize that they value democracy not just as a framework for the protection of rights but also as a way of reconciling differences and preserving the greater good of the country. Papacharissi distills her conversations into an agenda for the repair of the liberal democratic way of life: invest more in civic education, reduce economic inequality, and foster a more public interest media environment that prizes the truth."
14,Decline and Fall,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/issue-packages/2021-02-16/decline-and-fall,What’s Inside,"With the storm past, it is time to assess the damage, clean up the mess, and mull what to rebuild and how. Jessica Mathews and Jonathan Kirshner survey the broken, battered world the Biden administration has inherited and how its players view Washington now. Robert Kagan traces the gulf between the United States’ large geopolitical burdens and its public’s modest preferences. And Reuben Brigety explores the deep domestic divisions that Americans have to overcome."
15,The Sultan’s Communists: Moroccan Jews and the Politics of Belonging,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-02-16/sultans-communists-moroccan-jews-and-politics-belonging,The Sultan’s Communists: Moroccan Jews and the Politics of Belonging,"Observers often imagine personal political identities in the Middle East as ancient, inevitable, and immutable. But the twentieth-century history of Morocco’s Jewish Communists is a compelling testament to the contingency of such affiliations. Heckman focuses on the careers of five prominent members of the Moroccan Jewish community from the days of the French protectorate, in the early twentieth century, to the end of the reign of Hassan II, in 1999. These men had various allegiances and ties, including Muslim and Spanish in-laws; Algerian-born comrades; and deep attachments to the Jewish community, Moroccan nationalism, and international communism. And over the course of their lives, they dealt with dramatic changes in the political terrain, negotiating the patronage of the royal court, the contempt of French colonial authorities, Vichy anti-Semitism, Zionist campaigning, and monarchical despotism after independence in 1956. Fluid and flexible political affiliations congealed into more fixed, confined identities later in the century. At the end of their lives, after most Moroccan Jews had emigrated to Israel and communism had been all but vanquished, these erstwhile agitators and activists were, as Heckman puts it, “commodified” and ceremoniously trotted out to visitors as putative evidence of Moroccan enlightenment and tolerance."
16,"Citizenship and Its Discontents: The Struggle for Rights, Pluralism, and Inclusion in the Middle East",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-02-16/citizenship-and-its-discontents-struggle-rights-pluralism-and,"Citizenship and Its Discontents: The Struggle for Rights, Pluralism, and Inclusion in the Middle East","In this sobering edited volume, Cambanis and Hanna showcase a broad spectrum of academics, analysts, and activists in serious and provocative reflection on the disheartening results of the so-called Arab Spring. Many of the contributors were participants in the movements across the Arab world that called for “bread, freedom, and social justice”; disappointment in their failure leaps out from virtually every page. Nor are the political theorists and historians sanguine about the future; for them, the recent movements were merely episodes in long-standing struggles. Less predictably bleak are the remarkable variety and inventiveness of what the editors call “experiments in practice” during and after the uprisings. For instance, a lawyer who advised governments in Egypt, Tunisia, and Yemen offers candid reflections on post-uprising constitutional reform. The founder of Egypt’s most important independent news outlet perceptively explores journalism in the face of censorship. And a senior adviser to an Egyptian presidential candidate discusses the debilitating consequences of political stereotypes. The many contributions of this volume reveal that the fertile political debate sparked by the uprisings continues today."

But as Pratt shows, at least some of the failure to see powerful women in the region is in the eye of the beholder: Western preconceptions often make women invisible. (A personal example: when I was appointed president of the American University in Cairo, the U.S. press announced that I was the first female university president in Egypt. In fact, I was the third.) This volume, based on interviews with over 100 women activists in Egypt, Jordan, and Lebanon, traces the involvement of women in political mobilization over the last 70 years. It is a compelling portrait of women working inside, outside, and against systems of power, often at considerable cost to their personal safety and security. Pratt ends on a pessimistic note, recounting the failures of the uprisings of the so-called Arab Spring to produce genuine change. Since her focus is on activists, this concern is understandable, but women in government also merit attention: in 2020, women held a quarter of Egypt’s cabinet posts, on par with the United Kingdom and more than in the United States."
18,Graveyard of the Clerics: Everyday Activism in Saudi Arabia,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-02-16/graveyard-clerics-everyday-activism-saudi-arabia,Graveyard of the Clerics: Everyday Activism in Saudi Arabia,"Typically, the smallest unit on the organizational chart of the Muslim Brotherhood is called a “family,” a close-knit group of a dozen or so adherents. Menoret reveals that in Saudi Arabia, however, there is a smaller unit still: the “car,” a group of four or five men who get together to drive around and debate piety and politics. In this fascinating account, Menoret shows that this famously despotic country has seen quite a lot of “everyday activism,” and he links much of that activism’s organization and ideology to the modernist urban planning of the last 50 years. Authorities decanted the populations of crowded cities into vast, new suburban housing tracts with modern conveniences, long straight streets, and wide sidewalks (unused, of course, in the hot local climate), in the hope that suburban living would depoliticize the citizenry. Instead, these suburbs have served to accentuate the alienation of generations of young people who have found it difficult to socialize and develop social networks outside their families. For several decades, Islamist groups, including the Muslim Brotherhood, worked to fill the void, providing afterschool and summer camp programs. Today, government repression has restricted even these modest efforts at social mobilization, leaving the profoundly alienated youth of the kingdom with few places to turn."
19,Street Sounds: Listening to Everyday Life in Modern Egypt,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-02-16/street-sounds-listening-everyday-life-modern-egypt,Street Sounds: Listening to Everyday Life in Modern Egypt,"Everyone who has ever been to Cairo notices the city’s cacophony. This book is the story of that din. Working in the relatively new discipline of sensory history, Fahmy presents a fascinating account of the accumulation of sounds in Egypt. In the late nineteenth century, older notes—the call to prayer issuing from mosques, the slap of sandals on pavements, the clack of dominoes and backgammon tiles on café tables, the yelling of peddlers hawking their wares—began to jostle with the noises of mechanical and electrified devices. Readers may be put off by the academic jargon (the author urges the abandonment of an “ocularcentric” view of the world), but wonderfully evocative descriptions and anecdotes leaven the book. Donkey carts clank, and bicycles whistle; loud jubilation and anguish mark weddings and funerals. The advent of electricity extended social hours and gave rise to a raucous nightlife that still spills onto the streets of Cairo. Radios and televisions would eventually blare from open windows and sidewalk cafés, as railway and tram whistles pierced the air. Finally, the flourish of the ubiquitous car horn punctuates the commotion, perfecting what residents know as “the Cairo Opera.”"
20,Two Books on Material Objects in the Soviet Union,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-02-16/two-books-material-objects-soviet-union,Two Books on Material Objects in the Soviet Union,"Two books explore the meaning and impact of material objects in the Soviet Union. Golubev’s intriguing work closely follows a recent academic trend that focuses on how objects facilitate historical change. He delves into the significance of a number of everyday things and spaces, including scale models, the TV set, bodybuilders’ dumbbells, and apartment building stairwells and basements, tracing their influence on Soviet attitudes and social practices. The scale models of ships and planes that children would build in youth centers emphasized the historical continuity of Russian and Soviet technological breakthroughs, implicitly undermining the official narrative of the Bolshevik Revolution’s radical break from the prerevolutionary era. Iron weights were a key element in shaping what Soviet bodybuilders imagined to be the proper Soviet body and character. Although bodybuilding was not officially sanctioned until the late 1980s, bodybuilders sought to discipline, often by force, alternative, “non-Soviet” collections of youths, such as hippies or punks. At times, the author drifts away from his focus on materiality. In the chapter about the TV set, for instance, he dwells more on the social context of TV viewing and on specific TV shows than on the TV set itself as a material object."

In their rigorous academic study based on a vast collection of archival documents and memoirs, the authors trace the evolution of those territorial leaders from the late 1940s to the 1970s. This choice of time frame is unusual, as it cuts across Stalin’s death, the removal of his successor Nikita Khrushchev, and the early years of Leonid Brezhnev’s rule. To the authors, however, those three decades are united by one “outstanding feature”: the gradual decline in acts of repression against members of the communist leadership. Stalin controlled local leaders through an array of institutional measures and occasional purges. Khrushchev also exercised tight controls, such as through political marginalization, but mostly dispensed with overt repression. The system opened up further under Brezhnev, who relied more on co-optation than exclusion, began to recruit regional leaders locally, and avoided the “unjustified turnover of cadres.” The territorial party leaders in Stalin’s time were “substate dictators,” who built their own fiercely coercive systems of administration. Under Brezhnev, they became “party governors,” who maintained standards of decorum in everyday conduct."
22,1837: Russia’s Quiet Revolution,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-02-16/1837-russias-quiet-revolution,1837: Russia’s Quiet Revolution,"In Werth’s view, 1837 was a pivotal year in Russian history, witnessing major developments in technology, art, and intellectual life that then unfolded over time and marked Russia’s entry into the modern age. The year began with a symbolic and literal bang: in January, the great poet Aleksandr Pushkin was fatally wounded in a duel. After his death, Pushkin became a symbol of Russian national identity, still commonly referred to as “our everything” in both official and popular parlance. Elsewhere, Russia’s first railroad opened. Tsar Nicholas I issued a decree allowing the publication of provincial newspapers, which played an important role in the subsequent growth and consolidation of the intelligentsia across the vast empire. The philosopher Pyotr Chaadayev wrote Apology of a Madman, which, along with his earlier, highly controversial work, set the terms of an essential (and ongoing) debate about whether Russia should strive to emulate Europe or follow its own path. Werth combines solid historical research with a lively and occasionally playful style that makes his book an entertaining read."

The World Bank economists who wrote this report lament the “premature deindustrialization” of Latin America, where industrial employment as a share of total jobs declined before economies reached maturity. Meanwhile, the rapidly expanding service sector—a very broad grouping that includes the financial, accounting, retail trade, communications, sports and entertainment, hospitality, and tourism industries—is generally less productive than the manufacturing sector and offers workers lower wages and few benefits. The authors’ central policy recommendations target the region’s Achilles’ heel: the enduring deficits in quality education and training for all age groups. The authors do point to some grounds for optimism, however. Jobs offshored from advanced economies are expanding (rather than hollowing out) positions for middle-skilled workers in places such as Mexico and the countries of Central America. And the emergence of digital platforms could empower Latin American workers to market their competitive skills and innovative products worldwide."
24,The Costs of Inequality in Latin America: Lessons and Warnings for the Rest of the World,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-02-16/costs-inequality-latin-america-lessons-and-warnings-rest-world,The Costs of Inequality in Latin America: Lessons and Warnings for the Rest of the World,"Sánchez-Ancochea contends that many of Latin America’s woes spring from its gaping economic inequality. He writes for a general audience, drawing primarily on country-by-country case studies rather than bombarding readers with data. Some broad trends leap out. Oligarchic business owners have few incentives to invest or innovate, so their firms cannot compete in global markets; smaller firms, meanwhile, suffer from a lack of access to credit. Wealthy Latin Americans evade taxes and abandon public schools, leaving the poorly educated masses to labor in low-productivity jobs. Corruption among elites also discredits democratic systems. These outcomes fuel destructive, polarizing forms of populism that further undermine democratic institutions. As the book’s subtitle warns, Latin America’s illnesses could spread to other places, where inequalities of wealth and income are becoming more apparent. Although such claims appear plausible, Sánchez-Ancochea does not adequately explain the causal relationship between inequality and these negative political outcomes, and he avoids historical examples that might refute his ideological predilections. On the brighter side, the author cites positive examples of strong social movements and allied progressive political parties that have helped make societies more equal, even though shortsighted interventions or resurgent reactionaries have too often eroded those gains."

In 2017, this coalition persuaded El Salvador’s legislature to unanimously pass a bill banning metallic mining—the world’s first such countrywide ban. El Salvador persuaded the World Bank’s International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes to rule against the mining firm’s bid to open operations in the country. Broad and Cavanagh offer a practical David-versus-Goliath playbook for those who would mobilize both domestic and international forces to halt corporate abuses and to place the long-term welfare of communities above short-term financial gain. The authors trace stirring portraits of a diverse cast of courageous leaders who fought together to protect their corner of the planet."
26,Barrio America: How Latino Immigrants Saved the American City,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-02-16/barrio-america-how-latino-immigrants-saved-american-city,Barrio America: How Latino Immigrants Saved the American City,"Sandoval-Strausz, a historian, offers a timely antidote to the toxic rhetoric in the United States that characterizes Latino immigrants as criminals and welfare scroungers. He frames Latino history in the country as a narrative of renewal and striving. As white Americans began to flee U.S. cities in the 1960s, purposeful Mexican immigrants moved into vacant houses and opened small businesses in abandoned storefronts. New community organizations rose up that enriched American civic life. Latino urban culture transformed cityscapes with populous plazas and dynamic street life. Contrary to stereotypes prevalent in the media and political discourse, crime rates in immigrant neighborhoods have been lower than in comparable white neighborhoods. Sandoval-Strausz shows how immigrants repeatedly encountered virulent nativism; nevertheless, Latinos did not suffer the degree of discrimination that Black Americans had to face, most notably in access to home mortgages. The author laments that second-generation Latinos often abandon their distinct cultures, choosing, for example, to live a suburban lifestyle dependent on cars rather than staying in more walkable—and sociable—urban neighborhoods. The book also includes a smart overview of national immigration legislation and its often unintended consequences."

Today, one can only hope to retell his tale in clear prose, striking a proper balance between argument and narrative while citing the most vivid evidence. Ullrich, a German journalist, does this as well as any. In his account, Hitler was above all a high-stakes gambler convinced that those with the strongest political will were destined to prevail—or to die trying. This conviction was at once a strength and an inherent flaw. No matter how much Hitler won, he continued to take greater risks in a quest for world domination. It is easy to mistake such obsessive evil for insanity. And it is true that Hitler, like many politicians, was at times overconfident, holding dubious views about the world around him and firing those who told him differently. But he was also a tactical genius who trusted his own gut instincts. He knew exactly what he was risking and why—and came dangerously close to succeeding. In the end, he was willing to die for his beliefs—staging his own demise in the manner he thought most likely to serve as a heroic inspiration to future generations. Fortunately, that final effort failed utterly."
28,Scandinavian Noir: In Pursuit of a Mystery,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-02-16/scandinavian-noir-pursuit-mystery,Scandinavian Noir: In Pursuit of a Mystery,"One of Europe’s oddest cultural exports in recent decades has been “Scandinavian noir” crime fiction. Lesser, a bicoastal American writer and critic who has followed these novels, TV shows, and movies since the 1980s, uses them (and a trip to Scandinavia) as a bridge to understanding contemporary Denmark, Norway, and Sweden. Readers undeterred by self-consciously ironic narrators who describe themselves in the third person may find this frothy mix of travelogue, literary criticism, and autobiography engaging. Spoiler alert: in the end, the book’s premise explodes. Fictional Scandinavian detectives closely resemble their counterparts anywhere else. Overwhelmingly male, they resist dull middle-class lives, chafe under stifling bureaucracies, feel alienated in cities full of strangers, express ambivalence about strong women, drink too much, and fail to vanquish the evil rot at the core of society. Their real-world counterparts are nothing like this. Instead, the author encounters enlightened and fair-minded professionals—many of them women—working closely with social workers to employ international best practices in societies where the rate of violent crime is a fraction of that in an average American city."
29,Wagnerism: Art and Politics in the Shadow of Music,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-02-16/wagnerism-art-and-politics-shadow-music,Wagnerism: Art and Politics in the Shadow of Music,"Richard Wagner was Europe’s most influential artist of the nineteenth century. His virulent anti-Semitism and Adolf Hitler’s obsessive love for his operas have led many to treat him simply as a bombastic proto-Nazi—a view that Ross, a music critic at The New Yorker, challenges. Wagner, he observes, was in fact the most left-wing and antimilitaristic of the great composers. Exiled from Germany for nearly two decades after he manned the revolutionary barricades of 1848 as an anarchist, he produced a string of operas that belie his typical association with right-wing politics, including his four-opera Ring cycle, a socialist morality play about the triumph of love over power, and his final work, Parsifal, a thinly disguised meditation on Buddhism. Ross focuses especially on the transformative impact that Wagnerian opera had not just on musicians but also on generations of leading painters, poets, theater directors, choreographers, philosophers, classicists, psychologists, and filmmakers—not to mention feminists, environmentalists, gay rights activists, Zionists, African American intellectuals, and elected politicians— most of whom were on the left. Wagner’s art allowed them all to unlock their own creativity because his operas let each listener take away something different and profound."
30,A Velvet Empire: French Informal Imperialism in the Nineteenth Century,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-02-16/velvet-empire-french-informal-imperialism-nineteenth-century,A Velvet Empire: French Informal Imperialism in the Nineteenth Century,"In the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, European imperial powers preferred to control certain colonial territories by indirect means: they sought to co-opt local economic and cultural elites rather than establish full territorial control. This strategy of “informal imperialism” required far fewer resources than direct rule and allowed the imperialists to focus on economic exploitation rather than governance. The more formal “scramble for Africa” in the 1880s only intensified when imperial powers began bumping up against one another. British informal imperialism is well studied, but Todd examines its less well-known French counterpart, which took shape especially in North Africa. Whereas London enjoyed unmatched competitiveness in cotton textiles, ironwork, transport, and financial services, Paris dominated in luxury goods such as silk and velvet, women’s couture and cosmetics, home furnishings, and fine food and drink. The French also took advantage of their strong legal services sector and state-supported banks. The luxury trade was profitable enough that, contrary to what one often reads, neither France nor the United Kingdom was willing to risk war with the other late in the nineteenth century in an attempt to extend its possessions—leaving open the question of why governments established formal colonies at all."
31,Remaking One Nation: The Future of Conservatism,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-02-16/remaking-one-nation-future-conservatism,Remaking One Nation: The Future of Conservatism,"Timothy, the top political adviser to former British Prime Minister Theresa May, pleads for a reorientation of the British Conservative Party toward a new centrist ideology. The fundamental problem facing the Tories—much like what their Republican cousins across the pond are facing—is the unpopularity of the neoliberal agenda of lower taxes and economic deregulation that the party has espoused since the election of Margaret Thatcher 40 years ago. The consequent rise in inequality, social exclusion, regional blight, environmental degradation, substandard schooling, and rocky race relations has bred cynicism about government. Tory evangelizing about Brexit and nationalist identity politics generated some blue-collar support in national elections in 2019, but what now? Timothy seems sure about what the Tories should oppose: he lambasts stereotypical liberal “elites” who combine free-market economics with pro-immigrant identity politics. Yet he struggles to find an alternative. He proposes a new “communitarian” capitalism, combining a traditionally left-wing agenda of higher taxes, stricter regulation, and worker co-management of firms with stricter controls on immigration and a general (if vague) respect for “the ethnic and cultural identities of white Britons.” How current Conservatives would accept and enact this odd mix remains a mystery."
32,Quo vadis Hungaria? (Where Is Hungary Heading?): Foreign Policy Dilemmas and Strategic Vision,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-02-16/quo-vadis-hungaria-where-hungary-heading-foreign-policy-dilemmas,Quo vadis Hungaria? (Where Is Hungary Heading?): Foreign Policy Dilemmas and Strategic Vision,"Szent-Ivanyi, a Hungarian opposition politician and top diplomat, delivers a devastating critique of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban’s approach to foreign policy. He claims that Orban has sold Hungary out to authoritarians such as Russian President Vladimir Putin, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and Chinese President Xi Jinping. The author blasts this turn as “a completely wrong direction,” inconsistent with Hungarian identity and long-term interests, and advocates a restoration of “the unequivocal western orientation of our homeland.” He clearly demonstrates how Orban and his allies cynically use nationalist ideology to promote one-off economic and political deals that provide some short-term benefit to Hungary but will harm it in the long run. He hints that such deals also aid Orban’s personal electoral fortunes and line the pockets of his corrupt associates. A transactional foreign policy of this kind, the book contends, is condemned to be “incoherent, confusing, and unsuccessful”—as some might see Orban’s recent surrender to the Council of the EU on legal disputes. Although such insider critiques of one’s country’s foreign policy are commonplace in the United Kingdom and the United States, this sophisticated account is a pathbreaking exception in central Europe and worthy of a wide readership."
33,The Rate Debate,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2021-02-16/rate-debate,The Rate Debate,"The past five years of U.S. economic policy have been noisy, as the Trump administration and its allies in Congress pursued a controversial agenda: a trade war with China, a push to repeal the Affordable Care Act, tax cuts that mostly benefited the well-off, and so on. Behind this sound and fury, however, lies a story of quieter but deeper economic changes that will have far-reaching implications. That story revolves around four interconnected developments: the fall in the natural rate of interest, the remarkable decline in the price of renewable energy, the stubborn persistence of inflation below the U.S. Federal Reserve’s target of two percent, and the stunningly fast collapse and then partial rebound of the economy during the COVID-19 crisis."
34,Market Value,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/review-essay/2021-02-16/market-value,Market Value,"It has become a matter of general agreement among citizens of the richest country on earth that things are not going so well. The United States in its 245th year is an ailing nation—socially, politically, and economically. In the recent presidential election, one political party promised to “make America great again—again.” The other rallied supporters to “build back better.” Nobody talked about “morning in America” or anything similarly sunny. Everyone can see that it is dark outside."
35,Foreign Policy for Pragmatists,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2021-02-16/foreign-policy-pragmatists,Foreign Policy for Pragmatists,"Bismarck once said that the statesman’s task was to hear God’s footsteps marching through history and try to catch his coattails as he went past. U.S. President George W. Bush agreed. In his second inaugural address, Bush argued that “history has an ebb and flow of justice, but history also has a visible direction, set by liberty and the Author of Liberty.” President Donald Trump had a different take. His National Security Strategy claimed: “A central continuity in history is the contest for power. The present time period is no different.” The Bush team saw history moving forward along a sunlit path; the Trump team saw it as a gloomy eternal return. Those beliefs led them to care about different issues, expect different things of the world, and pursue different foreign policies."
36,System Failure,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2021-02-16/system-failure,System Failure,"Shared transnational challenges are supposed to bring the world together. The COVID-19 pandemic, however, has done the opposite, exposing the shortcomings of the structures that govern global health. At the start, countries scrambled in a free-for-all for medical supplies. They imposed travel bans and tightly guarded data about the novel disease. The World Health Organization (WHO), after struggling to secure Chinese cooperation, became a scapegoat for U.S. President Donald Trump, who announced that the United States would withdraw from the international health body."
37,Strongmen: Mussolini to the Present,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/strongmen-mussolini-present,Strongmen: Mussolini to the Present,"The protagonists of this illuminating study of authoritarian rulers range from early-twentieth-century fascists such as Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini, to postcolonial strongmen in Iraq, Libya, and Uganda, to modern autocrats who rode elections into office in Brazil, Hungary, the Philippines, Russia, Turkey, and, yes, the United States. It is disturbing how comfortably U.S. President Donald Trump fits into this lineup. From his dark inauguration speech to his wild attempts to overturn the 2020 presidential election, much of Trump’s behavior—including his inability to conceive of his own failure—makes perfect sense according to Ben-Ghiat’s authoritarian playbook. Her closing warning that “strongmen do not vanish with their exits from power, but . . . remain as traces within the body of their people” could not be more timely."

The book is not quite what the title promises, instead offering a highly selective retelling of notable incidents in U.S. diplomacy. The rationale for what Zoellick includes and omits is not always clear. His chapters on the pathbreaking contributions of three secretaries of state—Elihu Root, who served under President Theodore Roosevelt and championed international law, Charles Evans Hughes, who served in the 1920s and secured agreements on arms control, and Cordell Hull, who served under President Franklin Roosevelt and helped lay the groundwork for the postwar liberal order—are particularly interesting, as is his treatment of the science administrator Vannevar Bush, whose work under Roosevelt during World War II laid the foundation for later U.S. preeminence in science and technology. But in most cases, the important subject areas these discussions open up do not reappear. Dismissive of doctrines, Zoellick points instead to five enduring “traditions” that should guide U.S. policymakers: the need for U.S. dominance in North America, the importance of trade and technology to national security and the economy, the value of alliances, the influence of public opinion and Congress on policymaking, and Washington’s special leadership role in the world."
39,The Ten Year War: Obamacare and the Unfinished Crusade for Universal Coverage,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/ten-year-war-obamacare-and-unfinished-crusade-universal-coverage,The Ten Year War: Obamacare and the Unfinished Crusade for Universal Coverage,"The “ten year war” of the title refers to the decade from U.S. President Barack Obama’s election in 2008 to the defeat of the House Republican majority in 2018, in which no political issue was more decisive than the Affordable Care Act, the most important piece of legislation in the country in half a century. Cohn recognizes that the law is “highly flawed, distressingly compromised, [and] woefully incomplete,” but he nonetheless credits the act with representing a major step toward establishing affordable health care as a universal right, as it is in every other developed country. Unrelenting Republican determination to repeal the law and replace it with an undefined alternative has prevented legislators from correcting the inevitable defects in a massive new government program, leaving the law weaker than it should be. Cohn traces the debate over the ACA as it unfolded in think tanks, lobbyist offices, legislative committees, and the Oval Office with impressive clarity and in an engaging, highly readable narrative that makes arcane issues accessible. His own bias in favor of universal coverage is explicit, but he treats fairly the philosophical and economic arguments of the opposing view. This valuable history will help inform the continuing battle for an efficient, equitable, and affordable U.S. health-care system."
40,The American Crisis: What Went Wrong. How We Recover.,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/american-crisis-what-went-wrong-how-we-recover,The American Crisis: What Went Wrong. How We Recover.,"This collection of some of the best recent writing in The Atlantic delays discussion of U.S. President Donald Trump and Trumpism until the second half of the book. It begins with considerations of the destabilizing forces that have grown in recent decades: widening economic inequality, declining social mobility, structural racism, and a fractured health-care system still impervious to full reform. The next set of essays turn to politics, parsing the roles of individuals (such as former Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich and the former Trump aide Paul Manafort) and broader sources of political dysfunction, including voter suppression, gerrymandering, expanded presidential powers, and social media. The collection of pieces on Trump, his family, his advisers, and his policies includes great reporting and gripping insights, especially in the shortest piece in the book, “The Cruelty Is the Point,” by Adam Serwer, which was originally published in 2018 but is equally applicable to the emotions let loose in the attack on the U.S. Capitol in January. The last section, weak only by comparison to what precedes it, turns to the future, not so much with policy recommendations as with reminders of the “tools still at our disposal—values, outlooks, attitudes, instincts.” This volume is a superb resource in helping Americans understand how they have arrived where they are now."
41,A Promised Land,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/promised-land,A Promised Land,"Obama is a gifted writer. His prose is lean, supple, graphic, and lively. In a dozen words, he can snap a memorable picture of a political interlocutor or a foreign leader. He set out to recount what happened during his presidency, elucidate the subtleties of policy debates, and convey “what it’s like to be the president of the United States.” Although he has succeeded in each, these multiple ambitions mean that what was intended to be a single-volume, 500-page memoir ended up being 700 pages and only covering the first 30 months of his presidency. The book’s length is also the result of thoughtful but unfinished conversations he holds with himself on nearly every subject. Phrases such as “To this day I wonder . . . whether I should have been bolder” appear on page after page. Obama began writing only a month after the end of his eight-year tenure as president. Had he taken longer to digest the experience, more of these open-ended reflections might have reached conclusions. Perhaps that will come in the next installment, which may also address some of the odd omissions in this volume, such as the nuclear policy issues to which he devoted so much effort while in office."
42,The Arena,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/review-essay/2021-02-16/arena,The Arena,"When I served as a Singaporean diplomat, I once asked a Vietnamese counterpart what an impending leadership change in Hanoi meant for his country’s relations with China. “Every Vietnamese leader,” he replied, “must get along with China, every Vietnamese leader must stand up to China, and if you can’t do both at the same time, you don’t deserve to be leader.”"
43,"A Superpower, Like It or Not",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2021-02-16/superpower-it-or-not,"A Superpower, Like It or Not","All great powers have a deeply ingrained self-perception shaped by historical experience, geography, culture, beliefs, and myths. Many Chinese today yearn to recover the greatness of a time when they ruled unchallenged at the pinnacle of their civilization, before “the century of humiliation.” Russians are nostalgic for Soviet days, when they were the other superpower and ruled from Poland to Vladivostok. Henry Kissinger once observed that Iranian leaders had to choose whether they wanted to be “a nation or a cause,” but great powers and aspiring great powers often see themselves as both. Their self-perception shapes their definition of the national interest, of what constitutes genuine security and the actions and resources necessary to achieve it. Often, it is these self-perceptions that drive nations, empires, and city-states forward. And sometimes to their ruin. Much of the drama of the past century resulted from great powers whose aspirations exceeded their capacity."
44,The Stories  China Tells,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/review-essay/2021-02-16/stories-china-tells,The Stories  China Tells,"On September 3, 2015, a procession of Chinese missile launchers and more than 12,000 soldiers paraded through Tiananmen Square, in Beijing, to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II. Some 850,000 civilians were deployed to patrol Beijing; in parts of the city, business, traffic, and all wireless communications were shut down. But lest anyone get the wrong impression, President Xi Jinping delivered an address meant to assuage those alarmed by all the firepower and manpower on display. “No matter how much stronger it may become, China will never seek hegemony or expansion,” he assured his audience, which included a few dozen world leaders."
45,Present at the Re-creation?,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2021-02-16/present-re-creation,Present at the Re-creation?,"For years, Joe Biden has portrayed the presidency of Donald Trump as an aberration from which the United States can quickly recover. Throughout the 2020 U.S. presidential campaign, Biden asserted that under his leadership, the United States would be “back at the head of the table.” But a return to the pre-Trump status quo is not possible. The world—and the United States—have changed far too much. And although hailing the return of American hegemony might seem comforting to Americans, it reveals a degree of tone-deafness to how it sounds to the rest of the world. When people elsewhere look at Washington’s track record over the past two decades, they don’t see confident leadership. What they see, instead, are a series of disasters authored by Washington, chief among them the 2003 invasion of Iraq and the subsequent destabilization of much of the Middle East and the 2008 global financial crisis. During those decades, Washington also pursued an ineffectual war in Afghanistan, an incoherent policy in Syria, and ill-judged humanitarian interventions, most notably in Libya."

They feature matter-of-fact descriptions, burnished with plentiful illustrations and maps. The Ho Chi Minh Trail, which helped supply North Vietnamese and Vietcong forces during the Vietnam War, certainly deserves a volume of its own. The trail was a logistical marvel, dipping in and out of Cambodia and Laos, running more than 12,000 miles over mountains and through jungles, and employing over 100,000 workers. The route sustained North Vietnam’s war effort and was kept open despite numerous bids to shut it down. Davies outlines the various U.S. attempts—including airstrikes and the employment of sensors and physical barriers—to stop the North Vietnamese from using the trail. He concentrates on the actions of the U.S. Air Force, neglecting the contribution of U.S. Navy and Marine flyers. Despite the military and technological prowess of the Americans, the North Vietnamese were sufficiently resourceful to keep their supplies moving."

Some psychiatrists described forms of conscientious objection—defying conscription and refusing to fight on ethical grounds—as a medical pathology. All of this foreshadowed the later practices of the Nazis. Drawing from meticulous research into patient records, Bennette complicates this picture. She shows that many psychiatrists were actually more sympathetic than previously imagined to those patients suffering from the trauma of their time on the front. Her investigations also reveal that many more Germans were conscientious objectors than had been assumed. Although they could be harsh and dismissive, many psychiatrists provided a space in which traumatized veterans and dissidents could express themselves."

Ferris’s narrative takes on the breaking of the Nazis’ Enigma code at Bletchley Park during World War II and the efforts to replicate that achievement during the Cold War. GCHQ now plays a major role in all areas of cybersecurity. Its activities, along with those of the U.S. National Security Agency, were compromised when a former NSA contractor, Edward Snowden, revealed them in 2013. Ferris’s account avoids sensationalism. It provides a careful judgment of Bletchley Park’s impact, points to how signals intelligence during the Cold War usefully illuminated the lower levels of the Soviet system, and shows GCHQ’s operational importance to the conduct of colonial and postcolonial conflicts, including the 1982 Falklands War."
49,Adaptation Under Fire: How Militaries Change in Wartime,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/adaptation-under-fire-how-militaries-change-wartime,Adaptation Under Fire: How Militaries Change in Wartime,"U.S. armed forces are commonly described as inflexible, too easily caught out by the unexpected features of a conflict. Barno and Bensahel trace the factors that enable more nimble adaptability: technology, shrewd leadership, and sound doctrine. They examine how these factors have helped account for U.S. military successes and failures in operations dating back to World War II. U.S. armed forces adapted well in learning to work with the Northern Alliance in Afghanistan in 2001 and with tribal coalitions during the so-called Anbar Awakening in Iraq in 2005. Then, however, General David McKiernan in Afghanistan and General George Casey in Iraq struggled to adjust their tactics to conditions on the ground and so failed to stem the tide of violence. The authors warn of the coming radical changes in the strategic environment, including increasing tension with China, and argue that the U.S. military has to transform the way it goes about its business, resisting doctrinal rigidity and organizational inertia and finding new kinds of leaders. This is a thoughtful and informed analysis, even though it has quite a narrow focus on land forces and doesn’t consider the political contexts of U.S. military operations, especially in conflicts in which the United States has had to work closely with local forces."
50,Eagle Down: The Last Special Forces Fighting the Forever War,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/eagle-down-last-special-forces-fighting-forever-war,Eagle Down: The Last Special Forces Fighting the Forever War,"Almost two decades after the 9/11 attacks, U.S. Special Forces are still fighting in Afghanistan and trying to keep the Taliban at bay. This long war consists of numerous small engagements, barely noticed back home unless the casualties are unusually heavy or the government in Kabul loses control of some vital city. Covering the fighting since 2015, Donati captures the chaos and arbitrariness of the war: soldiers die as they enter a supposedly friendly Afghan base, are maimed stepping on mines, try to keep wounded colleagues alive as they wait for an evacuation helicopter to arrive, and inadvertently call in an airstrike on a hospital, killing doctors and patients. Donati speaks with military wives who recall the moment they heard about the death of their partner and with veterans trying to make their way in civilian life. Her vivid, uncompromising reporting presents U.S. politicians and senior military commanders as disconnected from the reality of the war as they flounder in search of a satisfactory way out of it."
51,Angrynomics,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/angrynomics,Angrynomics,"Framed as a dialogue between a hedge fund manager (Lonergan) and a political scientist (Blyth), this equally entertaining and rigorous book locates the roots of today’s angry, antiestablishment politics in macroeconomic and financial instability, technological change, and rising inequality, which together have created a sense of economic exclusion and insecurity. But despite emphasizing the economic origins of political movements, the authors build less than one might expect on the extensive scholarly literature on economic populism and give short shrift to explanations that focus on culture and identity politics. The book is strongest when it offers novel policies for stabilizing the economy and for addressing stagnation and insecurity, including two-tier interest rates (one at which the central bank lends, and another that it pays on deposits or reserves), cash transfers to households (“helicopter money”), and a national wealth fund to tackle inequality."
52,The Mismeasure of Progress: Economic Growth and Its Critics,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/mismeasure-progress-economic-growth-and-its-critics,The Mismeasure of Progress: Economic Growth and Its Critics,"Gross national product is a familiar measure of the size of an economy, and the change in GNP is a familiar measure of the rate of economic growth. But decisions about what to include in GNP and how to value those components turn on how economic activity is conceptualized by the social scientists and statisticians responsible for constructing the measure. Macekura traces the genesis and trajectory of the idea over the course of the twentieth century. He shows how the invention of GNP encouraged a focus on aggregate economic growth as the objective of economic policy and describes the long line of skeptics who have criticized GNP for neglecting nonmarket work, ignoring the distribution of income, failing to account for resource depletion and environmental degradation, and focusing on output rather than human welfare or happiness. The reader comes away persuaded that GNP, although an imperfect summary indicator of the state of an economy, plays an outsize role in contemporary conceptions of economic policy and performance."

The book is part synthesis of scholarship and part polemic—not a bad thing when one is addressing a wide audience. Her analysis is informed by fieldwork in Ghana, South Africa, and Uganda and also by reams of data from international institutions and nongovernmental organizations. Scott documents the costs, in terms of equity but also in terms of economic development and growth, of gender gaps in education, pay, and access to finance, shedding light on the societal origins of these disparities. She shows how simple interventions in developing countries—providing sanitary pads to encourage school attendance by young women, for instance—can make a difference. As for why such interventions are not more extensive, Scott points to patriarchal societies that deny women a seat at the decision-making table. She applies the same critique to advanced countries and to the economics profession itself, which she indicts for its limited attention to issues of gender inequality."
54,"The Great Demographic Reversal: Ageing Societies, Waning Inequality, and an Inflation Revival",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/great-demographic-reversal-ageing-societies-waning-inequality-and-inflation,"The Great Demographic Reversal: Ageing Societies, Waning Inequality, and an Inflation Revival","In this thought-provoking book, Goodhart and Pradhan seek to explain the rising inequality, stagnant wages, and disinflationary pressures of recent years. They describe how the integration into the world economy of China and other emerging markets, with their initially young populations, added billions of workers to the global labor force. In the advanced economies, this disadvantaged less skilled workers, reduced the power of workers and labor unions, and increased inequality. In addition, a flood of new supply into global markets, together with China’s high savings, put a lid on global inflation. But as populations now age, including in China, and as the high savings rates of more elderly populations come down, the same dynamics will run in reverse. This will make for falling inequality, rising wages, and higher inflation. Perhaps, as the authors argue, demography is destiny. Still, one wonders whether politicians might also have something to say about what happens to the distribution of wealth and income and whether central banks will really be powerless to shape the course of inflation."
55,Opening Up the Order,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/world/2021-02-16/opening-order,Opening Up the Order,"When the world looks back on the response to the COVID-19 pandemic, one lesson it will draw is the value of competent national governments—the kind that imposed social-distancing restrictions, delivered clear public health messaging, and implemented testing and contact tracing. It will also, however, recall the importance of the CEOs, philanthropists, epidemiologists, doctors, investors, civic leaders, mayors, and governors who stepped in when national leaders failed."
56,Democracy on the Defense,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2021-02-16/democracy-defense,Democracy on the Defense,"After the Cold War ended, it looked like democracy was on the march. But that confident optimism was misplaced. With the benefit of hindsight, it is clear that it was naive to expect democracy to spread to all corners of the world. The authoritarian turn of recent years reflects the flaws and failings of democratic systems."
57,The Fractured Power,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2021-02-16/fractured-power,The Fractured Power,"When the United States looks abroad to assess the risk of conflict, it relies on a host of tools to understand other countries’ social and political divisions and how likely they are to result in unrest or violence. These techniques reflect decades of research, in both government and academia, into the root causes of civil disorder and state failure. The idea is that by better understanding those causes, policymakers can prevent conflict before it breaks out or, failing that, help states recover quickly once it does."
58,How the WTO Changed China,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2021-02-16/how-wto-changed-china,How the WTO Changed China,"When China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001, the event was hailed as a pivotal development for the global economic system and a bold marker of the country’s commitment to reform. It took 15 long years of negotiation to reach the deal, a reflection of the challenge of reconciling China’s communist command economy with global trading rules and of the international community’s insistence that China sign on to ambitious commitments and conditions. U.S. officials had high hopes that those terms of entry would fix China on the path of market liberalization and integrate the country into the global economic order. U.S. President Bill Clinton called Beijing’s accession to the WTO “the most significant opportunity that we have had to create positive change in China since the 1970s” and argued that it would “commit China to play by the rules of the international trading system.”"
59,A Palestinian Reckoning,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/middle-east/2021-02-16/palestinian-reckoning,A Palestinian Reckoning,"The official Arab-Israeli conflict has ended. Over the past several months, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Sudan, and Morocco have normalized relations with Israel. Oman may be on its way to doing so, and Saudi Arabia has taken unprecedented steps in that direction. Other Arab governments maintain important, albeit discreet, ties with Israel, and further moves toward normalization appear to be only a matter of time. Egypt and Jordan have been at peace with Israel for decades."
60,A New Conservatism,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2021-02-12/new-conservatism-free-market,A New Conservatism,"The COVID-19 pandemic sent U.S. policymakers scurrying to their bookshelves, searching for responses to a public health catastrophe that threatened to plunge households, businesses, and governments into financial despair. Republicans on Capitol Hill and in the White House flipped frantically through their dog-eared playbooks from the 1980s to determine just the right tax cut for the moment. But the chapter on society-wide lockdowns was nowhere to be found."
61,The Innovation Wars,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2021-02-10/technology-innovation-wars,The Innovation Wars,"Since the early days of the Cold War, the United States has led the world in technology. Over the course of the so-called American century, the country conquered space, spearheaded the Internet, and brought the world the iPhone. In recent years, however, China has undertaken an impressive effort to claim the mantle of technological leadership, investing hundreds of billions of dollars in robotics, artificial intelligence, microelectronics, green energy, and much more. Washington has tended to view Beijing’s massive technology investments primarily in military terms, but defense capabilities are merely one aspect of great-power competition today—little more than table stakes. Beijing is playing a more sophisticated game, using technological innovation as a way of advancing its goals without having to resort to war. Chinese companies are selling 5G wireless infrastructure around the world, harnessing synthetic biology to bolster food supplies, and racing to build smaller and faster microchips, all in a bid to grow China’s power."
62,Intentions in Great Power Politics: Uncertainty and the Roots of Conflict,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-02-16/intentions-great-power-politics-uncertainty-and-roots-conflict,Intentions in Great Power Politics: Uncertainty and the Roots of Conflict,"One of the oldest insights in the study of international relations is that peaceful relations among great powers hinge on trust. In this engaging book, Rosato surveys great-power relations across the modern era and concludes that it is mistrust—not trust—that is deeply rooted and ubiquitous. His key claim is that a state can build trust only when it has credible knowledge of another state’s true intentions and that, even under the best of circumstances, acquiring such knowledge is difficult. Obviously, mistrust is famously a defining feature of great-power politics: think, for instance, of Anglo-German and Franco-German relations in the decades before World War I. But Rosato concludes that even in more favorable situations (such as relations between the United Kingdom and the United States at the turn of the twentieth century), leaders were never able to acquire “first hand information” of the other state’s true intentions. Rosato’s argument verges on a simple truism: there are inherent epistemological limits on what a state can know for sure about another state. His theory yields a “depressing prediction” regarding U.S.-Chinese relations, which he sees as burdened with cultural, ideological, and institutional barriers to understanding each other’s intentions."
63,Accomplice to Carnage,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2021-02-09/how-america-enables-war-yemen,Accomplice to Carnage,"Editor's Note: After this article went to press, the Biden administration announced a number of measures that align with recommendations it made, including reversing the Trump administration's designation of the Houthis as a terrorist organization, appointing a special envoy for Yemen, curtailing support for offensive operations by the Saudi-led coalition in the conflict, supporting the UN-led peace process, and offering assurances to Saudi Arabia regarding the defense of its territorial integrity. Also after the article went to press, one of its authors, Robert Malley, was appointed U.S. special envoy to Iran."
64,Short of War,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2021-02-05/kevin-rudd-usa-chinese-confrontation-short-of-war,Short of War,"Officials in Washington and Beijing don’t agree on much these days, but there is one thing on which they see eye to eye: the contest between their two countries will enter a decisive phase in the 2020s. This will be the decade of living dangerously. No matter what strategies the two sides pursue or what events unfold, the tension between the United States and China will grow, and competition will intensify; it is inevitable. War, however, is not. It remains possible for the two countries to put in place guardrails that would prevent a catastrophe: a joint framework for what I call “managed strategic competition” would reduce the risk of competition escalating into open conflict."
65,Gone But Not Forgotten,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2021-01-29/trump-gone-not-forgotten,Gone But Not Forgotten,"In the first lecture of any introduction to international relations class, students are typically warned of the pitiless consequences of anarchy. World politics, they are informed, is a self-help system: in the absence of a global authority to enforce rules, there are no guarantees that the behavior of others—at times, dangerous and malevolent others—will be restrained. With their very survival on the line, countries must anticipate the worst about the world and plan and behave accordingly."

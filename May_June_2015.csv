1,Empire of Cotton: A Global History,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2015-12-14/empire-cotton-global-history,Empire of Cotton: A Global History,"Two main camps dominate scholarship on the origins of capitalism. Internalists argue that capitalism was born European, or more specifically British, and then became global. A system of interconnected parts and peoples, it radiated out from a few original hot spots and over time replaced the “isms” it encountered elsewhere. The internalist narrative has long been shadowed by an externalist rival, which sees Europe’s leap forward as dependent on relations with places beyond Europe. The most recent externalist explanation of capitalism is Beckert’s Empire of Cotton. Beckert, a leading global historian, offers a dark story of capitalism, born of worldwide empire and violence. The book is a triple threat: it insists that the Industrial Revolution would never have happened without external trade, that the rise of industrialism and factory labor would never have transpired without the spread of slave labor, and that cotton was a commodity that made an empire and thus the world economy. In other words, capitalism was born global because it required an empire to buoy it."
2,Violent Capitalism and Hybrid Identity in the Eastern Congo: Power to the Margins,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2015-04-20/violent-capitalism-and-hybrid-identity-eastern-congo-power,Violent Capitalism and Hybrid Identity in the Eastern Congo: Power to the Margins,"The area surrounding the border between Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo has not been ruled effectively by any sovereign state in decades and has been mired in ethnic violence since the mid-1990s, when the Congolese state collapsed. Raeymaekers has conducted extensive fieldwork in this dangerous part of the world, which allows him to provide fascinating information on the practices, discourse, and power relations of the individuals and firms that exist and sometimes thrive in this Hobbesian environment. His compelling account examines the nature of economic activity in the midst of the area’s long-standing instability, and he finds that new kinds of social organizations have replaced or co-opted the moribund state structures, regulating markets and providing the modicum of authority necessary for them to function. Often linked to specific networks of producers, these new organizations allow for some level of capitalist accumulation but make no contribution to the goal of lasting peace and have little interest in building any kind of political community. Indeed, the power and wealth they have accrued have probably made peace and effective state building less likely.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."
3,States at Work: Dynamics of African Bureaucracies,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2015-04-20/states-work-dynamics-african-bureaucracies,States at Work: Dynamics of African Bureaucracies,"This collection of essays on African bureaucracies offers some profound insights, presenting excellent case studies of the day-to-day workings of specific agencies, including Senegal’s forest service, Niger’s district courts, Cameroon’s education ministry, and Malawi’s central administrative bureaucracy. Most of these organizations are hamstrung by inadequate finances and personnel and are held back by highly centralized, hierarchical structures, in which most of the resources get captured by the top of the administrative pyramid. A number of contributors emphasize the negative effects of reforms that are frequently imposed by external donors but rarely implemented in full. This is a bleak picture, but the book also observes that many African bureaucracies have maintained enough institutional vitality and experience to provide decent public services and are often staffed by professionals who demonstrate remarkable ingenuity while serving the public in less-than-ideal circumstances.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."
4,Inside South Africa's Foreign Policy: Diplomacy in Africa from Smuts to Mbeki,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2015-04-20/inside-south-africas-foreign-policy-diplomacy-africa-smuts-mbeki,Inside South Africa’s Foreign Policy: Diplomacy in Africa from Smuts to Mbeki,"This sharp investigation into the factors that shape South Africa’s foreign policy is well worth reading for anyone interested in the country’s politics. Through a number of remarkable interviews with South African elites, Siko examines the impact that interest groups, the press, big business, political parties, and the legislative branch have on foreign policy. He finds that although all those players exercise some influence, the executive branch has historically maintained a considerable amount of autonomy, as presidents and their collaborators have pursued their own sense of the national interest. Siko further argues that the emergence of majority rule in the mid-1990s did little to alter this culture of executive dominance, despite much rhetoric about the democratization of policymaking. He explains this continuity by pointing out that the South African public is generally uninterested in foreign policy; there is little pressure to change the way things have normally been done. Apartheid also played a role, by encouraging the fragmentation of nongovernmental groups, which even today rarely collaborate to advance common interests. Siko’s analysis is largely focused on process, but along the way he does discuss some specific cases of policy in action, such as South African President Thabo Mbeki’s “quiet diplomacy” toward the crisis in Zimbabwe during the first decade of this century.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."
5,Stones of Contention: A History of Africa's Diamonds,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2015-04-20/stones-contention-history-africas-diamonds,Stones of Contention: A History of Africa’s Diamonds,"Africa produces more than half of the world’s diamonds. As Cleveland’s book makes clear, a combination of high value and low volume makes the stones a destabilizing resource, and the concept of “blood diamonds” has become a familiar trope in African affairs. But this concise history of the African diamond trade, which began with the discovery of a diamond in South Africa in 1867, evinces a more nuanced understanding of its impact on the continent. An excellent chapter on Botswana, the single largest producer of diamonds, makes clear that in some circumstances, the precious stones can be a force for economic development and state building, if a government converts its diamond revenues into productive investments in education, health, and infrastructure—as Botswana’s has done. The book also includes a fascinating chapter on the history of De Beers, the South African diamond company that, according to Cleveland, has long exerted tight control over global prices by stockpiling uncut diamonds and limiting the number available on the market at any given time.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."
6,"Why States Recover: Changing Walking Societies into Winning Nations, from Afghanistan to Zimbabwe",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2015-04-20/why-states-recover-changing-walking-societies-winning-nations,"Why States Recover: Changing Walking Societies into Winning Nations, from Afghanistan to Zimbabwe","In this sprawling inquiry into why several dozen low-income countries, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa, collapsed and why some of them subsequently recovered, Mills finds more answers in domestic politics than in international factors. In most of these “walking societies”—a term Mills coins to describe places where people walk everywhere, which he sees as an indication of inefficiency—dysfunctional political systems led to crises, and only effective national-level leadership and viable governing coalitions could chart  a path back to stability. Mills argues convincingly that although outsiders and foreign aid can help, without local resolve, such assistance is mostly wasted. On the other hand, Mills acknowledges that absent an external force, dysfunctional political systems can persist for decades, at a huge cost to local populations. The book is impressive in its mastery of the histories of so many countries and is clearly based on a significant amount of fieldwork. But Mills says too little about how and why good governance emerges in the first place.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."
7,Deng Xiaoping: A Revolutionary Life,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2015-04-20/deng-xiaoping-revolutionary-life,Deng Xiaoping: A Revolutionary Life,"Like the heroes of a Hollywood Western riding into town to clean up a mess, Pantsov and Levine have swept into the unruly genre of contemporary Chinese biography. Pantsov contends with Soviet archives, while Levine wrangles Chinese-language materials and secondary sources in English. Both bring prodigious energy and research firepower to their work. Their previous collaboration, 2012’s Mao: The Real Story, questioned the conventional wisdom among U.S.-based China specialists that Mao Zedong retained a good deal of independence from Soviet leader Joseph Stalin and his Comintern; Pantsov and Levine emphasized Mao’s loyalty to both. Their portrait of Mao’s successor, Deng Xiaoping, cuts in a similar direction: despite the independence and pragmatism that Deng displayed later in life, Pantsov and Levine argue that the distinguishing features of Deng’s formative years were his servility to Mao and his extreme radicalism. They claim that their interpretation finally sets the record straight after many previous efforts missed the mark; this pretension lends their work a certain dynamism but also detracts from the authority of a well-researched, interesting, and readable book about an elusive figure who exhibited a curious combination of idealism and ruthlessness."
8,The Nature of Asian Politics,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2015-04-20/nature-asian-politics,The Nature of Asian Politics,"In this ambitious book, Gilley offers a novel way to understand the politics of East and Southeast Asia. He proposes that states in the region succeed or fail according to how closely they hew to what he dubs “the Asian Governance Model,” in which a widely acknowledged political authority “allocates political values in a non-patrimonial manner that advances broadly shared development, internal and external security and social opportunity through a form of governance that is characterized by the traits of rationality, accountability and propriety.” He alternates between grand theory and fine-grained analysis. The book is engaging and will surely stimulate classroom debates. But Gilley weakens his own argument by repeatedly insinuating that at heart, Asians simply prefer despots. Gilley’s model downplays the intense ambivalence many in the region feel toward state authority, and he sometimes misses the fact that in Asia, as the saying goes, the emperor’s writ often stops at the village gate.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

But that post was merely the culmination of a distinguished 42-year career in Asia. Gregg started out as a CIA operations officer based in Burma, Japan, South Korea, and Vietnam and later served as a member of the National Security Council staff and as national security adviser to U.S. Vice President George H. W. Bush. He recounts his experiences with insight and humor. While serving as the CIA station chief in Seoul, he opposed the torture employed by the South Korean Central Intelligence Agency during the period of military rule. He twice helped prevent the military-led government from killing Kim Dae-jung, a dissident who later went on to become South Korea’s president and win the Nobel Peace Prize. Gregg offers few details of his work for the CIA, drawing more from his NSC and ambassadorial postings. Throughout, he provides a rich sense of the highs and lows of family and professional life in government service and reflects on the role of personalities in making policy machinery work well (as was sometimes the case in South Korea) or poorly (as was often the case in Vietnam).Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."
10,China Leadership Monitor,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2015-04-20/china-leadership-monitor,China Leadership Monitor,"Before China opened up to the outside world, intelligence analysts and academics used the techniques of “Pekingology” to decode open media sources, where political tensions and policy adjustments were often signaled by subtle shifts in official rhetoric. Despite the wealth of new information sources, that skill is still necessary today, and it is practiced at a high level by the six regular contributors to the China Leadership Monitor,  a quarterly online publication of the Hoover Institution. Each issue tracks the latest developments in Chinese foreign policy, military affairs, economic policy, Communist Party politics, and events in the provinces. In a recent issue, for example, Michael Swaine sorted out the political and economic motives behind Chinese President Xi Jinping’s July 2014 trip to Latin America, Barry Naughton discussed the party’s ambiguous signals on economic reform, and Cheng Li identified 17 officials who have risen to high office thanks to having served in the provinces with Xi."

Thachil studied two districts in India where wealthy backers of the upper-caste-based Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) sought to expand the party’s electoral support by funding one-teacher schools, village health workers, and other simple social services targeted at specific lower castes that had not yet been mobilized by other parties. This approach is different from two other strategies that parties can use to mobilize the poor to vote against their own interests: the use of caste-based or other identity-based appeals (which is possible only for a party that represents the interests of a mass base) and the employment of networks that distribute government welfare benefits selectively (which is possible only for a party that controls at least one level of government). Thachil’s study was conducted before the BJP’s victory in last year’s national elections, so more research will be needed to find out how fully his insight explains the party’s performance, as well as to explore its relevance to the behavior of elite parties in other countries.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

What comes into view is a complex struggle between China and India for influence across the wide arc of land and sea that lies between them. Lintner shows how the tribal and ethnic insurgencies that have smoldered in the area for decades have been shaped by colonial legacies, the Indian government’s violent repression of dissent, and periodic Bangladeshi, Chinese, and Pakistani assistance to insurgent groups. India has supported opposition movements in Bangladesh and has tried to maintain influence in Tibet by supporting the Dalai Lama. China, meanwhile, has cooperated with rebels in Myanmar but has also assisted that country’s government in upgrading its naval facilities on the coast facing India.

But Smith explores several ways in which growing Chinese power has undercut Japanese public support for conciliatory policies toward Beijing. Chinese umbrage at Japan’s Yasukuni Shrine—which honors those who died fighting for the Japanese empire, including a number of convicted war criminals—has made it difficult for Japanese prime ministers to pay their respects to the war dead, whom many Japanese view as honorable patriots. In 2008, a shipment of poisoned dumplings from China sickened at least ten people in Japan and heightened long-standing anxieties about the country’s dependence on imported food. The -ratification by both countries of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea intensified, rather than resolved, disputes over rights to fisheries and undersea oil resources. And the Japanese public has been shocked by the inability of their country’s maritime forces to prevent recent Chinese incursions into Japanese territorial waters. Episodes like these have fed existing fears about the weakness of the Japanese government, generating pressure for a harder stance toward China.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

But unlike other oil-rich Gulf states, such as Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait boasts a vibrant elected National Assembly that fitfully exercises some influence over the country’s monarchy. Herb concludes that the roots of this difference lie in Iraq’s irredentist claim to Kuwait in 1961 and the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990. To shore up its regional and international legitimacy in the face of these threats to its sovereignty, Kuwait fashioned a credible electoral democracy. But no matter how expedient its creation, Kuwait’s National Assembly has become a real force, representing the interests of the publicly employed middle class. The ruling Sabah dynasty is not likely to throttle it, even though it might be tempted to do so.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

Wahhabi clerics, known as the ulama, have been allied and have occasionally intermarried with the tribal House of Saud since the 1740s. In the twentieth century, the clergy went from shunning interaction with many other Muslims, let alone non-Muslims, to engaging with the wider Muslim world—and to some extent with the non-Muslim world as well. On most issues, the political leaders of the kingdom have proved more open than the clergy to change—for example, by introducing the concept of “positive,” human-made law to the legal system. Still, the clergy has always elected to adapt rather than to confront the monarchy, for fear of producing fitna, or dissidence. At the same time, the clergy has never been marginalized, and through the Grand Council of Ulama, it plays a critical role in decision-making on education, the judiciary, public morality, and business and finance. Mouline makes no predictions about the sustainability of this arrangement, but his account makes clear that, even after a few centuries, it remains viable."

But Barnes argues that water scarcity in Egypt is not a “given” but rather “made,” through the interactions of bureaucrats, donors, and consumers. She reveals a perverse imbalance of supply and demand: some regions, such as the Toshka area, have an excess of water, which they literally dump in the desert, while in others, such as Faiyum, water scarcity means that bureaucrats choose winners and losers among farmers. To increase their leverage, farmers employ a variety of tools: forming water-user associations, subleasing reclaimed land in order to gain access to state-supplied irrigation water, and sometimes simply stealing water. Among other fascinating details that Barnes describes is the country’s massive system of underground drains; if laid end to end, the drains would circle the globe multiple times.

17,Inside the Brotherhood,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2015-04-20/inside-brotherhood,Inside the Brotherhood,"The portrait of Egypt’s Muslim Brotherhood that emerges from Kandil’s fascinating and lively book is hardly flattering, highlighting the group’s anti-intellectualism and its emphasis on faith and action over analysis. Before the group came to power in Egypt in 2012, its leadership had long believed that once a community of the faithful formed and won power, government policies and programs would take care of themselves. Small wonder, then, that the democratically elected but short-lived government led by President Mohamed Morsi, who had previously been a Brotherhood leader, proved to be so incompetent. As popular anger against Morsi’s government grew in 2013, the Brotherhood tried to compromise with the army and the security forces, hoping that they could still be won over. Once the army took control, Brotherhood members occupied a square in Cairo to protest, convinced that God would intervene on their behalf. Security forces fired on the demonstration, killing hundreds, and the new regime then outlawed the Brotherhood and arrested all its leaders. Although Kandil laments this “brutal repression,” he clearly thinks that the Brotherhood earned its tribulations.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."
18,Once Upon A Revolution: An Egyptian Story,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2015-04-20/once-upon-revolution-egyptian-story,Once Upon A Revolution: An Egyptian Story,"Cambanis’ remarkable account of Egypt’s 2011 uprising and 2013 counterrevolution is built on his firsthand reporting. Cambanis was in the country during both developments and shared in the initial euphoria and in the bitter disappointment that followed. He tells the story mainly through in-depth profiles of two men: Basem, a middle-aged, secularist architect who became politically active in anger at the almost comically fraudulent 2010 parliamentary elections that confirmed President Hosni Mubarak’s grip on power, and Moaz, a young activist in the Muslim Brotherhood, impatient with the group’s leadership and willing to cooperate with people like Basem. Cambanis’ analysis is sharp, and he does not hold back when it comes to graphically depicting the Egyptian state’s violence against its own people, be they Coptic Christians or Muslim Brotherhood supporters. In his gripping account of the 2011 massacre of some two dozen Copts at a protest in front of the Maspero television building in Cairo, Cambanis squarely blames the violence on the military leadership. Likewise, Cambanis accuses the military of deliberately killing as many Brotherhood supporters as possible during a protest against the 2013 military coup that brought General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi to power. Cambanis claims, at one point, that the lessons of the 2011 uprising cannot be unlearned. But even though the Egyptian people pushed out one autocrat, Sisi’s regime is more authoritarian and less liberal than Mubarak’s. So it’s not altogether clear what the lessons are.

But that would grossly misrepresent what is, in fact, a staggeringly detailed portrait of the city at the heart of Ukraine’s tortured existence. It is not a history of Kiev but rather a walking tour of its sociology. Cybriwsky, a geographer, digs deeply into the city’s secrets and mechanics, exploring its physical features, voices, and “seamy stories.” Some of his knowledge comes from his extensive study of historical and political literature relating to Kiev. But mostly, he draws on insights gained simply by walking and experiencing the city, talking to its people, and watching its daily dramas.

That depiction is cynical and mostly unfounded. But right-wing Ukrainian political parties continue to celebrate the OUN, which lends relevance to this detailed study of the group, its interwar origins in Polish Galicia, and its program and actions during and after the war. Shkandrij dispassionately examines the group’s hyperauthoritarian, antihumanist strain of Ukrainian nationalism, detailing its evolution and tracing the complex ideas and values of the figures who served as the OUN’s intellectual guides. Although the movement spun off democratic variants, its tactics and core ideology reflected a troubling view of violence “as redemptive, as a way of galvanizing a debased mass.” Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

Their Romany language is flecked with words close to Hindi and is spoken in various dialects from Transylvania to San Francisco. To the outside world, they are known as “Gypsies,” with all the romanticism and prejudice that term connotes. But as Matras makes plain in this rich, colorful account, much of what people think they know about the Roma—their proper name, sometimes rendered as Roms—is wrong. Some Roma move about in caravans, but the vast majority are sedentary. Far from the sensuous Gypsy women of lore, Romany women live according to norms of extreme modesty. Romany attitudes toward cleanliness are far stricter than the attitudes in the wider societies that the Roma interact with at arm’s length. Matras, a professor of linguistics, punctures the distorted images of Roma and probes Romany beliefs and opinions about everything from gender roles, age, and work to marriage, shame, and religion.

Now, they see it as not merely a factor in dysfunctional economies but also a potential source of extremist violence and terrorism. For her part, McMann looks at how corruption figures in the daily lives of people struggling to meet their basic needs in the turmoil of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Uzbekistan, societies moving from Soviet-style economies to market-based ones. This is not the voluptuous venality of high officials and heavy rollers manipulating laws and regulations but rather, as she says, “petty corruption”—the small bribes, favors, and paid-for votes offered by the average person to get a modest loan, a job, or money for food, housing, or health care. Relying on a wealth of survey and interview data, she makes an intriguing argument: ordinary people in these countries engage in corruption only as “a last resort,” after losing alternative sources of support, such as the government, charitable organizations, social groups, or family—losses that often occur when economic reform takes place in the absence of strong institutions.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

Nothing about him suggested the capacity for the fierce ethnic nationalism, violence, and sadism that swept him to power as the leader of the Serbian Democratic Party and then president of the Republika Srpska, an enclave carved by force out of Bosnia and Herzegovina. But from 1992 to 1995, he orchestrated, in both idea and deed, a military campaign that took 100,000 lives—most of them Bosnian Muslims, many of whom were killed in atrocities that led the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia to indict Karadzic on charges of genocide. After 13 years on the run, he was arrested and brought before the ICTY in 2008. Donia testified as an expert witness during the trial and had the extraordinary experience of being cross-examined by Karadzic. (The court has yet to issue a verdict.) The sense of Karadzic that Donia gained from that encounter contributes to an elegantly written biography of a complex, charismatic figure who “thought creatively and acted ruthlessly in realizing, at any cost, a utopian vision of a separate state controlled and inhabited only by Serbs.” Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

The growing gap in power, the historical sources of enmity, and the cultural divide make it impossible, the thinking goes. But those assumptions ought to be reconsidered. The evolving, multidimensional nature of national identity under Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin, Rozman argues, is bringing the two countries together in profound ways. Both regimes have tapped into deep historical and cultural sensitivities, fashioned updated versions of authoritarianism that celebrate the state, proclaimed a sense of alienation from Western values, and engaged in the “demonization of the United States.” Rozman recognizes that Chinese and Russians leaders might overreach and that events might send their currently parallel quests for identity onto disparate paths. But he doubts that the core similarities, including the residual influence of communism, will soon fade, and he suspects that stronger ties between Beijing and Moscow will pose a challenge to the West’s preferred world order.

The story is pure Hollywood—and indeed, a film based on the book was released last year. But it is not all uplift: Davis deftly juxtaposes the team’s success with the political backlash faced by undocumented immigrants all over the country. Nor is the story a clear testament to the transformative power of education. A decade after the competition, some of the U.S. citizens who were runners-up in the contest now hold jobs at NASA and Exxon. The undocumented winners have not fared as well: one is a janitor, another is a cook, and a third spent a year picking beans in Mexico before finally gaining U.S. citizenship. The specter of deportation haunts them and their families, just as it will continue to haunt all undocumented children in the United States as long as the U.S. Congress fails to pass the Dream Act, which would grant permanent residency to many of those who were brought to the United States as children and know no other home."

27,Venezuela: What Everyone Needs to Know,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2015-04-20/venezuela-what-everyone-needs-know,Venezuela: What Everyone Needs to Know,"For much of the second half of the twentieth century, Venezuela was one of Latin America’s few bastions of democracy and stability. Today, with inflation soaring and protests mounting, instability seems inevitable, and the country is on edge. How did this happen? In this broad, accessible overview of the country’s political history, Salas finds the roots of most, but not all, of today’s problems in the rule of Hugo Chávez, who served as Venezuela’s president from 1999 until his death in 2013. Salas recounts how during an economic slump brought on by low oil prices at the end of the 1990s, Chávez boldly set the country on a new footing. In 1999, he called for a new constitution, and he subsequently spearheaded new regional alliances that excluded the United States. Not surprisingly, Chávez’s policies deeply polarized Venezuelan society and provoked multiple attempts by the opposition to remove Chávez from power, ranging from an attempted military coup in 2002, to oil strikes, to a failed recall referendum in 2004. But Salas also finds much to applaud in Chávez’s project to revolutionize Venezuela: for example, the sharp decline in poverty rates between 2002 and 2010 and the success of various programs aimed at improving health, literacy, and housing. As he sees it, the main problem is that Chávez’s “Bolivarian Revolution” was not sufficiently institutionalized. Chávez’s death, along with a severe drop in oil prices and the lackluster performance of Chávez’s handpicked successor, Nicolás Maduro, has left the country adrift."
28,The Precision Agriculture Revolution,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2015-04-20/precision-agriculture-revolution,The Precision Agriculture Revolution,"Thousands of years ago, agriculture began as a highly site-specific activity. The first farmers were gardeners who nurtured individual plants, and they sought out the microclimates and patches of soil that favored those plants. But as farmers acquired scientific knowledge and mechanical expertise, they enlarged their plots, using standardized approaches—plowing the soil, spreading animal manure as fertilizer, rotating the crops from year to year—to boost crop yields. Over the years, they developed better methods of preparing the soil and protecting plants from insects and, eventually, machines to reduce the labor required. Starting in the nineteenth century, scientists invented chemical pesticides and used newly discovered genetic principles to select for more productive plants. Even though these methods maximized overall productivity, they led some areas within fields to underperform. Nonetheless, yields rose to once-unimaginable levels: for some crops, they increased tenfold from the nineteenth century to the present."
29,Europe Entrapped,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2015-04-20/europe-entrapped,Europe Entrapped,"Offe is a venerable figure in European sociology. His take on the current state of the EU is unfailingly intelligent but lightly documented, and his analysis depends to a large extent on a selective reading of secondary sources that agree with his own position. Still, his book clearly reveals how European social democrats, such as himself, face a difficult dilemma. On the one hand, they understand better than anyone that the euro fundamentally constrains the ability of states to provide the welfare spending and broad economic growth essential to left-wing goals. Yet their pro-EU ideals prevent them from turning against the euro—a task that social democrats have left to more extreme parties, whose opposition to the common currency has won them a great deal of public support. Offe’s way out is to propose a series of radical EU-level solutions, such as pan-European taxation, social welfare spending, and citizenship. His prescriptions are instructive not because they are likely to be either feasible or effective but because they are so typical of what many on the European left believe today."
30,The Uncertain Legacy of Crisis: European Foreign Policy Faces the Future,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2015-04-20/uncertain-legacy-crisis-european-foreign-policy-faces-future,The Uncertain Legacy of Crisis: European Foreign Policy Faces the Future,"Jacques Delors, the legendary president of the European Commission, used to say, “Never let a crisis go to waste.” In the spirit of Delors’ adage, Youngs has penned this book on how Europe can restore its global influence, which has taken a hit during the ongoing eurozone crisis. The general impression Youngs leaves is that the crisis has not undermined European power as much as it seems. Much of his advice is sensible. Europe should spend less energy fiddling with its internal institutions and trying to replicate EU norms elsewhere and more energy investing in traditional multilateral institutions. It should also focus on more concrete objectives, such as the defense of global economic openness and European cooperation with rising Asian powers. The book also rightly downplays the importance of military force as an instrument of modern international power projection."

It begins in ancient Greece and continues all the way to speculations about Europe’s financial future. Dyson finds continuities across the millennia. Economic interdependence has meant that creditors have always had more bargaining power than debtors, a fact that is encoded in economic institutions and ideas; historically, debtors have had to accede to creditors’ demands. The willingness of states to incur debt nonetheless typically results from pressing priorities such as war, reconstruction, or demands for social welfare. Yet the most interesting constants throughout European financial history are the pervasive illusions and misunderstandings that befall every generation. Over and over again, market participants and observers mislead themselves into believing that they fully understand the true nature of credit and debt and mistake the parochial positions they take as creditors or debtors for moral standards. The resulting hubris and self-delusion often wreak havoc, particularly for the economically disadvantaged."
32,The Power of Inaction: Bank Bailouts in Comparison,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2015-04-20/power-inaction-bank-bailouts-comparison,The Power of Inaction: Bank Bailouts in Comparison,"Most analyses of the 2008 financial crisis advocate various technocratic solutions but say little about the politics of putting them in place. That’s not the case with this pathbreaking book, which focuses on the political questions that really matter: Who ends up paying to clean up a crisis, and why? Woll asks why some governments have been much better than others at bailing out their banks. Some countries, such as France and Denmark, have kept the costs of bailouts low and have distributed the costs fairly between the public and the private sector, thereby shortening and softening the economic effects of the crisis. Others, such as Germany, the United Kingdom, and most notably Ireland, have let bailout costs balloon and have imposed them on the public sector alone, with disastrous consequences. The United States is somewhere in the middle. One might think that the key to success would be to have a strong government and state bureaucracy. In fact, the crucial factor is the nature of a country’s financial sector: the more coherent and organized it is, the more efficient and fair a bailout will be. Private-sector coordination permits banks to spread costs evenly; without it, banks start to duck paying their fair share, and ultimately no one is left to pay except the state. Woll’s original analysis is a must-read for anyone who seeks the deeper economic lessons of the past five years."

Adams had three big strategic ideas. The first was neutrality. Informed by his education and early diplomatic experiences abroad, Adams saw that the United States was at once materially weak and ideologically threatening to European powers. To protect its fragile unity, the country had to steer clear of foreign entanglements. The second big idea was national defense. As secretary of state under President James Monroe, from 1817 to 1825, Adams supported territorial expansion and insisted that Washington unilaterally issue the Monroe Doctrine, which opposed any European intervention in the Western Hemisphere, rather than take that position as part of an alliance with the United Kingdom. This strategic posture overstated U.S. capabilities at the time, but also deftly preserved a free hand for further American expansion. Adams, however, was more than a calculating realist, and his third big idea was liberty. After serving as president from 1825 to 1829, Adams won election to the House of Representatives in 1831, where he opposed the expansion of slavery to new territories and anticipated a time when American ideals would merge with U.S. power to “unsettle all the ancient governments of Europe.” Today’s free Europe is the true legacy of Adams’ grand strategy. As Edel concedes, Adams’ personal and political inflexibility sometimes impeded his ideas, especially during his presidency. But the ideas endured."

This is partly because of the sheer scale of the conflict (more Americans were killed in it than in all other U.S. wars combined) and partly because the issues at its core—race relations and the nature and power of the federal government—remain central to American political life."

Grenier’s book is the most recent addition to the genre and one of the more valuable ones. As the CIA station chief in Islamabad during that period, Grenier was closely involved in U.S. efforts to hunt down Osama bin Laden, defeat the Taliban, and set up a viable state in Afghanistan. His book illuminates the intricacy of the area’s politics and provides some interesting characterizations of players on both sides of the porous Afghan-Pakistani border, including the Afghan leader Hamid Karzai. He conveys the frustrations of intelligence work, in which nobody ever quite tells the truth or is quite sure about the meaning of success, and also the exasperation that intelligence officers feel when their governments oversimplify complex situations or lose interest whenever a new issue grabs their attention. The last section of the book offers a mournful commentary on how badly things went during the U.S. wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, as the twists and turns of political sentiment in Washington stymied the development of durable policies."

Krepinevich and Watts, two of Marshall’s close associates, have written an interesting examination of Marshall’s role in shaping American thinking on key defense issues: the potential vulnerability of U.S. strategic bases to a surprise Soviet nuclear attack, the burden of the defense sector on the Soviet economy, the so-called revolution in military affairs that might (or might not) have taken place during the 1990s, and the rise of China. But the authors shed little light on the meaning and methodology of “net assessment”; readers might conclude that it simply means that Marshall spent a lot of time worrying about threats. Marshall was unquestionably a giant in the field, and yet somehow he appears to have said very little and left few traces of his contributions. This helps explain his professional durability, but it also makes him a frustrating subject for an intellectual biography."
37,The Amazons: Lives and Legends of Warrior Women Across the Ancient World,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2015-04-20/amazons-lives-and-legends-warrior-women-across-ancient-world,The Amazons: Lives and Legends of Warrior Women Across the Ancient World,"The Amazons, ferocious warrior women, have long been assumed to be little more than a compelling myth of the ancient Greeks—a fantasy concocted by men who in real life probably preferred to keep women in domestic subservience. But it turns out that the Greeks almost certainly did confront women from the Central Asian steppes who fought on horseback and came from a nomadic society in which men and women shared essential tasks. The popular notion that these women cut off a breast so that they could more easily wield an archer’s bow appears to be apocryphal: after all, women can fire arrows perfectly well without drastic surgery. In her quest to separate reality from mythology, Mayor left few stones unturned, even examining the graves of women with war wounds and mummified tattoos. She skillfully presents her findings with wit and conviction in this superbly illustrated book. And in a final section, she shows that female warriors have  in fact made frequent appearances  at other times and places in history,  in locations as distinct as China and Egypt."

Hoping to get past superficial parallels, two groups of scholars have delved deeply into past crises to find out if there are indeed any lessons that might apply today."
39,Ministers at War: Winston Churchill and His War Cabinet,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2015-04-20/ministers-war-winston-churchill-and-his-war-cabinet,Ministers at War: Winston Churchill and His War Cabinet,"Schneer has pulled off quite a feat: he has said something original about Winston Churchill as a wartime leader and has done so in a lively and readable book. The basic story—of how the United Kingdom’s coalition government formed in 1940 and how it held together until the Allies defeated Germany—is familiar. But Schneer’s telling makes the tale fresh, owing to his compelling portraits of Churchill’s cabinet members and his emphasis on the importance of postwar planning. The story features some remarkable characters, such as the imperialist Lord Beaverbrook, who became the fiercest advocate of mounting a second front to support the Soviet Union, and the austere socialist Sir Richard Stafford Cripps, who at one point during the war seemed poised to mount a credible threat to Churchill’s leadership. Schneer stresses the vital contributions that Labour members of the cabinet made and highlights Churchill’s skill in managing such a disparate group. His account also helps explain why Churchill lost his post in 1945, despite his personal popularity: British voters wanted a strong welfare state and feared that a Churchill victory would mean a return to the Conservatives’ less generous pre-war social policies."
40,Perspectives on Dodd-Frank and Finance,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2015-04-20/perspectives-dodd-frank-and-finance,Perspectives on Dodd-Frank and Finance,"The 2008 financial crisis left governments all over the world scrambling to put in place better regulations. In the United States, the main result was the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, a massive piece of legislation whose text runs to some 1,500 pages. It has proved difficult for everyone, including even the legislators who crafted the law, to understand what it says, much less comprehend all its ramifications. This useful volume examines the principal objectives of Dodd-Frank and its main provisions and also identifies some important things that were omitted from the law—some deliberately, others not. The book presents a fairly wide range of critiques of Dodd-Frank, some more sympathetic than others. It focuses exclusively on the United States, but developments there have had implications for other countries, given the interconnectivity of major financial institutions around the world."

What will happen if no global agreement emerges to limit greenhouse gas emissions? And what will be the likely impact of climate change on economies and societies? Wagner and Weitzman focus on several low-probability but high-cost outcomes, such as a rise in average surface temperature of six degrees, rather than the 2.5- or 3-degree increase that more conservative estimates foresee. They argue that governments should do what they can now to avoid the most devastating outcomes, even if they are less likely, and suggest as a model the kind of worst-case planning that sometimes informs national security policies and budgets. The book combines sophisticated analysis with a breezy, informal style, relying (not always convincingly) on analogies rather than equations to drive home its points."

But even people who live in cities need to eat, so agricultural productivity must increase. Drawing on a lifetime of experience in developing countries, Timmer clearly describes the vital role that agricultural transformation plays in structural economic change, the risks involved, and the pitfalls to avoid. The process of shifting away from agriculture has happened in countries all over the world, sometimes smoothly, sometimes not. Governments have helped the process but have also hindered it, often in the name of food security: to reduce hunger in rural areas, officials have subsidized farmers or protected them against imports, even though doing so often impedes development and prolongs poverty. Timmer worries that a rush to shift the focus of agriculture from growing food to producing biofuels might prevent the doubling of food production that must occur over the next four decades to meet the needs of growing populations and changing diets."
43,Following Oil; Market Madness,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2015-04-20/following-oil-market-madness,Following Oil; Market Madness,"These two timely books on global oil markets, both written by financial analysts, are formally quite different. Petrie’s is more personal, even autobiographical, and emphasizes people, firms, and financial markets; Clayton’s is more scholarly, covers a much longer period of time, and focuses more specifically on the oil business. Still, both books make the same central point: the specific factors that drive the oil sector’s booms and busts vary, but the underlying dynamic does not change much. Markets expect high prices to last, leading to more conservation, new exploration, and technical innovations. In time, those factors overcome the apparent scarcity and even result in periods of overabundance. Then the cycle reverses, as consumption increases and exploration falls. Although both books were finished before the sharp drop in oil prices that began in mid-2014, their implicit message still applies: this too shall pass."

But unlike the MDGs, which consisted of eight specific, succinctly expressed targets, the SDGs currently involve 169 targets that require more than 4,000 words to describe. Lomborg argues that the program must be more focused. If the past decade is any guide, trillions of dollars of foreign assistance will be available in the next 15 years—a large, but not unlimited, amount. Lomborg urges that it be used to maximize the benefits to humankind. To that end, he convened panels of experts to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of each proposal. They found that some of the goals are highly cost effective—for example, reducing import barriers to agricultural products and assuring that all children have adequate access to early childhood care and preprimary education. But the estimated costs of other goals would outweigh their likely benefits—for example, assuring that all young adults have access to affordable, high-quality education and substantially increasing the share of renewables in the global energy market."

Ambition, fear, and risk taking tend to intensify, often leading to war. In this important study, Kliman argues that some power transitions are more dangerous than others, depending on the political character of the states involved. The most peaceful transitions, Kliman contends, have been between democracies. When faced with an ascendant autocratic state, leading democracies have tended to pursue hedging and balancing strategies, and sometimes containment—think of the United States facing growing Soviet power after World War II. When confronted by a rising fellow democracy, powerful democratic countries have tended to pursue appeasement and other more accommodating strategies—think of the British response to the rise of the United States after World War I. Kliman argues that since democracies share values and have more transparent political institutions, they find it easier to establish trust, whereas because autocratic states obscure their intentions and strive to keep out foreign influences, conflict is more likely. The book does not offer good news for the management of the U.S.-Chinese power transition, although it suggests that American relations with India and other rising non-Western democracies might fare better."

In the years prior to World War I, many held a similarly sanguine view about Europe; such optimists soon learned that rationality was not the constraint on violence they believed it to be. As Coker explains, ideology and emotional appeals to “national purpose” have just as much influence on states as sober cost-benefit assessments of the national interest. He stops short of predicting a Sino-American, but he convincingly argues that the rise of China will be as disruptive to the U.S.-led international order as the rise of Germany after 1870 was to the British-led order of that era. China will want to rewrite the rules of the system and reassert its place in Asia, and the United States will inevitably resist. Deep cultural and ideological divides between China and the United States will make a peaceful power transition even more difficult. What worries Coker most is intellectual complacency. If leaders in Beijing and Washington think war is impossible, they will not do the hard work of overcoming the mistrust and antagonism generated by their conflicting interests, worldviews, and values."

Chayes argues that Afghanistan is not a failed or failing state but rather a “vertically integrated criminal syndicate” that operates according to its own perverse political logic. Its objective is to enrich the ruling elite. Her argument is not that Afghan society or culture is intrinsically corrupt. But as it currently exists, the Afghan system makes the rule of law and honest government impossible. Chayes points to diplomatic, financial, and intelligence tools that outsiders could use to fight extreme corruption, but the challenge seems overwhelming. Indeed, U.S. and European military and humanitarian officials understand the problem, but more often than not, they end up as enablers of the corruption, working through intermediaries who are themselves part of the racket. Still, at various points, Chayes refers to classic political thinkers—Machiavelli, most notably—to make an essential and somewhat more optimistic point: corruption is the natural temptation of rulers, but it is often what ultimately brings them down."

According to Posen, U.S. liberals and neoconservatives both see a multitude of threats facing their country that call for elaborate American-led efforts at security cooperation and power projection. In their view, Washington must remain the world’s dominant military power, build alliances, deploy forces around the world, manage global institutions, and be ready to intervene anywhere to ensure stability and promote liberal democracy. But Posen advances a much narrower, classical realist definition of U.S. security interests: sovereignty, territorial integrity, and the safety of the homeland. The liberal hegemonic order is built around Washington’s ability and willingness to enforce global rules and protect allies, but Posen argues that this undertaking is too costly and unsustainable. Yet how does one determine the proper price of “stability” or determine if the presence of U.S. forces in Asia and Europe prevents costly wars or provides Washington with political influence in other policy areas? Posen’s strong argument is that this dependence on U.S. power increases Washington’s propensity to make costly mistakes. But in the absence of a system that relies on Washington for stability, what would discipline American power and prevent the United States from pursuing self-destructive ideological crusades or risky overseas adventures? The trouble is that what Posen is proposing is really a strategy of disengagement, which comes with its own dangers. In reality, a more restrained United States would be one that is even more deeply bound to the international community through its leadership of global institutions and alliances."

Last year, the country’s GDP growth rate fell to 7.4 percent, the lowest in almost a quarter century, and many expect that figure to drop further in 2015. Plenty of countries struggle to grow at even this pace, but most don’t have to create hundreds of millions of jobs over the next decade, as China will. So understandably, some experts are skeptical about the country’s prospects. They argue that its production-fueled growth model is no longer tenable and warn, as the economist Paul Krugman did in 2013, that the country is “about to hit its Great Wall.” According to this view, the question is not whether the Chinese economy will crash but when."

The key to its success lies in what one might call “authoritarian adaptation”—the use of policy reforms to substitute for fundamental institutional change. Under Deng Xiaoping, this meant reforming agriculture and unleashing entrepreneurship. Under Jiang Zemin, it meant officially enshrining a market economy, reforming state-owned enterprises, and joining the World Trade Organization. Under Hu Jintao and Wen Jiabao, it meant reforming social security. Many expect yet another round of sweeping reforms under Xi Jinping—but they may be disappointed."

This conviction was hardly surprising, since Europe has often played a central role in global affairs. For much of the last three centuries, European order was world order—a product of the interests, ambitions, and rivalries of the continent’s empires. And even during the Cold War, when the new superpowers stood on opposite sides of the continent, the central struggle was between two European ideologies, democratic capitalism and communism, and over control of the European lands in between."

Surrounded by policy advisers and members of the Politburo, Hu asked them how China should respond to the inevitable spillover.

Over the past 65 years, life expectancy in China has more than doubled, from 35 years to roughly 75, as the fertility rate has plunged. Many fear that if these trends continue, China’s population will age faster than the country can accommodate. In 2014, the share of China’s population older than 60 reached roughly 15 percent; demographers predict that figure will double by 2050, reaching the equivalent of nearly 450 million people, or about one-quarter of the world’s elderly. Over the same period, China’s median age will skyrocket, from roughly 35 to 46. China, some experts say, is in for a shock: As more and more people age out of their working years, the country’s economic productivity will plummet. And as its growth slows, China will find itself without the money and resources to provide for its elderly, who will become a financial burden."

55,Xi’s Corruption Crackdown,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/china/xis-corruption-crackdown,Xi’s Corruption Crackdown,"In a series of speeches he delivered shortly after taking office in 2012, Chinese President Xi Jinping cast corruption as not merely a significant problem for his country but an existential threat. Endemic corruption, he warned, could lead to “the collapse of the [Chinese Communist] Party and the downfall of the state.” For the past two years, Xi has carried out a sweeping, highly publicized anticorruption campaign. In terms of sheer volume, the results have been impressive: according to official statistics, the party has punished some 270,000 of its cadres for corrupt activities, reaching into almost every part of the government and every level of China’s vast bureaucracy. The most serious offenders have been prosecuted and imprisoned; some have even been sentenced to death."
56,China’s Race Problem,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/china/chinas-race-problem,China’s Race Problem,"For all the tremendous change China has experienced in recent decades—phenomenal economic growth, improved living standards, and an ascent to great-power status—the country has made little progress when it comes to the treatment of its ethnic minorities, most of whom live in China’s sparsely populated frontier regions. This is by no means a new problem. Indeed, one of those regions, Tibet, represents one of the “three Ts”—taboo topics that the Chinese government has long forbidden its citizens to discuss openly. (The other two are Taiwan and the Tiananmen Square uprising of 1989.)"
57,Protecting America’s Competitive Advantage,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/protecting-america-s-competitive-advantage,Protecting America’s Competitive Advantage,"Two months from now, the U.S. Congress may shutter a government agency that, in the past six years, has supported more than 1.3 million American jobs and generated more than $2 billion in deficit-reducing profits. The Export-Import Bank of the United States empowers American exporters by equipping those that cannot access private financing with credit insurance and working capital, among other tools."
58,Drone On,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/drone,Drone On,"In the beginning, drones were almost exclusively the province of militaries. At first little more than remote-controlled model planes used in the World War I era, military drones advanced steadily over the decades, eventually becoming sophisticated tools that could surveil battlefield enemies from the sky. Today, the terms “drone” and “unmanned aircraft system” denote a vehicle that navigates through the air from point A to point B and is either remotely controlled or flies autonomously. While they vary in size and shape, such vehicles all feature a communications link, intelligent software, sensors or cameras, a power source, and a method of mobility (usually propellers)."
59,The Democratization of Space,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/space/2015-04-20/democratization-space,The Democratization of Space,"Starting with the Soviets’ launch of Sputnik in 1957, early space missions were funded exclusively by national governments, and for good reason: going to space was astronomically expensive. Setting up a successful space program meant making major investments in expertise and infrastructure, along with tolerating a great deal of risk—which only the superpowers could do. NASA’s Apollo program, for instance, employed 400,000 people, cost more than $110 billion in today’s dollars, and resulted in the death of three skilled astronauts. Not surprisingly, then, the legal framework that developed as the space race intensified was government-centric. In 1967, the United States, the Soviet Union, and many other countries signed the Outer Space Treaty, which set up a framework for managing activities in space—usually defined as beginning 62 miles above sea level. The treaty established national governments as the parties responsible for governing space, a principle that remains in place today."
60,In Defense of Financial Innovation,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2015-03-05/defense-financial-innovation,In Defense of Financial Innovation,"At a 2013 conference held by The Economist in New York, business and policy leaders debated whether talented university graduates should join Google or Goldman Sachs. Vivek Wadhwa, a serial entrepreneur, spoke up for Google. “Would you rather have your children engineering the financial system [and] creating more problems for us, or having a chance of saving the world?” he asked. He had a much easier time pitching his case than Robert Shiller, the Nobel Prize–winning economist who advocated for Goldman Sachs by arguing that every human activity, even saving the world, had to be financed. No use; in the end, the audience voted heavily in favor of Mountain View and against Wall Street."
61,From Calvin to the Caliphate,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/western-europe/2015-04-20/calvin-caliphate,From Calvin to the Caliphate,"Nearly a century after it first emerged in Egypt, political Islam is redefining the Muslim world. Also called Islamism, this potent ideology holds that the billion-strong global Muslim community would be free and great if only it were pious—that is, if Muslims lived under state-enforced Islamic law, or sharia, as they have done for most of Islamic history. Islamists have long been confronted by Muslims who reject sharia and by non-Muslims who try to get them to reject it. At times benign and at times violent, these confrontations have fueled the revolutions in Egypt in 1952 and Iran in 1979, the al Qaeda attacks in 2001, the Arab Spring of 2011, and the rise of radical Islamist groups such as the self-proclaimed Islamic State (also known as ISIS)."

63,The Real Challenge in the Pacific,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/asia/2015-04-20/real-challenge-pacific,The Real Challenge in the Pacific,"In past years, Andrew Krepinevich, Jr., has argued for a U.S. military operational concept in the Pacific theater called “Air-Sea Battle.” This concept relies heavily on preemptive deep strikes in the early stages of a conflict and would have been highly escalatory. Perhaps implicitly recognizing the costs and risks of such an approach, Krepinevich now offers up a replacement he calls “Archipelagic Defense” (“How to Deter China,” March/April 2015). This approach would “deny China the ability to control the air and the sea around the first island chain,” largely through the deployment of U.S. and allied ground forces and supporting military assets, including antiaircraft, antimissile, and antisubmarine capabilities. Arrayed in areas from Japan to the Philippines, these measures are necessary, he argues, because Beijing is committed to a strategy of coercion and intimidation designed to exclude the United States from the western Pacific and eventually lead to China’s dominating the region."
64,Return the Marbles,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/greece/2015-04-20/return-marbles,Return the Marbles,"James Cuno (“Culture War,” November/ December 2014) makes an unpersuasive argument against the repatriation of museum artifacts to their countries of origin. Certainly, as Cuno writes, encyclopedic museums broaden our understanding of the historical interplay among cultures. But he goes too far when he flatly dismisses countries’ claims to historical objects as “frivolous” and overly nationalist. He too easily brushes aside the moral case for returning objects to the countries in which they were first unearthed—and, in particular, he is too quick to dismiss Greece’s case for the repatriation of the Elgin Marbles."
65,Not Ordinary Russians,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/russian-federation/2015-04-20/not-ordinary-russians,Not Ordinary Russians,"In her review of my book No Illusions: The Voices of Russia’s Future Leaders, Sarah Mendelson (“Generation Putin,” January/February 2015) wrongly criticizes my research methods. She writes that random-sample surveys would have added more information to the focus groups of Russian students on which I based my book. But as any social scientist will tell you, mass surveys might tell you what people think, but focus groups are much better at revealing why they think it. My research for the book was about a particular group of young elite Russians, the country’s likely future leaders, not average Russians; the latter may be suited to mass surveys, but the former are not. For data about opinions and attitudes that are representative of all of Russia, readers can—and should—look elsewhere."
66,Too Many Secrets,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/0015-04-20/too-many-secrets,Too Many Secrets,One of the most persistent challenges of U.S. national security policy is balancing  the short-term benefits of secrecy with the long-term benefits of openness. Government agencies responsible for dealing with national security threats will often be more effective if they are allowed to keep certain details about their activities secret. But openness is not just a cherished American value; it is a core element of American strength. Government officials who ignore this fact and insist on secrecy whenever it seems convenient will serve their agencies and their country poorly.

68,Cloudy Outlook,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/cloudy-outlook,Cloudy Outlook,"In their analysis of the rapid growth of solar power worldwide, Dickon Pinner and Matt Rogers (“Solar Power Comes of Age,” March/April 2015) write that “solar power is ready to compete on its own terms.” But a broader view of the facts suggests that the story of solar power’s growth isn’t quite as sunny as they claim."

70,Putin’s Hard Turn,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/2015-04-20/putins-hard-turn,Putin’s Hard Turn,"For many who arrived in Moscow in recent decades, the city had an almost narcotic effect. In the vacuum created by the Soviet collapse, unabashed opportunism and a limitless sense of the possible became the closest thing the wounded country had to a collective ideology. There were few consequences and everything was pretend—except, of course, for the massive sums of money. And as long as Russia, after Vladimir Putin took power in 2000, kept up its winking nod toward modernization and democracy, it was easy enough to play along without too much of a drag on your conscience."
71,What Caused Capitalism?,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/review-essay/what-caused-capitalism,What Caused Capitalism?,"Once upon a time, smart people thought the world was flat. As globalization took off, economists pointed to spreading market forces that allowed consumers to buy similar things for the same prices around the world. Others invoked the expansion of liberalism and democracy after the Cold War. For a while, it seemed as if the West’s political and economic ways really had won out."
72,Warning Signs,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/middle-east/2015-04-20/warning-signs,Warning Signs,"Intelligence analysts have labored for years to identify the factors that make countries unstable. For those wanting to anticipate the next failed state, Nassim Nicholas Taleb and Gregory Treverton (“The Calm Before the Storm,” January/February 2015) offer a counterintuitive insight: “Disorderly regimes come out as safer bets than commonly thought—and seemingly placid states turn out to be ticking time bombs.” But the authors fail to support that claim, and their proposed method for assessing a state’s fragility does not appear to offer anything better than the early warning methods already in use."

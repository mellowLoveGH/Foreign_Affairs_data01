But the closer we looked, the more we realized that one big thing -- shale -- loomed above the rest. So we decided the occasion called for hedgehogs rather than foxes, and curated the package accordingly."
1,Commerce With the Universe; Afro-Jewish Encounters,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2014-04-21/commerce-universe-afro-jewish-encounters,Commerce With the Universe; Afro-Jewish Encounters,"Both of these books refute simplistic conventional portraits of the relationship between Africa and the rest of the word, which tend to suggest that the region was exposed to outside influences only as a result of European colonialism. Desai’s book relates the rich history of the relationship between South Asia and East Africa, which began with commercial links that stretch back as far as the Middle Ages. Through an analysis of a number of little-known or underappreciated literary texts, Desai assesses the impact of South Asian minorities on East Africa and the syncretic culture that has emerged owing to their presence. Desai’s savvy take on the nature of identity in diaspora populations presents readers with a new way to understand the culture of modern East Africa. Commerce plays an important role in his story, and many of the works he analyzes exhibit an interesting form of liberalism, portraying the free market as tempering the actions of the state, which often comes across as hostile or at least untrustworthy."
2,Good Growth and Governance in Africa; Governance for Development in Africa,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2014-04-20/good-growth-and-governance-africa-governance-development-africa,Good Growth and Governance in Africa; Governance for Development in Africa,"These two books reflect the emerging conventional wisdom within the international community that aid donors have overemphasized the importance of improving governance in the poor countries of Africa and that democratization in the region has actually hampered economic growth. The widespread embrace of these views is a bit surprising, considering that the last two decades in Africa have witnessed both significant democratization and the fastest economic growth since the end of the colonial era. Still, both books contend that democracy is bad for growth in low-income states, and both insist that Africa’s recent economic successes have not produced the kind of transformation the region needs. Finally, both argue that the recent past in Asia offers lessons for Africa, especially about the need to focus less on democratic reforms and fighting corruption and more on top-down development policies, which, they contend, offer a better chance of leading to economic success."
3,Congo: The Epic History of a People,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2014-04-21/congo-epic-history-people,Congo: The Epic History of a People,"A major critical and popular success in Belgium, this sweeping history of Congo begins during the precolonial era and brings readers all the way up to the current era of warlords and civil war. Van Reybrouck’s carefully researched and elegantly written book takes in the reader with compelling portraits of ordinary people that enrich what would otherwise be a fairly conventional historical narrative. The book’s best chapters focus on Belgian colonialism and the decolonization process. Van Reybrouck eschews a Manichaean view and instead paints a nuanced portrait of the successes and dismal failures of the colonial period. Under Belgian rule, Congo achieved one of the highest literacy rates in Africa. Yet when the country finally won its independence, in 1960, its citizens included only 16 college graduates and not a single medical doctor. Van Reybrouck’s analysis of the political crises of the early 1960s focuses mostly on the power struggles among leading Congolese politicians and is too perfunctory when it comes to the international dimensions of the fight for control of the country. The engaging final chapters, which cover the period since the fall of the Mobutu regime in 1997, are built on highly personal accounts of Van Reybrouck’s travels through the war-torn country and are more impressionistic and less precise than the book’s historical chapters.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."
4,Restless China,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2014-04-21/restless-china,Restless China,"For more than three decades, the combination of the dismantling of socialist economic institutions and rapid growth has fundamentally transformed the lives of China’s citizens. Although in most respects, they have benefited from improved living standards, greater cultural diversity, and heightened contacts with the outside world, the scale and jarring speed of the changes have left many wondering, as the editors of this timely volume put it, “What does it mean now to be Chinese?” This is the third volume of essays on new trends in Chinese society and culture produced by the same editorial team. The dozen essays cover such varied topics as how rich entrepreneurs bribe local officials while at the same time preparing to escape abroad, just in case; how Chinese Internet users invent clever new Chinese characters to outwit the country’s Internet police; popular responses to mass accidents and food-safety scandals; controversies provoked by a popular television dating show; and the resurgence of faith healing and other forms of ecstatic religion. The coverage is necessarily selective -- rural Chinese and urban migrants receive little attention -- but anyone wishing to get a sense of the popular ferment that lies beneath the rapid growth and strict political controls emphasized in daily headlines will find much of value in this book.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."
5,Shaping the Emerging World: India and the Multilateral Order,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2014-04-21/shaping-emerging-world-india-and-multilateral-order,Shaping the Emerging World: India and the Multilateral Order,"Multilateral regimes are increasingly important in regulating how states relate to one another, but India’s engagement has been hampered by its focus on its immediate regional security problems, its continuing commitment to “strategic autonomy,” its complex and inward-looking domestic politics, and even a shortage of diplomatic personnel. India has lobbied for permanent membership in the UN Security Council but has kept the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund at arm’s length, has placed obstacles in the way of trade agreements and climate negotiations, and has avoided international arms control commitments. The contributors to this volume explore India’s positions on those issues and others, including UN peacekeeping, the law of the sea, cybersecurity, financial accounting, and human rights. They reveal a pattern of ambivalence, shaped by a desire, on the one hand, for major-power status and a fear, on the other, of seeing international norms turned against India’s interests. New Delhi tends to favor multilateral institutions that can be used to constrain the actions of other major powers but not those that might be employed to influence India itself.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

The volumes show Tibet as part of world history, not apart from it. The chronological structures of both books reveal a society that has never been static: a turbulent mix of cultures, clans, dialects, religious lineages, and forms of rule, with a creative center that has both received and exerted cultural influence in its relations with China, India, Iran, Mongolia, and Russia."

Osburg, an American anthropologist, spent time with and observed successful Chinese businessmen in Sichuan’s capital city, Chengdu. These men seem to devote most of their time to cultivating relationships with government officials and gang bosses in teahouses, karaoke parlors, and banqueting clubs. They enact rituals of male bonding that require the conspicuous consumption of expensive cars, exotic food and drink, and sexual services. These shared activities reconfigure instrumental relationships as friendships, bribes as gifts, and criminals as volunteers who help the police maintain social order. Women serve as entertainers, paid sex partners, status symbols, and sometimes co-conspirators. Osburg’s newly prosperous subjects are squeezed between the fear that rivals better connected than they are might take their property and the sense that the system they are part of is heading toward collapse. They feel trapped in a way of life that is exhausting and often boring, but the rest of society views them as models of success. Their behavior contributes to a widespread sense of moral decay in contemporary China.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

That turns out to be wrong. Schoenhals discovered piles of documents in flea markets and used bookshops that reveal an extensive citizen-agent apparatus at work in urban areas under the direction of the Ministry of Public Security. The agents were originally supposed to target enemy spies, saboteurs, and subversives but were soon turned against people with bad “class backgrounds,” citizens failing to show sufficient political enthusiasm, members of minority ethnic groups, and random targets unlucky enough to attract attention. The materials Schoenhals has collected focus chiefly on the bureaucratic processes of recruiting, training, and running agents. The impact of the surveillance on society remains to be studied. Schoenhals ends the story in 1967, when the system was disbanded during the factional struggles of the Cultural Revolution. But there is reason to believe that it has since been restored and expanded.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

He argues that Iran’s nuclear energy program is peaceful and that widely cited evidence of the Islamic Republic’s attempts to design nuclear weapons relies on fabrications concocted by Israel and the United States. He takes seriously the declarations of Iran’s supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, and of his predecessor, Ruhollah Khomeini, that nuclear weapons are un-Islamic and that Iran does not seek to develop them. To explain Iran’s record of deception relating to its nuclear program, Porter claims that U.S. efforts to prevent Iran from developing its civilian nuclear program have left Tehran with no choice but to work covertly and cover its tracks. He points to domestic political factors in Israel and the United States to explain why Tel Aviv and Washington would conspire in this alleged ruse to mislead the world about Iran’s intentions. The risk for Israel and the United States, of course, is that they might have to go to war to confront a threat that, Porter alleges, they know does not exist.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

11,The Struggle for Iraq’s Future,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2014-04-21/struggle-iraqs-future,The Struggle for Iraq’s Future,"Al-Ali, whose father was a former Iraqi diplomat who fled into exile, returned to Iraq as a legal adviser to the United Nations during the U.S. occupation. All his attempts to reform the post-Saddam state failed; this book is his lament. He inveighs against the returned Iraqi exiles who now wield power in Iraq, such as Prime Minister Nouri al-Malaki, criticizing them, along with Paul Bremer, who served as the head of the U.S.-led Coalition Provisional Authority in 2003–4, for needlessly leading Iraq into sectarianism and regionalism. Much of al-Ali’s analysis is useful but not original. Al-Ali is at his best on constitutional issues. He calls for a new Iraqi constitution that would provide for better civilian control of the military, more effective regulation of political parties, firmer anticorruption measures, reform of the oil and gas sector, and a clearer relationship between the central state and Iraq’s provinces. He predicts that the parliamentary elections of 2014 are unlikely to produce much change but hopes that Iraq might finally switch course after the provincial and parliamentary elections of 2017–18.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

He starts gently, rehearsing Sharon’s heroic military exploits as an architect of Israel’s victory over the Arabs in the Six-Day War in 1967 and as the savior of the flat-footed Israel Defense Forces in the Yom Kippur War of 1973. Landau proceeds, though, to skewer Sharon as a self-aggrandizing “King of Israel” who conflated the elevation of his own status with the defense of the nation. On two of the most controversial events in Sharon’s career -- his role in the massacre of Palestinian refugees at the hands of Lebanese Christian militias in the Sabra and Shatila camps in Beirut in 1982 and his provocative visit to Muslim holy sites in East Jerusalem in 2000, which helped trigger the second intifada -- Landau finds Sharon guilty of the charges leveled by his fiercest critics. But Landau believes that once Sharon became prime minister, in 2001, his statesman’s instincts took over, and a “monumental transformation” led Sharon, who had played a major role in establishing Israel’s settlements, to order the unilateral evacuation of settlers from Gaza.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

He argues that for the energized masses in villages and towns across the country, the common bond was not a rejection of socialism but a protest against the bureaucratic, oppressive, and inhumane way that it was pursued. By carefully sifting through a massive trove of ephemera produced by street protests and spontaneous civic mobilizations, he locates a common desire to create a new society of “humanness,” dedicated to nonviolence and democratic norms. He concludes his study by chronicling how those high hopes were fractured by more mundane conflicts over power and ceded ground to “radical, partisan” forces more preoccupied with the nationalist agendas that ultimately tore the country apart.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

After a decade of local efforts to deal with the immense damage done to those children, Nelson and his colleagues established the Bucharest Early Intervention Project in 2000. They are not social scientists but rather specialists in pediatrics, neuroscience, human development, and psychiatry, and their project was an elaborate 12-year randomized survey comparing the effects on young children of institutionalization to those of foster care. Their work confirmed many earlier studies that showed that institutionalization seriously impairs brain function and cognitive and motor development, but it also demonstrated that the timely transfer to proper foster care can materially reduce the damage done. For those interested in Romania or the region, the book offers an incisive and disturbing portrait of the benighted policies pursued in this area -- and not only by Romania. The book also contains an excellent discussion of the controversies surrounding the issue of international adoption in the Romanian context, which should also prompt thought among those focused on the parallel Russian case.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

Just out of the Royal Military College in Sandhurst, Churchill, 21 years old and already set on a political career, used his connections to get himself assigned to one of the British Empire’s many battle scenes, where he could collect medals and burnish his reputation. A year later, he succeeded, taking part in a three-week series of military forays against Afghan tribesmen in what is today Pakistan’s province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and nearly losing his life twice. Coughlin does a fine job of capturing the young Churchill’s qualities and flaws, his outlook on life, and his ostentatious candor about his aspirations. He also drives home just how much the British feared the encroachment into South Asia by the Russians, who the British believed were eager to poach the jewel of the British Empire. That fear motivated innumerable British military campaigns to shore up the border between Afghanistan and India during the second half of the nineteenth century. Coughlin’s portrait of the Pashtun warriors the British fought with dubious success and the parallels he draws with the United States and NATO’s struggle against their descendants are downright unnerving.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

Lee, the Confederate general. He was the son of a devout Christian minister, a graduate of Yale, and a Rhodes scholar. He was a favorite of William Donovan, the founding director of the wartime Office of Strategic Services (the forerunner of the CIA), in which Lee rose to high military rank. And from 1942 to 1945, he spied for the Soviet Union. His American spymaster betrayed him to the FBI in 1945. Although the director of the FBI, J. Edgar Hoover, became obsessed with snaring him, and despite Lee’s grilling before the House Un-American Activities Committee in 1948, Lee was never indicted on any charges and lived out the rest of his life as a successful, albeit anxiety-ridden, lawyer. Bradley has produced a truly superb example of this genre, especially because he exposes in riveting fashion how the Soviet spy network worked and how it flummoxed the FBI, which was very slow to catch on.

It is a fitting tribute to the care and balance that he and others of his generation bring to their work. Hardly any of the numerous published histories of the UN focus on the critical U.S.-Soviet interaction within the organization, and none of them exploits the recently opened Soviet archives as Gaiduk’s does. Gaiduk focuses on the formative first 20 years of the UN, the period during which high hopes for the organization dissolved into the pedestrian maneuvering of Cold War politics. The most striking thing that emerges from his account is the mechanical and small-bore approaches of both Moscow and Washington. His bottom-line conclusion is fairly predictable: the UN failed in its primary objective of sparing the world from the clash that became the Cold War, or at least easing the burden of the conflict, but many underestimate the UN’s role in mitigating the Cold War’s worst outcomes and in vastly expanding humanitarian aid and economic development.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

He begins with the famine of the early 1890s, which he sees as creating the pathway to the revolution in 1917, and then divides the century that followed into three generational phases. The first belongs to the “Old Bolsheviks,” the architects of Vladimir Lenin’s revolution, who were born in the 1870s and 1880s. The second phase began in the late 1920s, in the wake of Joseph Stalin’s collectivization program, and witnessed the monstrosity of industrialization through forced labor, the purges of the Great Terror, and the ravages of World War II. The third phase began with the Khrushchev era and ended with the collapse of the Soviet Union. The history of each phase comes in large quaffs that go down smoothly. Figes argues that for all the jarring changes, Soviet leaders, including the last, Mikhail Gorbachev, “all believed they were continuing the Revolution Lenin had begun.” It is a lucid and enlightening argument, although least compelling when Figes tries to find idealism even in the decaying entrails of the system during its final years. As he himself confesses, “what united [the third generation] was the preservation of the status quo.”Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

Emerging Entrepreneurs and Middle Classes,"Based on interviews with dozens of Cuban small-business proprietors and aided by a sophisticated reading of demographic data, Feinberg’s findings in this monograph discredit the tiresome narrative that there has been little real change in Cuba in recent years. Feinberg reports that “Cuba today is very much host to large and growing middle classes” thanks to new laws and regulations that encourage productive ownership and work not guided by the state. Further, he argues, this change portends a shift in the nature of Cuba’s development, because the new middle classes aspire to a more consumerist lifestyle. Enriched by useful case studies, the monograph concludes with thoughtful policy recommendations for the Cuban government that might facilitate the growth of the nonstate sector and enable Cuba to update its economy while experiencing a “soft landing,” instead of an economic shock. Feinberg also recommends that Washington end its pursuit of regime collapse, which serves to strengthen Cuban hard-liners, and instead pursue initiatives that would support independent entrepreneurs.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

This timely collection of academic studies explores the role of small businesses in achieving those objectives. Although it does not offer definitive answers, the volume questions some commonly held assumptions and draws distinctions among firms of various sizes and social origins. Not all pro-business public policies enhance social mobility, the editors reasonably argue. Many entrepreneurs arise from well-to-do families; indeed, in Latin America, a good predictor of an individual’s entrepreneurialism is whether his or her father was an entrepreneur. Hence, government policies that support upper-class entrepreneurialism risk consolidating existing social stratifications. The volume’s empirical studies of entrepreneurship in Argentina, Ecuador, and Mexico uncover many gems. For example, José Anchorena and Lucas Ronconi conclude that in Argentina, relatively well-paid public employment has “crowded out” entrepreneurship. A number of other contributors reflect on the business-democracy nexus and call for more business education but do not illuminate how it would directly cultivate responsible corporate citizenship and positive civic values.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

His gritty novels usually explore the moral compromises required to survive in his communist homeland. But in this ambitious, at times gripping work of historical fiction, Padura re-creates the 1940 assassination of Leon Trotsky in Mexico. The novelist draws a surprisingly sympathetic portrait of the outcast Bolshevik, hounded by Joseph Stalin. Padura’s Trotsky is arrogant and intransigent but also extraordinarily resilient and industrious in exile, self-critical and prescient, and emotionally devoted to his loving wife and children. In Padura’s version of this story, the macabre horrors of Stalinism, its reliance on fear and hatred, and its utter corruption of the utopian dream of socialism were embodied in the meticulous psychological conditioning of Ramón Mercader, the Spanish revolutionary selected by Stalin’s murderous machine to penetrate Trotsky’s fortified compound and drive an ice ax into the aging revolutionary’s brain. Padura laments the similar snuffing out of credulous dreams of Cuban revolutionaries but notes that the Soviet Union collapsed when the terror and lies began to subside. It is not clear whether the novelist foresees the same fate for Cuba.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

Yet one of the major developments of the last decade is that ordinary Europeans now pay more attention to what happens in Brussels and often respond negatively. This book traces the origins of that trend to a number of national referendums held in 2005 on a draft European constitution, most notably those held in France and the Netherlands. The constitution was the work of supranational officials in Brussels hoping to create a tighter union. The effort backfired when publics across the continent turned against the idea of an even more unified Europe. Still, Statham and Trenz contend that this shift has been less significant than it might appear. Their careful data analysis shows that political debates over Europe remain essentially national, with voters paying relatively little attention to foreign voices or issues. To be sure, debates about the euro are the exception; the single currency is the first pan-European issue of sustained interest to voters, mostly because it has created clear winners and losers.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

Most analyses of this question focus on issues of “high security” -- in particular, military intervention. Yet the comparative advantage the countries of the EU enjoy is civilian power. That is the subject of this pathbreaking volume, which analyzes topics such as trade, conflict resolution, climate change, development, energy, health, immigration, the Middle East, the UN Security Council, and the G-20. Although the book concludes with a familiar call for a more centralized EU foreign policy, its findings also offer some welcome correctives to the widespread view that the EU is an overly idealistic and ineffective organization. Although European institutions remain a complement, rather than a substitute, for national policymaking, the EU is becoming more effective over time. Moreover, EU decision-makers, far from being sentimentally attached to global multilateral institutions, successfully exploit bilateralism when it suits their own interests.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

Extreme right-wing parties are not alone in favoring policies that lead to discrimination against the nearly ten million Roma who live in Europe. These have included tolerating hate speech; running second-rate and segregated schools for Roma children; going easy on those who harass, assault, or murder Gypsies; and, most shocking, forcibly sterilizing Roma women. Even the Socialist president of France, François Hollande, has suggested that the free movement of people in the EU should not apply to Gypsies. Stewart and his contributors are anthropologists who favor integration and argue that the central problem is that European societies have “ethnicized” the Roma, making their ethnicity their primary identifying feature, thereby highlighting differences between them and others that otherwise might have remained invisible. Although this book is short on empirical social science or concrete policy analysis, it is a must-read for anyone interested in this critical issue of fairness and identity."

Bush administration and was at the center of some of the most bitter controversies of the “war on terror.” Now retired, he has written as close to a tell-all memoir as the CIA’s review board will permit. Rizzo’s book will not be the last word on the “enhanced interrogation techniques” that were employed by the CIA under controversial guidelines produced by lawyers in the Bush administration’s Justice Department. Few skeptics will be convinced by Rizzo’s argument, however detailed, that such notorious incidents as the destruction of videotapes depicting the waterboarding of detainees at CIA “black sites” were not part of a deliberate cover-up. Passions run strong on these subjects, and, as Rizzo candidly acknowledges, mistakes were made -- sometimes by him.

Marsden has the rare ability to describe complex controversies in clear and concise prose, and he explores the meaning of this change by returning to the almost forgotten work of U.S. public intellectuals of the late 1950s and early 1960s. Like dinosaurs unaware of the meteor speeding toward earth, the towering intellects and prestigious thinkers of that era thought and wrote with very little awareness of the impending change. Although Marsden feels no nostalgia for the flawed consensus of those days, he asks some probing questions about whether today’s public conversation is flexible enough to accommodate the increasing pluralism of American society and strong enough to support the values and common purpose that a democratic society requires.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

In this book, in between riffs on boomer absurdities, he gets serious. The result is something like a mash-up of Jerry Seinfeld and Francis Fukuyama. In O’Rourke’s view, the boomers, a frivolous group that can boast of few cultural or intellectual accomplishments, were the first post-historical generation. Born to parents who defeated fascism, contained communism, and laid the foundations for the greatest flowering of mass prosperity in world history, the boomers proceeded to dissipate their inherited social capital on the various self-indulgent fads and amusements that O’Rourke chronicles so well. Yet for all their wastrel ways, O’Rourke argues, the boomers are the future of humankind. Their form of consumer society will conquer the world, and the entire planet will fill up with self-indulgent narcissists. Friedrich Nietzsche would recognize O’Rourke’s portrait of the boomers: they are the first generation of Nietzsche’s “last men.”Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

He demonstrates how, until very recently, a common set of ideas about why and when the federal government should go into debt kept Washington’s fiscal house in order. It is a convincing analysis, although it is not always clear that the elements of the American “fiscal constitution” are quite as coherent or consistent as White depicts them to be. White argues for a set of reforms that he believes could win public support and restore the country’s tradition of financial prudence. He is no starry-eyed optimist and recognizes the serious political obstacles to his program. But he argues that because the reforms he supports aim to revitalize a fiscal tradition that has deep roots in American culture and history, the public can be brought around to support the sometimes painful choices they would require.

Sestanovich’s big idea is that since World War II, U.S. policy has oscillated between the poles of “maximalist” engagement, on the one hand, and retrenchment, on the other. Sestanovich refrains from demonizing either end of the spectrum. In his view, maximalists, such as U.S. Presidents Harry Truman, John F. Kennedy, and George W. Bush, were not simply hubristic overreachers, and presidents who tried to retrench, such as Dwight Eisenhower and Barack Obama, should not be seen as appeasers or defeatists. Any grand thesis that aims to cover so many cases will sometimes seem a little formulaic. But Sestanovich succeeds at making a strong case without pushing his argument further than the facts allow. This book will reward both the specialist and the novice; anyone interested in the past or the future of U.S. policy and power would benefit from its insights.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

This requires examining topics far removed from the drama and heroism of battle, including the complex interactions between weapon design and tactics and the constraints imposed by limited budgets. Epstein has done a remarkable job of mastering a range of highly technical issues connected to the development of torpedoes in the United Kingdom and the United States prior to World War I. As torpedoes improved, they affected the ability of warships to fire their big guns or to get close enough to shores to mount blockades. To adapt to the opportunities and complications posed by the new technology, militaries forged new relationships with the private sector, sharing the burden of development research and experimental trials. Epstein disarmingly admits that her subject matter does not make for the easiest read. Nonetheless, her book will set the standard for further research on the military-industrial complex.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."
33,American Arsenal: A Century of Waging War,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2014-04-21/american-arsenal-century-waging-war,American Arsenal: A Century of Waging War,"Coffey, a historian of science, traces the origins of some of the most important weapons of the past century, profiling the scientists responsible for their development and the interactions between those scientists and the military officials and politicians who decided whether and how the weapons should be used. Coffey’s examples are all from U.S. military history, and they are all high-profile cases: chemical weapons (including napalm), long-range bombers and missiles, nuclear weapons, and drones. Less flashy but just as important arms, such as tanks and antitank weapons, fighter aircraft, submarines, and torpedoes, are absent. Coffey writes well, but he tells familiar stories, with the exception of his interesting account of the U.S. contribution to the development of chemical weapons. And although some of the characters in his book, such as the scientist James Conant and the air force general Curtis LeMay, make regular appearances, they do not quite hold the narrative together, and no strong themes emerge, other than a general emphasis on the importance of personalities and institutions, as well as strategy and science, in shaping the American arsenal.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

Psychology is also a critical part of caring for veterans coping with disabilities or posttraumatic stress disorder, and psychology’s insights might help reduce the alarming rates of suicide among Americans who have fought in Afghanistan and Iraq. But Matthews warns against assuming that all combat is psychologically damaging. And he forcefully argues that the U.S. armed forces must continue to move away from being predominantly white, male, and homophobic. He also notes that the U.S. military has benefited from a greater appreciation of the cultures in which it operates and from teaching its officers how to lead in complex settings. He concludes with some thoughts about how psychology might promote peace and on the ethical issues raised by providing psychological support to armed forces when they are doing bad or foolish things: he warns, for example, that psychologists should have nothing to do with torture. Although the book is somewhat U.S.-centric, Matthews’ style is engaging and draws extensively on his own experiences.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

The man Roosevelt inherited as army chief of staff was a military celebrity, a war hero with a political agenda, an expansive ego, and a shaky grasp of the proper conduct of civil-military relations. A less confident president might have sought to keep MacArthur at arm’s length, but Roosevelt saw how he might tame MacArthur and use him for his own purposes, such as providing a degree of political cover with Republicans as he cut the army’s budget. It was during World War II that Roosevelt took his greatest gamble on MacArthur, putting him in charge of the U.S. offensive against Japan. In this absorbing and vivid account, Perry argues that the bet paid off. Without ever denying MacArthur’s flaws and mistakes, Perry revives the general’s reputation by carefully and positively appraising his role in some of the war’s key moments. Just as Roosevelt knew how to manage his most egotistical subordinates, so MacArthur, as Perry shows, relied on the quality of his combat commanders and his own ability to get the best out of them."
36,Can War Be Eliminated?,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2014-04-21/can-war-be-eliminated,Can War Be Eliminated?,"Coker does not leave readers guessing about his answer to the title’s question. He sees war not as a vicious, dysfunctional throwback to more primitive, pre-rational times but as an essential feature of human societies. War is ingrained; peace, on the other hand, is an idea that has to be embraced by all if it is to take root. On this matter, Coker has little faith in progress. War has served an evolutionary purpose and continues to evolve itself, in response to cultural shifts and new developments in technology. Digitization and robotics provide new means of fighting and reshape the meaning of war, including devaluing the notions of sacrifice and heroism. This is a short, stimulating book, packed with ideas and quotes from a remarkably disparate range of sources. Not all of Coker’s provocative statements withstand critical scrutiny, but this is a book that will challenge readers who are skeptical of its premise. If those who believe in the possibility of ending war want to persuade others, Coker concludes, “they will have to come up with better arguments.”"
37,The Son Also Rises: Surnames and the History of Social Mobility,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2014-04-20/son-also-rises-surnames-and-history-social-mobility,The Son Also Rises: Surnames and the History of Social Mobility,"This intriguing book measures social mobility in a novel way, by tracing unusual surnames over several generations in nine different countries, focusing on intergenerational changes in education, wealth, and social status as indicated by occupation. Two surprising generalizations emerge. The first is that social mobility is much lower than is usually supposed, even in the United States. The second is that social mobility does not differ greatly from country to country or over long periods of time, even in China, despite its radical communist revolution, or in Sweden and the United Kingdom, which since 1945 have deliberately promoted the goal of better mobility. (Notably, India, with its history of caste stratification, does show lower mobility than other countries.) Clark concludes that family talent, whether genetic or environmental in origin, persists over generations and reverts to the mean of the surrounding population very slowly. One implication he notes is that public measures to increase mobility are likely to be less effective and durable than policymakers assume. Another is that redistributive taxation is likely to have a less deleterious effect on an economy than many claim.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly."

But as economists have long demonstrated, foreign trade enhances economic well-being. Foreign trade negotiations, an aspect of foreign policy as well as economic policy, have become enormously complicated, and the resulting agreements, extremely complex. These two books help readers navigate these complexities and some recent changes in the field. Krist, a former U.S. trade negotiator, provides a useful primer on current world trade rules, structures, and negotiations, from an American perspective. Michalopoulos, a former World Bank official, describes trade policies and practices in developing countries and those countries’ growing role in managing, staffing, and shaping the World Trade Organization and trade negotiations. This represents a significant change from pre-1980 arrangements, which were largely dominated by North Americans and Europeans. Both books offer constructive suggestions for reviving the moribund Doha Round of trade talks and for otherwise fostering more trade liberalization."

For a variety of reasons, some reflecting the growing importance of television and digital sources of information and the resulting financial decline of newspapers, investigations of businesses and financial markets receded sharply over the past decade; in Starkman’s terms, “accountability journalism” gave way to “access journalism.” The result was much more coverage of current earnings and successful or colorful business personalities, rather than analysis of the underlying sources of those earnings or the impressive compensation those personalities earned. The book adds most financial journalists and their bosses to the list of people culpable for the financial crisis of 2008; better investigative journalism would have exposed more of the misleading sales pitches, outright fraud, and systemic corruption in the U.S. mortgage market, perhaps even in time to sharply diminish the severity of the crisis."
40,Fueling Up: The Economic Implications of America’s Oil and Gas Boom,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2014-04-21/fueling-economic-implications-americas-oil-and-gas-boom,Fueling Up: The Economic Implications of America’s Oil and Gas Boom,"Reversing decades of declines in U.S. production of gas and oil, the discovery of how to extract shale gas and so-called tight oil has raised U.S. output by more than 25 percent since 2007, resulting in claims of a renaissance in American manufacturing and creating the prospect of “energy independence” within two decades. Some of the hype has relied on exaggeration; Houser and Mohan, in contrast, provide a sober, largely quantitative assessment of this startling development. Their plausible best guesses suggest the new production will add 0.2 percentage points a year to growth in U.S. GDP until 2020, a small but significant stimulus, and will raise the level of potential U.S. GDP by 1.4 percent for several decades after that. The environment will also benefit, insofar as gas will increasingly substitute for coal in power generation. The new production will also boost U.S. trade in a number of ways. All in all, this is a positive development for the United States, made possible by several government-assisted innovations in gas and oil extraction and the dogged persistence of a few U.S. firms."
41,Sovereignty and the Responsibility to Protect: A New History,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/sovereignty-and-responsibility-protect-new-history,Sovereignty and the Responsibility to Protect: A New History,"The principle of a “responsibility to protect” civilians from genocide and other crimes against humanity was first endorsed by the UN in 2005 and was used to authorize NATO’s intervention in Libya in 2011. The concept is widely seen as a radical break with older Westphalian norms of sovereignty. But Glanville shows that the idea that sovereign states should enjoy the absolute right of autonomous self-government and nonintervention was not present at the creation of the Westphalian system, in the seventeenth century. He chronicles how, as absolutist rule gave way to liberal democracy and the nation-state spread to regions outside the West, profound shifts took place in the concept of sovereignty; only in the twentieth century did the idea of unconditional rights to self-government and nonintervention solidify, mostly owing to the efforts of non-European peoples who had suffered at the hands of Western colonialism. Ironically, those efforts were a backlash against the irresponsible ways in which European states had long used and abused the loopholes in their own doctrines of sovereignty to justify exploitative interventions. That history ought to weigh on the minds of today’s powerful states whenever they consider how to act on ideas of responsible sovereignty."
42,Global Interdependence: The World After 1945,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2014-04-21/global-interdependence-world-after-1945,Global Interdependence: The World After 1945,"Most world histories of the post-1945 era place the Cold War and the rise of American power at the center of the story. In this impressive new work, Iriye and his collaborators focus on the deeper trends that have unsettled and reshaped the contemporary world system. In sweeping narratives, the contributors highlight the profound ways in which transnational forces -- trade, investment, immigration, communication, and so on -- have linked disparate political spaces and transformed human consciousness. Of course, globalization existed before 1945, beginning to take hold as early as the 1870s. But Iriye observes that prior to the contemporary period, globalization was driven by Western powers, pushed forward by colonizers, capitalists, self-appointed civilizers, and great-power rivalry. In more recent times, Iriye sees the process as driven more by non-Western peoples seeking to make their own history, which has in turn lent contemporary world politics a sense of international community and a common human destiny. Nationalism, protectionism, xenophobia, and great-power rivalry have not completely disappeared, of course. But in Iriye’s inspiring historical vision, transnationalism has helped usher in a more stable and peaceful world."
43,Global Governance at Risk,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/global-governance-risk,Global Governance at Risk,"In Held and Roger’s view, the world faces a growing “governance gap”: as globalization creates new types of economic, environmental, and security problems that can be solved only through collective international efforts, states remain stubbornly reluctant to cooperate. Held and Roger worry that the concept and practice of global governance are on the brink of collapse. They do not themselves quite predict a systemic collapse of global institutions, but they do see a future of increasing dysfunction and crisis, and the other contributors to this volume provide plenty of fodder for that view. Benjamin Cohen depicts an international monetary and financial system that has become less regulated, less transparent, and less predictable, thus increasing the odds of a systemic crisis. Robert Wade highlights the difficulty of integrating emerging economies into global governance institutions, arguing that Western states have resisted efforts to share authority. But the book lacks a clear picture of the coalitions and constituencies that might rise up in the midst of a future crisis to build a new generation of multilateral rules and institutions."
44,Maxwell’s Demon and the Golden Apple,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2014-04-21/maxwells-demon-and-golden-apple,Maxwell’s Demon and the Golden Apple,"This is the most original and thought-provoking forecast of the future of world politics to be published in recent years. Schweller sees the global system breaking down, moving from an American-led era of order to chaotic disorder. Borrowing from the field of thermodynamics, Schweller foresees a sort of global entropy, in which the diffusion of power slowly reduces the amount of energy in the international system. In the absence of a preponderant power, global politics will become a decentralized and disorganized affair in which there are no leaders, no followers, and no states capable of generating cooperation. This is not a pleasant future to contemplate: atomized, unpredictable, ungovernable. A proliferating array of groups and individuals will pursue their own narrow interests and visions, but no one will have the power to foster collective action or look out for the common good. One hopes that Schweller is wrong, and that a decentralized, networked world will be capable of tackling global problems and that shared governance will replace or supplement hegemonic leadership."

He rejects the idea that the ongoing global economic transition is the result of U.S. decline or failure; rather, it is a story of non-Western countries getting their economic acts together, aided in no small part by Washington’s leadership in maintaining an open and multilateral system. The book offers a steady stream of statistics to show how the West will in fact be richer in a world where the developing countries thrive. Kenny worries about the environmental implications of a world in which billions more people approach Western standards of living, but he has faith that free markets, education, and innovation will offset those costs. His convincing conclusion argues that Western countries should take steps now to lock in global rules and institutions that will protect their interests and values in a future in which they will be less powerful. The main flaw with Kenny’s optimistic vision is that it does not adequately address the age-old dilemmas of security competition and geopolitical struggle."

This reformulation of U.S. priorities has emerged during a period of much-needed strategic reassessment, after more than a decade of intense engagement with South Asia and the Middle East. It is premised on the idea that the history of the twenty-first century will be written largely in the Asia-Pacific, a region that welcomes U.S. leadership and rewards U.S. engagement with a positive return on political, economic, and military investments."
47,The Truth About Castro,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/cuba/2014-04-21/truth-about-castro,The Truth About Castro,"In his review of Nick Caistor’s book Fidel Castro (September/October 2013), Richard Feinberg writes that “it is surely too soon to issue a definitive verdict on the reign of Fidel Castro.” But it is certainly not too soon, if one considers the evidence. Today, Cuba produces virtually nothing at all. It floats dead in the tropical waters. After being supported for years by the Soviets, the country’s economy now relies on Venezuelan aid and, bizarrely, international tourism."
48,Fixing the Pentagon,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2014-04-21/fixing-pentagon,Fixing the Pentagon,"Just about every year, it seems, Foreign Affairs publishes at least one essay by a current or former senior leader of the U.S. Department of Defense with a narrative that goes something like this: “The Pentagon was a broken, inflexible bureaucracy when I came into office. There was a problem with [insert specific problem here]. I created/encouraged/supported a nifty solution, and it worked great. If only the solution stays/had stayed in place after I leave/left, the Pentagon would work once again.”"

But foreign enterprises account for only ten percent of Poland’s work force, and Orenstein does not discuss the country’s large domestic economy. Poland’s bureaucratic repression of domestic businesses keeps wages down and makes it difficult for innovative and high-tech companies to develop. This dynamic has led to high unemployment, low wages, and the lowest labor participation rate in Europe. Small enterprises make up a smaller proportion of Poland’s economy than they do in the EU as a whole."

The most important part of the story today is not the maneuvering of Russian President Vladimir Putin vis-à-vis Muslim clerics but rather the rising tensions between the country’s two largest religious communities."
53,Washington's Weak-State Agenda,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2014-04-17/washingtons-weak-state-agenda,Washington’s Weak-State Agenda,"In his essay “The Rise and Fall of the Failed-State Paradigm” (January/February 2014), Michael Mazarr heralds the end of “the recent era of interventionist U.S. state building,” which he argues lasted from the mid-1990s to around 2010. Washington’s “obsession with weak states,” he writes, “was always more of a mania than a sound strategic doctrine.” But as budget austerity and public opinion shake policymakers loose from this dangerous distraction, he predicts, the United States will finally be able to focus on “grand strategic initiatives” and “transformative diplomacy.” Much of Mazarr’s argument rings true. Mazarr is right that the threats incubated by weak or failing states have turned out to be less urgent for U.S. national security than many observers feared, that the ambiguous definition of failing states has made it difficult to take meaningful action, and that policymakers have found it hard to blend the political and technocratic dimensions of state-building endeavors. Other parts of his narrative, however, rest on shakier ground."

55,Capital Punishment,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/review-essay/capital-punishment,Capital Punishment,"Every now and then, the field of economics produces an important book; this is one of them. Thomas Piketty’s tome will put capitalist wealth back at the center of public debate, resurrect interest in the subject of wealth distribution, and revolutionize how people view the history of income inequality. On top of that, although the book’s prose (translated from the original French) might not qualify as scintillating, any educated person will be able to understand it—which sets the book apart from the vast majority of works by high-level economic theorists."

This potential upending of the region’s territorial order has come to be known as “the end of Sykes-Picot,” a reference to the secret 1916 Anglo-French agreement to divide up the Middle Eastern provinces of the Ottoman Empire into British and French zones of control. Because the European treaties that created new Arab states in the aftermath of World War I upheld the outlines of that agreement, Sykes-Picot became the convenient shorthand for the map that colonial powers imposed on the region, one that has remained essentially constant to the present day."

Americans suddenly learned that in recent years, the NSA had been acquiring the phone and Internet communications of hundreds of thousands of U.S. citizens, as well as collecting massive volumes of bulk telephone records known as “metadata” -- phone numbers and the time and length of calls. Along with the rest of the world, Americans found out that the NSA had broken common forms of online encryption, tapped the phones of various foreign heads of state, and monitored global communications far more aggressively than was previously understood."
58,Show Them the Money,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/show-them-money,Show Them the Money,"Every year, wealthy countries spend billions of dollars to help the world’s poor, paying for cows, goats, seeds, beans, textbooks, business training, microloans, and much more. Such aid is designed to give poor people things they can’t afford or the tools and skills to earn more. Much of this aid undoubtedly works. But even when assistance programs accomplish things, they often do so in a tremendously expensive and inefficient way. Part of this is due to overhead, but overhead costs get far more attention than they deserve. More worrisome is the actual price of procuring and giving away goats, textbooks, sacks of beans, and the like."
59,Near Eastern Promises,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/east-asia/2014-04-17/near-eastern-promises,Near Eastern Promises,"Contrary to popular myths and conspiracy theories about Washington’s desire to control the Middle East, for the past six decades, U.S. policymakers have usually sought to minimize the United States’ involvement there. But the high-stakes nature of American interests in the region -- particularly oil -- and the complexity of the Middle East’s problems always seem to draw the United States back in. In spite of himself, U.S. President Dwight Eisenhower was sucked into the Suez crisis in 1956 and the pan-Arabist revolts of the late 1950s. Lyndon Johnson barely lifted a finger to prevent the Six-Day War in 1967. Richard Nixon found himself grudgingly drawn into the region by the 1973 Arab-Israeli war and the superpower nuclear crisis it caused. Despite his aggressive image, Ronald Reagan did little in response to repeated attacks in Lebanon and the Persian Gulf by Iran and its proxies. George H. W. Bush came to office hoping to ignore Saddam Hussein, not to go to war with him. And although it is rarely remembered today, George W. Bush was not particularly interested in the Middle East and paid little attention to the region prior to the 9/11 attacks."

As he sees it, an increasingly formidable coalition of illiberal powers -- China, Iran, and Russia -- is determined to undo the post–Cold War settlement and the U.S.-led global order that stands behind it. Across Eurasia, he argues, these aggrieved states are bent on building spheres of influence to threaten the foundations of U.S. leadership and the global order. So the United States must rethink its optimism, including its post–Cold War belief that rising non-Western states can be persuaded to join the West and play by its rules. For Mead, the time has come to confront the threats from these increasingly dangerous geopolitical foes."
61,The Return of Geopolitics,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2014-04-17/return-geopolitics,The Return of Geopolitics,"So far, the year 2014 has been a tumultuous one, as geopolitical rivalries have stormed back to center stage. Whether it is Russian forces seizing Crimea, China making aggressive claims in its coastal waters, Japan responding with an increasingly assertive strategy of its own, or Iran trying to use its alliances with Syria and Hezbollah to dominate the Middle East, old-fashioned power plays are back in international relations."
62,Russia’s Latest Land Grab,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/ukraine/2014-04-17/russias-latest-land-grab,Russia’s Latest Land Grab,"Russia’s occupation and annexation of the Crimean Peninsula in February and March have plunged Europe into one of its gravest crises since the end of the Cold War. Despite analogies to Munich in 1938, however, Russia’s invasion of this Ukrainian region is at once a replay and an escalation of tactics that the Kremlin has used for the past two decades to maintain its influence across the domains of the former Soviet Union. Since the early 1990s, Russia has either directly supported or contributed to the emergence of four breakaway ethnic regions in Eurasia: Transnistria, a self-declared state in Moldova on a strip of land between the Dniester River and Ukraine; Abkhazia, on Georgia’s Black Sea coast; South Ossetia, in northern Georgia; and, to a lesser degree, Nagorno-Karabakh, a landlocked mountainous region in southwestern Azerbaijan that declared its independence under Armenian protection following a brutal civil war. Moscow’s meddling has created so-called frozen conflicts in these states, in which the splinter territories remain beyond the control of the central governments and the local de facto authorities enjoy Russian protection and influence."
63,What Iran Really Wants,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/iran/2014-04-17/what-iran-really-wants,What Iran Really Wants,"Foreign policy is a critical component in the lives, conduct, and governance of all nation-states. But it has become even more significant in recent years as interstate relations have grown ever more complex. The inexorable rise in the number of international players—including multilateral organizations, nonstate actors, and even individuals—has further complicated policymaking. Meanwhile, the ongoing process of globalization—however conceived and defined, whether lauded or despised—has brought its inescapable weight to bear on the foreign policies of all states, whether large or small, developed or developing."
64,Powering the Pentagon,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2014-04-17/powering-pentagon,Powering the Pentagon,"In the immediate aftermath of World War II, the U.S. naval aviator Thomas Moorer questioned Takeo Kurita, a former vice admiral of the Imperial Japanese Navy, as part of the U.S. military’s postwar interrogation of Japanese commanders. Kurita told Moorer that one of the most significant reversals of fortune Japan had suffered during the war was the loss of fuel supplies. “We ran out of oil,” Kurita said, and by the end of the war, the Japanese military had grown so desperate, it was operating its equipment on fuel distilled from old tires, rice, and even pine needles. “What I learned then,” Moorer would note years later, “was never lose a war, and the way to lose a war is to run out of oil.”"
65,Nuclear Freeze,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/world/2014-04-17/nuclear-freeze,Nuclear Freeze,"These days, the long-term role that nuclear power will play in the global energy market remains uncertain. That would have come as a surprise to the scientists and engineers who, during the 1950s and 1960s, pioneered the study of nuclear fission, built test reactors, and designed nuclear-powered airplanes and rockets. They would also have been surprised, and likely dismayed, that the light-water reactor -- the technology that powered the first nuclear submarine, in 1954 -- remains the dominant commercial technology for producing fission energy. The glacial rate of change in nuclear technology over the last 60 or so years is why many energy analysts characterize current nuclear reactor technologies as “mature.”"
66,Electric Avenue,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/world/electric-avenue,Electric Avenue,"In 1896, a 33-year-old engineer working for the Detroit branch of Thomas Edison’s Edison Illuminating Company traveled to New York for the firm’s annual convention. The automobile was the obvious technology of the future by then, but it wasn’t yet clear what would propel it: steam, electricity, or gasoline. Edison had been tinkering with batteries that could power a car, so he was interested to hear that the engineer from Detroit had invented a two-cylinder gasoline vehicle. After hearing a description of the car, Edison immediately recognized its superiority."
67,"Don't Just Drill, Baby -- Drill Carefully",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2014-04-17/dont-just-drill-baby-drill-carefully,"Don’t Just Drill, Baby -- Drill Carefully","The energy business has a way of making smart people look dumb. Experts were blindsided by the shale revolution in the United States. For most of the last few decades, they had assumed that U.S. domestic energy supplies were dwindling. Then, advances in horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing, or “fracking” -- the injection of high-pressure streams of sand, water, and chemicals into underground shale and other rock to unlock oil and natural gas trapped there -- significantly boosted total U.S. natural gas production, by as much as 25 percent in recent years, forcing many experts to change their tune. Horizontal drilling and fracking are now having an even bigger impact on domestic oil production: five years ago, most new onshore rigs were drilling for shale gas, but today, most are drilling for oil in shale and so-called tight rock formations. Experts are confidently pointing to the benefits of abundant supplies of this unconventional oil and gas for the U.S. economy: lower energy costs, new jobs, and even a revival in some parts of the manufacturing sector. Politicians from both parties, meanwhile, are vying to be the most enthusiastic boosters of domestic natural gas."
68,The United States of Gas,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/united-states/united-states-gas,The United States of Gas,"Less than a decade ago, the future of American energy looked bleak. Domestic production of both oil and gas was dwindling, and big U.S. energy companies, believing their fortunes lay offshore, had long since turned away from the mainland. But then something remarkable occurred: a surge of innovation allowed companies to extract vast quantities of natural gas trapped in once-inaccessible deposits of shale. The resulting abundance drove down U.S. gas prices to about one-third of the global average."
69,Welcome to the Revolution,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2014-04-17/welcome-revolution,Welcome to the Revolution,"Despite its doubters and haters, the shale revolution in oil and gas production is here to stay. In the second half of this decade, moreover, it is likely to spread globally more quickly than most think. And all of that is, on balance, a good thing for the world."
70,Rebooting Rwanda,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/interviews/2014-04-01/paul-kagame-rebooting-rwanda,Rebooting Rwanda,"On April 6, 1994, a plane carrying Rwandan President Juvénal Habyarimana was shot down by unidentified assailants. The next day, the killings began. Over the next three months, as the international community stood by, an estimated one million Rwandans—Tutsis and moderate Hutus—were systematically slaughtered by Hutu extremists, mostly using clubs and machetes. The genocide, one of history’s worst and certainly its quickest, finally ended in July, when the Rwandan Patriotic Front seized control of the country. The rebel army was led by a 36-year-old Tutsi former refugee named Paul Kagame, who promptly took political control: serving first as the de facto leader of the country while defense minister and vice president and then, in 2000, assuming the presidency. During Kagame’s two-decade rule, Rwanda has made spectacular progress. A country famously deemed “nonviable” in the mid-1990s has become one of Africa’s best-run, most orderly, least corrupt, and safest states, with a booming economy (Rwanda’s GDP has grown by an average of eight percent in recent years). But Rwanda’s success has come with a darker side: opposition politicians have been jailed or killed under mysterious circumstances, journalists complain of harassment, and Kigali has been regularly criticized for meddling in neighboring Congo’s long-running civil war. In late February, Kagame met with Foreign Affairs managing editor Jonathan Tepperman in Kigali to discuss these controversies, his tenure, Rwanda today, and the legacy of the mass killings two decades ago."
71,The Rise of Rwanda’s Women,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/rwanda/2014-03-30/rise-rwandas-women,The Rise of Rwanda’s Women,"Twenty years ago, in 100 days of slaughter between April and July 1994, an estimated one million Rwandan men, women, and children were killed by their fellow citizens. It was one of the worst genocides in history, and its effects still ripple through Rwanda, central and eastern Africa, and the world at large."

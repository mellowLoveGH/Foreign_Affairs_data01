0,ISIS: The State of Terror,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2015-12-14/isis-state-terror,ISIS: The State of Terror,"Despite the similarities between ISIS and previous theocratic revolutionaries, from the Abbasids to the Wahhabis, the rise of the Islamic State represents something new and modern. The technologies of globalization offer contemporary radical extremists opportunities to reach mass audiences their predecessors could never have imagined, and ISIS has exploited these technologies more successfully than any of its contemporaries in the Islamist world. Stern and Berger’s book provides the most compelling analysis yet of the group’s creative and sophisticated propaganda efforts and its unprecedented use of social media. ISIS has several thousand active online supporters who operate in disciplined regiments. After the group posts something to the Internet—say, a beheading video—and it is authenticated, a second-tier regiment takes to Twitter to “retweet the link with a hashtag, then retweet each other’s tweets and write new tweets.” At coordinated times, online hashtag campaigns generate hundreds of similar tweets to create a “Twitter storm.” Other members upload the material to multiple platforms so that it remains available even if Internet providers pull the content down. If  “al Qaeda was publicity-shy,” write Stern and Berger, “ISIS, in contrast, is a publicity whore.”"
1,Robotics and World Poverty,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/world/robotics-and-world-poverty,Robotics and World Poverty,"Your otherwise balanced package on the potential impact of automation (“Hi, Robot,” July/August 2015) was lacking in one crucial respect: it failed to assess the effect robots might have on the 80 percent of the world’s population who don’t live in rich, developed nations."
2,Smiling Buddha,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/india/smiling-buddha,Smiling Buddha,"In “An Unworthy Ally” (September/ October 2015), C. Christine Fair and Sumit Ganguly argue that the United States should cut off military aid to Pakistan. That is a sensible recommendation, but the authors’ discussion of Pakistan’s acquisition of nuclear weapons is misleading. Fair and Ganguly give the impression that Pakistan, a defeated and partitioned nation after its 1971 war with India, unilaterally decided to develop nuclear weapons with diplomatic cover from the United States. In fact, it was India’s nuclear bomb test, in May 1974, that precipitated the arms race on the Indian subcontinent."
3,Two-State Progress,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/israel/2015-10-19/two-state-progress,Two-State Progress,"Grant Rumley and Amir Tibon (“The Death and Life of the Two-State Solution,” July/August 2015) focus on how to move Israel toward supporting a two-state accord. But there is another side to the discussion: how to move Palestinian leaders toward supporting such an agreement."
4,An Intelligence Downgrade,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2015-10-19/intelligence-downgrade,An Intelligence Downgrade,"Jane Harman (“Disrupting the Intelligence Community,” March/April 2015) argues that the U.S. intelligence agencies should focus on their respective strengths: covert paramilitary action for the CIA and cryptography and cyberwarfare for the National Security Agency (NSA). Harman’s remarks on the importance of open-source and social media intelligence are valid, and she rightly argues that covert CIA drone strikes have effectively disrupted terrorists groups in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Yemen. But this is where the soundness of her assessment ends."
5,Committee Confusion,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/united-states/committee-confusion,Committee Confusion,"In his review of several documents on the U.S. Senate’s report on the CIA's torture of detainees, Robert Jervis (“The Torture Blame Game,” May/June 2015) mistakenly states that the chairs and vice chairs of the House and Senate Intelligence Committees were briefed about the CIA’s interrogation programs beginning in September 2002. As the vice chair of the House Intelligence Committee at that time, I want to make it clear that it was the chair and the ranking minority member of the committee, not the vice chair, who were briefed on that program and on other matters concealed from the full membership of the House and Senate Intelligence Committees after 9/11."
6,Inequality and the Safety Net,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/inequality-and-safety-net,Inequality and the Safety Net,"In “The Next Safety Net” (July/ August 2015), Nicolas Colin and Bruno Palier correctly identify the increasing incompatibility between twentieth-century social welfare systems and twenty-first-century employment patterns. They predict a future in which the majority of workers will have precarious, short-term, low-paying jobs and in which social benefits tied to an outdated occupational model will fail to meet their needs."
7,Climate Change and European Security,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2015-10-19/climate-change-and-european-security,Climate Change and European Security,"Youngs makes the case for more decisive European action on climate change by linking environmental risks to emerging security threats. He argues that ecological stress and disasters will trigger violent conflict, border tensions, resource scarcity, economic disputes, democratic instability, increased migration, and global power shifts. Curiously, however, this book does as much to undermine its case as to make it. It demonstrates that EU officials and politicians talk a great deal about the relationship between the environment and security but have done little to address it, in large part because the link remains abstract and the concrete policy solutions unclear. Youngs’ theoretical arguments for a coordinated Brussels-based approach rest on a simplistic and misapplied dichotomy whereby “realists” predict rivalry and independent pursuit of material interest and “liberals” foresee multilateral cooperation and environmental priorities. His practical proposals for fighting climate change are logistically and politically daunting, requiring heavy lifting by national militaries, UN agencies, crisis-prevention groups, development institutions, and a wide range of interest groups. It’s worth wondering whether the attention paid to this trendy issue might be better applied elsewhere."
8,Europe's Path to Crisis: Disintegration via Monetary Union,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2015-10-19/europes-path-crisis-disintegration-monetary-union,Europe’s Path to Crisis: Disintegration via Monetary Union,"Nearly everyone now agrees that the euro is dysfunctional, at least in its current form. Among the currency’s greatest liabilities is that it fuels blanket criticism of all other EU policies, most of which have actually been politically and economically successful. So in the years to come, Europe watchers should expect more books like this one, in which Gallagher tosses the baby out with the bath water. He recycles a litany of British Euroskeptical criticisms of the EU: it is, in his view, an undemocratic, left-wing superstate foisted on unsuspecting European peoples by an alliance of government bureaucrats and ideologically driven politicians. Such claims have been convincingly refuted many times, and this book provides almost no original evidence for them—even Gallagher’s potted history of how the monetary union came about is unsupported by the current historiography. Still, his description of how the monetary union is failing today is more telling, and the chapters that focus on this issue should be taken seriously."
9,Single Markets: Economic Integration in Europe and the United States,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2015-10-19/single-markets-economic-integration-europe-and-united-states,Single Markets: Economic Integration in Europe and the United States,"This sophisticated book compares the most ambitious and successful single market created in the late nineteenth century, the United States, with its late-twentieth-century counterpart, the EU. The comparison is instructive because, whatever economists may counsel, societies do not simply make choices to maximize economic welfare as a matter of course. Instead, they respond to complex pressures from business interests and legal advocates. Egan maintains that such pressures have ultimately led to similar outcomes on both sides of the Atlantic, generating rules to protect the free movement of goods and, eventually, a single currency, while maintaining local restrictions on service provision and the practice of professions. What differences remain reflect inherited institutional residue. Egan makes a good case, yet substantial differences between the EU and the United States suggest that the underlying commitments to social, political, and ideological integration remain very different in the two regions: one cannot help wondering if Europeans just don’t want a United States of Europe. This is nonetheless an insightful work, particularly for those who follow transatlantic regulatory matters."
10,The Trouble with Empire: Challenges to Modern British Imperialism,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2015-10-19/trouble-empire-challenges-modern-british-imperialism,The Trouble with Empire: Challenges to Modern British Imperialism,"This book begins with an overenthusiastic and unconvincing effort to distinguish itself from previous works of imperial history. Yet readers should persevere, because Burton’s basic interpretation of imperial rule is provocative and relevant. She maintains that the British Empire was never as solidly grounded as many believe: in many respects, it did not work very well, even at its height. From the American Revolution, through the Opium Wars, the Anglo-Afghan Wars, and the Anglo-Zulu War, to nationalist uprisings on the Indian subcontinent, imperial rule faced constant armed opposition. Informal labor and marketplace rebellions were commonplace. Imperial authorities often responded with cultural incomprehension and military incompetence. To be sure, this interpretation requires a rather one-sided focus on British failures, yet it does make a plausible case that even at its apex, “the empire on which the sun never set” contained the seeds of its own destruction."
11,Germany: Memories of a Nation,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2015-10-19/germany-memories-nation,Germany: Memories of a Nation,"The history of Germany has been told many times, often most memorably by sophisticated, engaging Brits. MacGregor’s new book, a companion to a BBC series and a London exhibition, is no exception to that tradition. Its basic theme, namely, that the German past is uniquely complex, fragmented, and self-critical, is hardly new. Yet MacGregor’s presentation differs from others because it adorns each section of the book with photos and descriptions of physical objects—a technique taken from his recent bestseller, A History of the World in 100 Objects. These items range from the obvious, such as Martin Luther’s Bible, to the obscure, such as a crude handcart that refugees used to flee East Prussia during World War II. In each case, they help lend visceral texture and immediacy to the evolution of the German spirit. To be sure, this approach has its flaws: politicians remain distant, thinkers and poets are shortchanged, and composers are almost absent. But the book makes for a satisfying read nonetheless."
12,How the French Think: An Affectionate Portrait of an Intellectual People,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2015-10-19/how-french-think-affectionate-portrait-intellectual-people,How the French Think: An Affectionate Portrait of an Intellectual People,"Hazareesingh explains French intellectual life more clearly than his subjects themselves possibly could, caught up as they are in the discourses, habits of mind, and pathologies he describes. The book begins with a set of familiar stereotypes and bons mots about French thinkers: their tendency to privilege deduction over empiricism, abstraction over concreteness, and style over substance. Yet it soon delves deeper, focusing with great intelligence and subtlety on distinctively French conceptions of history, nationhood, democratic participation, existentialism, and the creative tension between order and imagination. Hazareesingh closes by discussing how a current French crisis of doubt has diluted what was once a confident intellectual universalism. He sometimes falters when linking ideas to political trends and at times fails to distinguish clearly what is essentially French and what is only coincidentally so. Yet anyone who loves, loathes, or is just perplexed by self-styled French intellectuals—that is, most educated French people—should read this book."
13,Reinhold Niebuhr: Major Works on Religion and Politics,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2015-10-19/reinhold-niebuhr-major-works-religion-and-politics,Reinhold Niebuhr: Major Works on Religion and Politics,"The indispensable Library of America, the most useful publishing venture in American letters, has produced an edition of Niebuhr’s major works, annotated by Niebuhr’s daughter, Elisabeth Sifton, a highly regarded editor and publisher. It belongs in the library of every student of U.S. foreign policy. Niebuhr, a Protestant pastor and theologian whose career stretched from World War I to the Vietnam era, was one of the United States’ keenest social thinkers. His approach to foreign policy, often known as “Christian realism,” was at bottom an attempt to bridge the gulf between the idealism promoted by American religious culture and the difficult choices that confronted a global superpower in an era of struggle against totalitarian regimes. For American thinkers such as George Kennan and Arthur Schlesinger, Jr.—to say nothing of President Barack Obama, whose 2009 Nobel Peace Prize acceptance speech was steeped in Niebuhrian thought—Niebuhr’s synthesis has offered an alternative to otherworldly idealism and cold-blooded Machiavellian realism."
14,African Americans in U.S. Foreign Policy: From the Era of Frederick Douglass to the Age of Obama,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2015-10-19/african-americans-us-foreign-policy-era-frederick-douglass-age,African Americans in U.S. Foreign Policy: From the Era of Frederick Douglass to the Age of Obama,"Young Americans might take for granted the presence of African Americans in high-level U.S. foreign policy circles; after all, the U.S. president and his national security adviser are black, and in the past decade, two African Americans have served as U.S. secretary of state. But it has been a long road, as this useful collection of essays by noted scholars reveals with its in-depth look at the history of African American international engagement going back to Frederick Douglass’ service as the U.S. minister to Haiti. One theme that links these essays is the difficult line African Americans have had to walk: on the one hand, they represent the government and people of the United States; on the other, they belong to a racial minority that has suffered greatly from both informal and legally sanctioned discrimination—and worse. Another common theme is the continuing hold of Africa on the imaginations of black Americans: one should expect the continuing rise of African Americans in the nation’s foreign policy establishment to result in closer ties between the United States and the countries of Africa."
15,The Obama Doctrine: American Grand Strategy Today,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2015-10-19/obama-doctrine-american-grand-strategy-today,The Obama Doctrine: American Grand Strategy Today,"Dueck’s book, which should be required reading for 2016 presidential candidates and their staffs, offers a critique of U.S. President Barack Obama’s foreign policy, an overview of the state of the foreign policy debate among Republican voters, and some foreign policy prescriptions that Dueck believes would help the eventual GOP candidate unite the Republicans and reach out to independents and some Democrats. Dueck argues that Obama has sought to be a transformational president—but in domestic rather than foreign policy. Obama’s overriding goal has been to prevent foreign policy entanglements from splitting his electoral coalition and diverting economic resources away from the nation building that he believes the United States needs to do at home. As for the GOP, Dueck sees a party divided into three factions: libertarian neo-isolationists, conservative internationalists, and conservative nationalists. The three groups command roughly equal support in the party, Dueck maintains, but conservative nationalists may prove decisive in the 2016 primaries. Dueck advises the next administration to embrace “conservative American realism,” an approach that focuses more on conserving the foundations of U.S. primacy than on transforming the world in the United States’ image."
16,Go Set a Watchman: A Novel,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2015-10-19/go-set-watchman-novel,Go Set a Watchman: A Novel,"Harper Lee’s novel To Kill a Mockingbird tells the story of Atticus Finch, a small-town Alabama lawyer who risks ostracism and violence to defend an obviously innocent African American man against a false charge of rape; the tale is narrated by Finch’s tomboy daughter, Scout. More than half a century after its publication, it remains one of the most popular works in the American canon. Yet some readers have objected over the years to what they deemed to be an excessively saintly portrayal of Finch. It turns out that prior to writing To Kill a Mockingbird, Lee wrote a different novel—featuring most of the same characters but set about two decades later—in which she wrestles with some of the ambiguities and shadows she tiptoes around in To Kill a Mockingbird. In Go Set a Watchman, Scout is forced to face harsh realities about race relations and about her family’s complicity in an ugly system when she finds her father at a White Citizens’ Council meeting planning resistance to racial integration. William Faulkner and Ralph Ellison wrote more profoundly than Lee about race in America, and Flannery O’Connor had a sharper eye for the South. Still, the grace and sincerity of Lee’s fiction have helped sharpen the consciences of millions of readers; many writers have published far more to far less effect."
17,Kissinger: 1923-1968: The Idealist,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2015-10-19/kissinger-1923-1968-idealist,Kissinger: 1923-1968: The Idealist,"Henry Kissinger is the most brilliant U.S. diplomat since World War II; he is also the most controversial. This first volume of Ferguson’s authorized biography of Kissinger ends in January 1969, when Richard Nixon had been elected as U.S. president but not inaugurated and Kissinger had been selected as Nixon’s national security adviser but not yet appointed. Ferguson argues that the young Kissinger was no Machiavellian realist, and he persuasively makes the case that Kissinger saw neither Metternich nor Bismarck as a model to emulate. In Ferguson’s account, Kissinger appears as a Kantian, rather than a Wilsonian, idealist who believes that the duty of a statesman is to choose among evils. Ferguson follows Kissinger as he streaked across the American intellectual sky like a meteor. He was already famous in the 1950s; during the Kennedy and Johnson years, he was already engaged in negotiations with North Vietnam. Every serious student of U.S. policy and history will want to read this compelling book about a towering figure."
18,The Right Way to Lose a War: America in an Age of Unwinnable Conflicts,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2015-10-19/right-way-lose-war-america-age-unwinnable-conflicts,The Right Way to Lose a War: America in an Age of Unwinnable Conflicts,"It is a sign of the times that Tierney’s brave and interesting book begins with the assumption that most contemporary wars are essentially unwinnable for the United States. This is because they are civil conflicts rather than interstate wars. The United States tends to find itself in uncomfortable positions when intervening in such conflicts, quickly looking for a way out; indigenous forces, by contrast, often know how to play the long game required by such situations. The simplest way to avoid unwinnable wars is not to engage in them in the first place, but Tierney is not sure it will always be possible for Washington to stay out. If intervention becomes necessary, Tierney urges U.S. officials to think carefully about the difficult security challenges that arise even after relatively easy initial combat successes and to remember the importance of a credible exit strategy. Tierney’s argument is imaginatively organized around a sequence he dubs “surge, talk, and leave”: strengthening one’s position before engaging in negotiations that might allow for a dignified departure."
19,Ghost Fleet: A Novel of the Next World War,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2015-10-19/ghost-fleet-novel-next-world-war,Ghost Fleet: A Novel of the Next World War,"Singer and Cole use this fast-paced tale of a hypothetical future war between the United States and a somewhat tentative Sino-Russian alliance to explore the vulnerabilities of advanced weapons systems and the advantages of more basic weaponry. After effectively blinding U.S. surveillance with cyberweapons, China attacks Pearl Harbor and occupies Hawaii. The “ghost fleet” of the title is a collection of mothballed U.S. ships whose outdated technology allows them to survive in an environment in which new systems are unable to operate. The ghost fleet—along with other old-fashioned weapons, such as patriotism, grit, and self-sacrifice—allows the United States to fight back. The authors have fun (and so does the reader) imagining a world shaped by the widespread use of stimulant drugs and Google Glass–like devices and in which women play vital combat roles. One problem is that it’s never quite clear why the war started, nor why the Russians joined the fight. As always, when drawing up scenarios for future wars, the hardest thing to do is make the politics credible."
20,"Objective Troy: A Terrorist, a President, and the Rise of the Drone",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2015-10-19/objective-troy-terrorist-president-and-rise-drone,"Objective Troy: A Terrorist, a President, and the Rise of the Drone","Targeted assassinations using drones raise questions not only of legality and morality but also of efficacy and prudence. The martyrdom of drone targets and the anger at the civilian casualties that drone attacks cause might arouse more militant activity than the assassinations prevent. And terrorists themselves might someday use drones. Shane illuminates these issues by examining U.S. President Barack Obama’s decision to approve the killing of a U.S. citizen in Yemen, Anwar al-Awlaki, whom U.S. intelligence suspected of having ties to al Qaeda. Shane suggests an intriguing parallel in Obama’s and Awlaki’s trajectories. Although Obama ultimately embraced targeting killing, he came to office wishing to build bridges with Muslim countries and troubled by how his predecessor had conducted the “war on terror.” For most of his life, Awlaki had seemed comfortable in the United States, and his initial response to the 9/11 attacks had been moderate. He became an unusually influential extremist preacher only after he fled the United States for Yemen on learning that the FBI had uncovered embarrassing details about his personal life while investigating his suspected connections to terrorists. Although clearly unhappy with Obama’s decision to authorize the assassination, Shane recognizes how difficult it would have been for the U.S. president to eschew one of the few means available for dealing directly with terrorist threats."
21,The Billion Dollar Spy: A True Story of Cold War Espionage and Betrayal,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2015-10-19/billion-dollar-spy-true-story-cold-war-espionage-and-betrayal,The Billion Dollar Spy: A True Story of Cold War Espionage and Betrayal,"Drawing on numerous interviews and recently declassified documents, Hoffman’s latest book is a must-read for aficionados of Cold War spy thrillers. Few other works describe in such detail what it meant to run American agents in Cold War–era Moscow: elaborate ruses to fool the KGB, tests to determine whether a promising new agent was in fact a plant, and constant tension between demands for more information and the need to protect agents. At the center of Hoffman’s story stands the Soviet radar expert Adolf Tolkachev, who was deeply disillusioned with the Soviet system and determined to hand over whatever secrets he could to the United States. To a remarkable degree, he succeeded—until 1985, when he was betrayed by a disgruntled CIA employee. The picture of Tolkachev that emerges is complex. He sought large payments for his help, not to spend the money but simply to demonstrate his worth, while also gratefully receiving kitschy tokens of Americana for his son. Not only was his information about Soviet technology valuable, but so was his example: he demonstrated that good intelligence could be collected by old-fashioned espionage as well as advanced technology."
22,After Hitler: The Last Ten Days of World War II in Europe,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2015-10-19/after-hitler-last-ten-days-world-war-ii-europe,After Hitler: The Last Ten Days of World War II in Europe,"This admirable book covers the last ten days of World War II in Europe, starting with April 30, 1945, the day of Hitler’s suicide, and concluding on May 9, by which point all German soldiers had surrendered. The book’s strength lies in Jones’ well-crafted account of the complex negotiations over the pace, manner, and location of the surrender. Admiral Karl Dönitz, Hitler’s anointed successor, believed that there were sufficient German fighters, still imbued with Nazi faith, to mount a rear-guard action to split the Allies. But most Germans, aware that the cause was hopelessly lost, sought to hand themselves over to the Americans, the British, or the Canadians—staying as far away as possible from the Russians. All the parties had an eye on how the conclusion of the war might shape the coming political struggles. Although Jones passes too lightly over the backstories of certain events, he skillfully uses diaries and other memoirs to vividly re-create dramatic moments: German civilians suddenly at the mercy of Soviet forces, British troops recoiling at the horror and degradation they found at Nazi concentration camps, and the camaraderie-filled first encounters between victorious troops from the East and the West."
23,International Organization in Time: Fragmentation and Reform,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2015-10-19/international-organization-time-fragmentation-and-reform,International Organization in Time: Fragmentation and Reform,"All large organizations tend to become bureaucratized and stodgy over time. Institutional inertia sets in, and vested interests resist change. Yet the rapidly changing world requires constructive adaptation. The private sector relies on competition (and occasional recessions) to shake firms out of their traditional ways. The public sector relies on innovative officials, sometimes prodded by parliamentary or congressional oversight—an imperfect process, especially when it comes to international organizations. Hanrieder’s perceptive book details several failed attempts to reform the World Health Organization by aiming to reverse the organization’s fragmentation and to introduce greater coherence into its policies and practices. A functional WHO should be a wholly uncontroversial, consensus goal; after all, everyone favors good health and the containment of contagious diseases. Yet the WHO has become factionalized by region and in some places has lapsed into patronage and inefficiency, which have proved difficult to overcome. Hanrieder also looks at mostly unsuccessful reform efforts at UNESCO and the International Labor Organization. Despite the book’s excessive use of political science jargon, its discouraging analysis is valuable and applicable to many organizations."
24,The Public Wealth of Nations: How Management of Public Assets Can Boost or Bust Economic Growth,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2015-10-19/public-wealth-nations-how-management-public-assets-can-boost-or,The Public Wealth of Nations: How Management of Public Assets Can Boost or Bust Economic Growth,"This significant book makes two simple but important points. First, government-owned assets typically exceed public debts, often by a large margin. Of the 33 countries for which estimates exist, only in Belgium and El Salvador does sovereign debt significantly exceed public assets. In all the other countries, assets exceed debt by at least 50 percent—and probably by much more than that, since assets are usually understated for various reasons. The second point is that public assets are typically poorly managed and therefore represent a promising source of new government revenue, if only states could figure out how to take better advantage of them. Detter and Folster draw on many concrete examples, especially from Singapore and Sweden, to show how governments can use public assets to increase revenue, reduce costs, and improve services. Restructuring and rationalizing public commercial enterprises to make them more efficient and revenue-minded would considerably reduce the pressure on constrained government budgets all over the world."
25,The Truth About Inflation,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2015-10-19/truth-about-inflation,The Truth About Inflation,"Inflation is usually considered simple, straightforward, and undesirable; that, at least, is the view promoted by many central bankers and some economists. Donovan counters that inflation is anything but straightforward and contends that whether it is good or bad depends on one’s circumstances. His book is a careful and sober attempt to dispel the many myths and half-truths that surround discussions of inflation, starting with how it is actually measured and how different measures are relevant for the young and the old, the rich and the poor, lenders and borrowers, and savers and investors. Contrary to common fears, governments do not typically allow inflation to grow in order to reduce the real value of their debts, even if they occasionally can do so; they usually find other ways to reduce their debt burdens. The author draws heavily on the British experience with inflation, but the same myths—and the same refutations—apply to most developed nations."
26,The Economics of Inequality,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2015-10-19/economics-inequality,The Economics of Inequality,"Piketty first published this book in French in 1997, long before he became famous. Translated into English for the first time, it offers an exceptionally clear, cogent, and coherent discussion of economic inequality. The analysis is necessarily technical in places, but Piketty carefully explains the technicalities. He draws heavily on data from France and the United States but also offers broader international comparisons. The book also takes some instructive excursions into topics such as savings and investment, education, affirmative action, unions, and the minimum wage. Mainly, however, Piketty is concerned with the debate between those who argue that serious attempts to redistribute income will result in everyone being worse off and those who claim that social justice requires redistribution in modern economies and can be achieved without inflicting widespread damage. Piketty is sympathetic to the social justice argument but recognizes that the economic details of redistribution are devilishly complicated and that efficient redistributive policies depend quite a bit on the context in which they are adopted and applied."
27,Other People's Money: The Real Business of Finance,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2015-10-19/other-peoples-money-real-business-finance,Other People’s Money: The Real Business of Finance,"This important book is simultaneously a clear primer on modern financial systems and a scathing indictment of them. It acknowledges the essential role of finance in modern economies but levels three critical charges at modern financial systems: they are larger than necessary, they perform inefficiently or worse, and they transfer unjustifiably large sums of money to the financial sector from the rest of the economy. Financial sectors have become self-referential systems, preoccupied with trading within the sector rather than providing services to households and nonfinancial firms. Along with offering this detailed diagnosis, Kay suggests some prescriptions: separate deposit-taking institutions from those that handle most other financial activities; require that financial firms maintain adequate levels of capital, which would lower returns on equity and eventually lead to a market-driven reduction in largely superfluous financial trading; and impose strict liability on managers, since those who are richly rewarded should take the rap for any malfeasance that happens on their watch—and ignorance should be no defense."
28,War and Democratic Constraint: How the Public Influences Foreign Policy,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/war-and-democratic-constraint-how-public-influences-foreign-policy,War and Democratic Constraint: How the Public Influences Foreign Policy,"This groundbreaking study examines the degree to which public opinion in democratic countries constrains leaders when it comes to foreign policy decisions—and finds a great degree of variability. A vivid recent illustration came in the run-up to the Iraq war, when British Prime Minister Tony Blair was able to resist strong domestic opposition and commit troops to the U.S.-led invasion while other European governments were not. Baum and Potter argue that the combination of potent partisan opposition and open media makes it harder for leaders to ignore popular dissent when it comes to decisions about the use of force. The authors analyze enormous amounts of data ranging from 1965 until 2006 and find that countries where information flowed most freely—stimulated by partisan politics and open media—were the least likely to initiate conflict. They also report that countries with more political parties have tended to generate more public opposition to wars and to contribute fewer troops to “coalitions of the willing.” The book’s most striking message is that although a “democratic constraint” does exist, it is fragile: antiwar publics can often be outmaneuvered by their leaders."
29,The Post-American Middle East,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/middle-east/2015-10-20/post-american-middle-east,The Post-American Middle East,"After generations of authoritarian stagnation punctuated by moments of domestic repression and interstate war, in recent years, the Middle East has begun to move. The rise of radical Islamism, the invasion of Iraq and its chaotic aftermath, the uprisings of the Arab Spring and their bloody issue, and now a sustained drop in oil prices and successful negotiations with Iran—together these have opened up what could be an unsettling new era for all involved. What are the contours of this new Middle East? Will Washington continue to pull back from actively managing the region, or will it develop an appetite for renewed intervention? And how will developments reshuffle alignments and allegiances? These are the questions this package tries to answer, delving deep into the current turmoil and its implications for U.S. policy. To start, Steven Simon and Jonathan Stevenson argue that the U.S. shift to an “offshore balancing” approach, shunning ground operations and state building in the region, has been driven by a sensible recognition that Washington has dramatically reduced scope for successful intervention these days. But Daniel Byman says that counterterrorism from a distance is not enough and that renewed attempts at state building are necessary. Michael Mandelbaum thinks that in order to deter Tehran from going nuclear, the Iran deal should be supplemented by an explicit threat of U.S. military action in response to significant cheating, and Cyrus Amir-Mokri and Hamid Biglari explain the economic policy changes the Islamic Republic needs to enact in order to reap lasting benefits from the lifting of international sanctions. Ali Khedery reports on the ongoing disintegration of Iraq, arguing that decentralization presents the least bad alternative for the country’s future, and Stephen Walt and Jared Cohen offer strategies for dealing with the Islamic State (also called ISIS) on the ground and in cyberspace, respectively. And Ilan Goldenberg and Melissa Dalton, Michael Wahid Hanna, and Natan Sachs trace the contours of the new dynamics between the United States and the Gulf Cooperation Council, Egypt, and Israel, respectively. The old Middle East has been seriously shaken; where it persists or has been restored, such as in Saudi Arabia and Egypt, it limps on without confidence or permanence. The new Middle East remains a work in progress; from Iraq and Syria to Libya and Yemen, nobody knows how things will look when the dust settles. And whether, after the nuclear deal kicks in, Iran will choose conflict, integration, or a mixture of the two remains a mystery. Stay tuned."
30,Imperialism Past and Present,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2015-10-19/imperialism-past-and-present,Imperialism Past and Present,"Empires have existed since ancient times, but the term “imperialism” came into use only in the 1860s, when it was coined to describe the extraordinary burst of worldwide competition among European powers for control of markets and territory. With the post–World War II spread of national independence movements in Asia and Africa, the age of empire seemed to end, and the term “imperialism” became less a descriptor than an epithet. Saccarelli and Varadarajan seek to recover the idea of imperialism as a system of global domination. In their view, imperialism remains a constant and abiding force, evolving to fit the era. Since the end of the Cold War, they argue, the United States has pursued “neo-imperialism,” made manifest in Washington’s wars and interventions in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, and elsewhere. The authors are surely right that global structures of power and domination did not disappear when the Cold War ended. But the book does not advance a coherent theory of imperialism that connects the dynamics of capitalism to contemporary European or U.S. foreign policies."

He is particularly good at situating the great theorists of sovereignty—Bodin, Grotius, Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau, Vattel, and Hegel—in their historical contexts. Along the way, Grimm illuminates the three great “revolutions” that brought the concept of sovereignty into the twentieth century: the rise of the state as an abstract entity, independent of religion or a specific monarch; the idea of popular sovereignty, manifest in the constitutional rule of law; and the globalization of sovereign territorial rule based on state formation. Like most other histories of sovereignty, Grimm’s is deeply Eurocentric. He only hints at the political explosiveness of the idea of sovereignty representing the “legal independence of states,” which was enshrined in the Westphalian settlement of 1648 and created a political logic in which the relationship between states was based on coordination rather than subordination. That subversive idea set the stage for the crumbling of empires and the spread of the Westphalian state system during the twentieth century."
32,The Country of First Boys,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2015-10-19/country-first-boys,The Country of First Boys,"Sen has always been an economist with a humanistic sensibility, exploring the fraught possibilities of human advancement through the spread of markets while maintaining a commitment to global social justice. The essays collected here cover a wide range of topics—poverty, war, trade, development, freedom, education—sometimes offering sweeping arguments about modernity and social change and at other times looking for insights in small places, such as a school for girls in India. Sen rejects the view of “antiglobalizers,” who claim that international trade inherently stacks the deck against weak and poor countries. Sen argues that the poor would be even worse off in closed societies, without access to technology, trade, and the political benefits of living in an open world. The challenge, Sen argues, is to organize the global political economy so that it will more widely distribute the benefits of globalization. Indeed, this is Sen’s most compelling message: markets are here to stay, but they can and should be embedded in wider systems of social support and protections that can bring the world closer to a more just—or at least more tolerable—global order."
33,The Question of Intervention: John Stuart Mill and the Responsibility to Protect,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2015-10-19/question-intervention-john-stuart-mill-and-responsibility-protect,The Question of Intervention: John Stuart Mill and the Responsibility to Protect,"Since the 1990s, in the wake of humanitarian emergencies, violent civil wars, and terrorist attacks, the tension between the norm of state sovereignty and the need to prevent atrocities has become more intense, forcing the UN and great powers to repeatedly ponder what circumstances, if any, justify international intervention. In this magisterial study, Doyle provides the most thoughtful and searching exploration yet of this dilemma. The book builds on John Stuart Mill’s classic 1859 essay on the norm of nonintervention and the prudential terms for its violation. Doyle finds Mills’ analysis flawed but sufficiently compelling to use as a starting point for the construction of a moral logic for liberal interventionism. He sifts through a rich array of cases from the nineteenth century to the present day to ascertain the costs and consequences of intervention, identifying circumstances that justify exceptions to and overrides of the nonintervention principle. Affirming the progress represented by the UN's “responsibility to protect” doctrine, which was formally articulated in 2005, Doyle makes the case for limited, cautious, and multilateral interventions that require both a license and a leash."

W. Bush administration, has written a book of vignettes about the 16 African heads of state with whom he had personal contact during his long career. Many of his portraits are unflattering, but Cohen is capable of real empathy, even when he is quite aware of a leader’s failings. An amusing set of anecdotes about President Léopold Sédar Senghor of Senegal—including one revolving around an improbable meal shared by Cohen, Senghor, and the American boxer Muhammad Ali—ends with the observation that Senghor was largely ignorant of the Senegalese countryside and did little to improve the welfare of his rural countrymen. Particularly interesting portraits emerge of Muammar al-Qaddafi of Libya, Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe, and Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire. Diplomatic historians will value the book’s substantive details. Other readers will be tickled by some of Cohen’s revelations: he reports, among other things, that Mobutu’s favorite ride at Disneyland, which the dictator visited in 1970, was one that featured an imitation Congo River, replete with electronic crocodiles."
35,Dictators and Democracy in African Development: The Political Economy of Good Governance in Nigeria,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2015-10-20/dictators-and-democracy-african-development-political-economy,Dictators and Democracy in African Development: The Political Economy of Good Governance in Nigeria,"Observers usually point to a standard set of factors to explain the failures of Nigeria, which has too often underperformed since winning its independence in 1960: poor leadership, ethnic heterogeneity, and the perverse effects of oil wealth. In this sweeping history of Nigerian politics and public policy, LeVan rejects those conventional explanations, arguing instead that the country has been undermined by the prevalence of “veto players,” which he defines as political and institutional actors—such as the legislature, powerful networks within the military, and regional pressure groups—that can block policy reform in order to gain private concessions for themselves. The more power veto players have enjoyed, the less Nigeria has been able to achieve desirable economic outcomes. LeVan’s thesis raises some questions, such as why the number of veto players varies across Nigeria’s postcolonial history. But he has written a provocative and insightful analysis of the Nigerian political economy that rings true."
36,Understanding Namibia: The Trials of Independence,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2015-10-20/understanding-namibia-trials-independence,Understanding Namibia: The Trials of Independence,"Since it achieved independence from South Africa in 1990, Namibia has generally been considered one of Africa’s more stable democracies, with regular multiparty elections, a progressive constitution, and seemingly robust personal freedoms. Melber, a veteran member of the country’s entrenched governing party, the South West Africa People’s Organization (SWAPO), casts a much more critical look at Namibia’s record. He argues that SWAPO has become too dominant, too willing to use state resources to maintain its grip on power, and too thin-skinned. His criticism of the country’s economic policies is even harsher. He complains that the state has done little to reduce the high levels of inequality bequeathed by the pre-independence white minority-rule government. SWAPO’s management of the country’s significant land, mining, and marine resources has mostly served to create a new, black oligarchy. Melber ends his compelling account by pondering the future. In a country where a majority of the population is under 30 years old, the swapo leadership increasingly looks like a gerontocracy. But Melber believes its hold on power is secure for now."

Her focus is Chad. Around 15 years ago, in exchange for financial support from the World Bank, Chad agreed to a number of restrictions on the use of its oil revenues, promising to use its newfound wealth to improve the welfare of its population. But Chad broke its pledges and ultimately turned to China, which offered help in developing Chad’s oil sector with far fewer strings attached. Hicks’ detailed account, which also looks at the role of oil in Ghana, Kenya, Niger, and Uganda, provides reasons for both optimism and pessimism. On the one hand, increasingly well-informed media and civil society organizations in those countries have ensured that oil contracts, revenues, and environmental problems are discussed much more frankly and knowledgeably than in the past. On the other hand, decision-making in these new oil sectors remains top-down and thus vulnerable to corruption."

But it produced few countries in which presidents did not continue to enjoy extraconstitutional advantages come election time. In this short but thorough book, Cheeseman recounts the breakdown of authoritarian governance in the 1980s, the emergence of opposition movements and parties, the process of reforms, and the obstacles to democratic consolidation. One particularly thoughtful chapter focuses on institutional arrangements that different countries have used to address ethnic tensions. Cheeseman uses lively case studies to support his main arguments and delves into the recent academic literature on this topic to assess current trends and make predictions about the future. He eschews much of the pessimism about African democracy that is fashionable today, instead offering a lucid and balanced account of both achievements and failures."

For many years, Thondup was the go-to Tibetan interlocutor for foreign governments and China. The book is full of tales of international intrigue, recounting Thondup’s meetings in the 1950s with Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and the Taiwanese leader Chiang Kai-shek, who Thondup says personally paid for him to attend college. Thondup also claims that he was the CIA’s contact person in Tibet and that he even managed the agency’s clandestine base in Nepal. Later, when Deng Xiaoping came to power in China, Thondup writes that he was summoned to Beijing to discuss renewed negotiations between China and the Dalai Lama. Still, Thondup offers very few substantial revelations about Tibet’s recent history. And the book is marred by speculation that verges on conspiracy theorizing; indeed, in a postscript, Thondup’s co-author, Thurston, actually questions the veracity of Thondup’s story. In Thondup’s telling, the 1987–89 protests in Tibet were engineered by foreign governments and Beijing’s negotiations with the Dalai Lama were sabotaged by the Indian government. These are fascinating allegations, but Thondup offers little evidence to support them."

Lee draws on French colonial archives and interviews to show how the Hmongs—a hill people scattered across Laos, Thailand, Vietnam, and parts of southern China—have oscillated between submission to and rebellion against superior forces: French colonizers, the Laotian royal government, the Japanese occupiers during World War II, and later the local communist movements and the Americans. The messianism of the Hmong rebellions, the fractiousness of the Hmong clans, and the opportunism of Hmong relations with other forces mystified colonial powers and have puzzled historians ever since. But Lee, herself a member of the Hmong diaspora, makes sense of these behaviors as she deciphers the community’s myths, symbols, lineage ties, sexual politics, and rituals, with the combined skills of a historian and an anthropologist."

The authors think this explains the two countries’ difficulty in getting along despite shared democratic values and similar threat perceptions. Realists might counter that divergences in the two countries’ strategies for handling the threats posed by China and North Korea are a better explanation for the lack of cooperation. But both explanations recognize that part of the problem lies in the hub-and-spoke alliance system that the United States built in Asia after World War II, which links each ally separately to Washington without fostering ties among them. To overcome this deficiency, the authors recommend building on existing low-level forms of cooperation. In the longer term, they hope for a reset in which all three sides would acknowledge historical wrongs and agree to look toward the future. Although few of its facts are new, the book offers a useful overview of an important trilateral relationship."

No wonder the relationship has frequently disappointed Pakistani hopes. China stood by when Indian troops helped dismember Pakistan during the 1971 rebellion in East Pakistan (now Bangladesh). China helped Pakistan get nuclear weapons in order to weaken the Indian nuclear threat to China, but then lobbied against Pakistani adventurism that risked triggering a war with India. It encouraged Pakistan to sponsor jihadist militants to attack the Soviets in Afghanistan, but then pressured Pakistan to rein in the jihadists who were targeting Chinese rule in Xinjiang. Today, China needs Pakistan to anchor Chinese plans to develop infrastructure in South Asia and Central Asia, but China will not get deeply involved enough in Pakistan to fix the instability that renders that country a risky venue for investment. Given the frustrations of both sides, the relationship described in this exceptionally well-informed and insightful account does not yet qualify as an “axis.”"

China conducts a great deal of industrial espionage, but its enterprises have a hard time filtering and applying the vast amount of data their hackers steal. Looking only at the Chinese side of the relationship, the book does not detail the digital threats that the United States poses to China. But Chinese thinkers believe they are significant, and given China’s strategic doctrine of striking first and massively, this creates the risk that in a crisis, Beijing might launch a preemptive cyberattack. The fact that Chinese and Western experts cooperated in this pathbreaking book shows that there is a potential for working together. But there are many obstacles, including the inherent secrecy of the field."

But as Lynch reveals, there are real, if narrower, debates taking place inside the system, mostly among academics and think-tank staffers writing in policy journals and classified newsletters. On economics, much of the commentary runs counter to the regime’s happy talk, pointing to problems such as an aging work force, the politicized allocation of credit, and government control of the land market. On international relations, by contrast, many specialists express what Lynch calls a “belle-époque hubris,” urging the government to be even more assertive than it already is. Commentators on domestic politics do not challenge one-party rule, but some call for more “inner-party democracy,” while others view authoritarianism as a developmental stage that will lead to democracy, and a third group is even more rigid than the Chinese Communist Party itself, portraying the current system as perfectly suited to Chinese culture. No one knows the extent to which these debates influence policy, but this skillful inquiry shows how informed insiders see China’s possible future trajectories."

They were typically drawn into this type of work by encounters with clients who had been tortured into false confessions or who had lost their houses to corrupt developers. As they were radicalized by the Kafkaesque obstacles they confronted in court, these “rights protection” lawyers (as they are known in China) developed a strategy of “taking the play for the real”: arguing their cases as if the legal system were independent and using the inevitable defeats to show that it is not. Pils provides extraordinary insight into how the government controls lawyers through a mix of bureaucratic procedures and extralegal coercion and how the legal system works against citizens when their claims challenge official prerogatives. Despite the regime’s recent emphasis on “building the rule of law,” the government recently detained virtually all of China’s rights-protection lawyers and indicated that it will try some of them for crimes such as “inciting subversion of state power.”"

Farrall, a former Australian intelligence analyst, and Hamid, an Egyptian who traveled to Afghanistan to fight the Soviets in 1979 and remained involved in jihadist circles there for the next two decades, actually had a chance to communicate over a four-year period, over the Internet and in person. In the conversations between them collected in this book, Hamid recounts how, once ensconced in Afghanistan, Osama bin Laden was influenced by young Arab extremists who were more enthralled by martyrdom than by building an Islamic society. Partly as a result, bin Laden adopted an international agenda, declaring war against the United States in 1996 and sponsoring the 9/11 attacks in 2001. This strategy proved to be a disaster for his Taliban hosts and, ultimately, for al Qaeda. Hamid saw bin Laden as a man of integrity, with deep pockets and very poor judgment. According to Hamid, bin Laden had no strategy other than to lure the United States into direct combat, and he did not realize that the war with the Soviets was not a model for a war with the Americans."

He covers history, doctrinal issues, the symbiosis of the ruling family with the Wahhabi clergy, and everyday Islamic practice in the realms of education, moral standards, law, charity, and gender. Commins  is scrupulously nonjudgmental. He stresses, as have others, that the deal between the clergy and the House of Saud remains solid: the Wahhabis continue to eschew any kind of political challenge in return for state sponsorship of their school of belief and practice. As a result, Commins notes, Wahhabism has been superimposed for two centuries on a society that was traditionally much more plural, with important roles for Shiites and Sufi mystics. Because the kingdom is the protector of the holy cities of Mecca and Medina, and because of Saudi Arabia’s enormous oil wealth, Wahhabism has been punching above its weight in the Muslim world. There is an inherent tension, however: the kingdom relies on the United States to protect its oil wealth, and the Wahhabis view such reliance as tantamount to apostasy."

They examine six Muslim-majority countries—Indonesia, Iran, Pakistan, Senegal, Tunisia, and Turkey—that enjoy some degree of democratic practice or tradition and also look at one autocracy, Egypt. They explain why some of these countries are more democratic than others by pointing to contingent factors involving military influence, economic conditions, and external actors. But their survey is incomplete: the vast differences in socioeconomic conditions among the seven is not systematically examined. Moreover, the authors make scant reference to the relative absence of democracy in the Arab world. Nor do they take into account quantitative analyses correlating the absence of democracy with the presence of Islam. Of the countries they study, the most stable appear to be Indonesia, where most Muslims practice a syncretic version of Islam, and Senegal, where relatively moderate Sufi orders prevail."

He argues that the vast majority of the globe’s 1.6 billion Muslims are inspired by “midstream” Islam, which is humanistic and democratic, eschewing violence except in self-defense. Baker asserts the existence of this midstream without providing much empirical evidence. He appears untroubled that its leading clerical figures—such as Alija Izetbegovic in Bosnia, Mohammad Hussein Fadlallah in Lebanon, Yusuf al-Qaradawi in Qatar, and Rachid al-Ghannouchi in Tunisia—are either dead or very old. Moreover, the only book Baker points to that might qualify as a middle-of-the-road manifesto—A Contemporary Islamic Vision: Declaration of Principles, by the moderate Egyptian Islamist attorney Ahmed Kamal Abul Magd—was published in 1991. In Baker’s portrait, most of the world’s Muslims are constantly searching for justice and resisting injustice, whose main source is the United States and its quest for empire. But Baker’s depiction of U.S. policy is a caricature. For Baker, Washington’s thirst for oil, desire for more military bases, and devotion to Israel mean that the United States cannot tolerate an Islam “which embodies the cosmic human struggle for justice in the face of evil.”"

To atone for her country’s involvement, she volunteered to work for the Coalition Provisional Authority, which was set up by the Americans to govern Iraq. She ended up spending six years in Iraq, first as the senior cpa civilian official in Kirkuk and then as a political adviser to the U.S. generals running the war; she worked especially closely with General Raymond Odierno. Like many soldiers and journalists who hang out in combat zones, she became addicted to the tension and loyal to her colleagues. The book is a fast-paced diary based entirely on her recollections and enlivened by her skillful character sketches. But it doesn’t shed much new light: in line with other, more analytic accounts of the war, Sky’s narrative suggests that Iraq’s “unraveling” was not inevitable but rather the result of poor decisions on the part of clumsy leaders. She faults Washington—and in particular U.S. Vice President Joe Biden—for trusting too much in Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki. “Biden was a nice man,” Sky writes, “but he simply had the wrong instincts on Iraq.”"

He knows this academic field well and is fluent in its key arguments, but he also spent two years in the places where these wars occurred and among those who fought them. This kind of firsthand research gives his analysis real heft. In both cases, it was not the eventual triumph of state authority, the clear defeat of one side, the disarming of the warring parties, or the arbitration of international mediators that allowed the conflict to end, as many theorists would assume. Rather, he argues, it was the deals that opposing warlords worked out among themselves, based on the bounty they could share, in a system that tolerated or even exploited their avarice—not least because they frequently came to constitute the state. In both cases, Russia acted not as an honest broker but as a source of the spoils of war."

In Russia’s case, the most familiar images of migration involve Siberian exile, Stalin’s gulag, and savage forced resettlements. Siegelbaum and Moch argue that, in reality, throughout three distinct periods in Russian history—the late imperial era, the Soviet years, and today—the phenomenon has been far more complex. During the twentieth century, most of the people who moved about the vast Russian territory—settlers, “career migrants,” evacuees, military recruits, and deportees—did so at the state’s behest. But many others, such as seasonal workers, refugees, and itinerant laborers, often migrated for their own, often compelling reasons. Whether people were coerced into moving or did so voluntarily, they developed distinctive ways of dealing with displacement. The authors address what all this movement meant to these different groups and to society at large, offering insights into a little-understood aspect of Russian history."

Here, he offers a manual of sorts on what the Ukrainian government and its international benefactors must do if Ukraine is to claw its way out of its current economic crisis. Reforms, he argues, must be “radical, comprehensive, and front-loaded,” noting that “all gradual reforms in crisis situations have failed.” The eu must step forward with an aid package as ambitious as the Marshall Plan. But political reform must come first, and Aslund details the progress Ukraine has achieved on that front in the past two years. Still, much remains to be done, and he urges campaign finance reform, the elimination of parliamentary immunity, and the decentralization of economic and political power. Those steps will pave the way for deeper changes: new anticorruption policies and practices, measures to achieve financial stability and sustainability, the transformation of the energy sector, and new social policy. In all these areas, Aslund proposes concrete steps based on his deep experience."
55,The End of the Cold War: 1985–1991,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2015-10-20/end-cold-war-1985-1991,The End of the Cold War: 1985–1991,"Service takes the vast literature on the Cold War’s end, adds newly available archival sources, and pulls it all together into a single massive history of how “Washington and Moscow achieved their improbable peace.” Instead of taking a side in the simplistic debate over whether Soviet Premier Mikhail Gorbachev’s revolution in Soviet foreign policy or U.S. President Ronald Reagan’s initial hard line deserves more credit for the outcome, Service chooses a subtler middle ground, crediting both sides. He commends the skill and flexibility of Gorbachev, Reagan, and two other men: U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze, both of whom Service places at the center of his story. The narrative weaves between the diplomatic action on multiple fronts and the political maneuvering in the United States and the Soviet Union. To cover as many elements as Service does requires very tight writing, even in a big book such as this one: as a result, he settles for sentences rather than paragraphs to cover the necessary ground."
56,The Brothers: The Road to an American Tragedy,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2015-10-20/brothers-road-american-tragedy,The Brothers: The Road to an American Tragedy,"Given the media attention lavished on the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing, it’s understandable that readers might wonder what more there is to learn. Everything, it turns out. Gessen, in this exquisitely well-told story of Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev, the brothers who carried out the attack, surrounds the awful event with layer upon layer of meaning. Gessen’s own Russian background helps her unravel the immensely complicated vagabond existence of the Tsarnaev family. Like many of their fellow Chechens—a people Stalin uprooted in the last stages of World War II and shipped in cattle cars to Central Asia—the Tsarnaevs struggled to find a place, first in Russia and ultimately in the United States, where they and their children could enjoy upward mobility. Gessen is personally familiar with the Russian immigrant experience and sketches with special insight how it went so awry in this case. She skillfully reconstructs and narrates the bombing and its aftermath, but it is her dogged determination to talk to everyone overseas and in the United States who knew the family that makes the book so startling and eye opening."
57,Stalin: New Biography of a Dictator,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2015-10-20/stalin-new-biography-dictator,Stalin: New Biography of a Dictator,"It’s unusual for two masterpieces to appear within less than a year of each other on a subject that has already been pored over by countless writers from nearly every angle. That has now happened with two books about Joseph Stalin. The first was Stephen Kotkin’s Stalin: Paradoxes of Power, the initial volume in a projected trilogy. And now appears Khlevniuk’s superb book, a deeply informed and utterly compelling biography, written by a careful Russia historian who knows the relevant archival material better than any other scholar. Khlevniuk’s fine filter lets through only the essentials; what he highlights is so frequently new and revealing that the portrait  in the end seems more accurate and complete than anything before. Stalin and the country that produced him—and that he then harshly refashioned—emerge with stunning clarity. The integrity of Khlevniuk’s account comes from his refusal to speculate beyond where hard evidence carries him. Favorov’s masterful translation from the Russian preserves the book’s spare, penetrating prose."
58,How the Gringos Stole Tequila: The Modern Age of Mexico’s Most Traditional Spirit,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2015-10-20/how-gringos-stole-tequila-modern-age-mexicos-most-traditional,How the Gringos Stole Tequila: The Modern Age of Mexico’s Most Traditional Spirit,"Martineau journeys through Mexico interviewing producers of the agave-based spirits tequila and mescal. She’s dismayed that international beverage distributors now design and market Mexico’s signature alcoholic drinks and that techniques of mass production too often sacrifice integrity and authenticity. She is appalled at the bottling of exported bulk tequila in the United States—which consumes roughly twice as much tequila as Mexico itself—and the potential loss of quality control it represents. She mocks celebrity endorsements of brands, although she approves of the actor George Clooney donating the profits from the sales of his Casamigos tequila to humanitarian aid projects in Sudan. She is excited by the resurgence of mescal, which has retained more of its traditional methods and terroir. Upscale mescal has become the hip drink of sophisticated young Mexicans who wish to celebrate their national or pre-Colombian roots. An appendix lists Martineau’s choices for the best-made tequilas and mescals. She is particularly fond of the brand Siete Leguas: “earthy and sweet, bursting with cooked agave flavors and hints of spice.”"
59,Latin American Cinema,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2015-10-20/latin-american-cinema,Latin American Cinema,"To give some structure to this collection of his brief but insightful movie reviews, Hart argues that there have been three fundamental periods in Latin American cinema: the New Latin American Cinema (1951–75), influenced by Italian neorealism; the “nation-image” era (1976–99), which recorded the brutal military regimes of the time; and the “slick grit” period (2000–2014), when the retreat of state subsidies forced directors to up their games and seek commercial success (think of the popular directors Guillermo del Toro and Alejandro González Iñárritu). But there are several themes common to these three periods: the “featurementary,” a merger of fiction and documentary; the use of nonprofessional actors and filming on location; and left-wing politics, sometimes blended into crime thrillers or science fiction, which has distinguished Latin American cinema from the ideologically barren fare Hollywood usually produces. Latin America has given the world so many great movies that one can almost forgive Hart for omitting from his survey such classics as Lucía, a 1968 Cuban film, and Midaq Alley, a 1995 Mexican film starring Salma Hayek. He also quickly passes by the stirring Mexican melodramas starring Dolores del Rio and María Félix, although he recognizes in those films the roots of the fabulously popular telenovelas (Latin American soap operas) that have captivated audiences worldwide."
60,"¡Cuba, Cuba! 65 Years of Photography",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2015-10-20/cuba-cuba-65-years-photography,"¡Cuba, Cuba! 65 Years of Photography","The over 100 photographs and political posters in this exhibit capture playful, criminal, heroic, mundane, and melancholic moments from the last 65 years of Cuban history. Drawing on several collections featuring Cuban and American artists, the exhibit’s curators, the Cuban art historian Iliana Cepero and Pauline Vermare of the International Center of Photography (ICP), avoid easy stereotypes and instead artfully present Cuba’s tensions and complexities. One stunning image shows the American mobster-entrepreneur Meyer Lansky dressed in a white tuxedo jacket, smiling broadly in the lobby of the iconic Hotel Habana Riviera, which he owned. Another striking photograph, with echoes of Eugène Delacroix’s painting Liberty Leading the People, captures Cuban revolutionaries on horseback, galloping toward American-owned sugar estates that they presumably plan to seize and nationalize. Images from the 1970s and 1980s reflect Soviet-style appeals to hard work, but the Cuban laborers depicted in them retain their dignity. Present-day Cuba is pictured as fragmented, exhausted, and overwhelmed by daily deprivations. The collection omits images of Cuban President Raúl Castro and his ruling Communist Party colleagues, perhaps because they are less accessible and less colorful. The ICP hopes the exhibit will travel throughout the United States and Cuba."
61,Empire’s Crossroads: A History of the Caribbean From Columbus to the Present Day,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2015-10-20/empires-crossroads-history-caribbean-columbus-present-day,Empire’s Crossroads: A History of the Caribbean From Columbus to the Present Day,"The Caribbean—to which parts of the southern coast of the United States arguably belong—is full of places that lag behind economically. Are there common causes for their misfortunes? Gibson’s social history focuses heavily on the destructive legacy of slavery, the bitter divisiveness of racism, and the brutality and inequalities of the opulent sugar plantations that dominated Caribbean economies for 300 years. The imperial powers and their commercial enterprises benefited mightily from the region’s resources—Europe’s Industrial Revolution was financed with sugar money—often with callous disregard for the suffering of native populations. This is a somewhat familiar story, but Gibson tells it in fluid, colorful prose peppered with telling anecdotes. She takes note of the region’s many despots but does not underscore poor governance as a driving force behind the region’s disappointing performance. She also asserts, not quite convincingly, that the Caribbean remains a crossroads at the center of human history: it’s more likely that the mostly small island states of the region will continue to struggle for the attention of the world’s bigger powers and that they will have to learn to make better use of their own resources to survive in today’s fiercely competitive global economy."
62,"Latin America and the Rising South: Changing World, Changing Priorities",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2015-10-20/latin-america-and-rising-south-changing-world-changing-priorities,"Latin America and the Rising South: Changing World, Changing Priorities","In the 1960s, economic theorists divided the world into a hegemonic industrialized “North” and an exploited and impoverished “South.” In this dense, data-rich milestone of a study, a group of World Bank experts argue that the rise of the Southern economies—including those of Brazil, Mexico, and other countries in Latin America—has disrupted this simple dichotomy and created a more differentiated and intertwined international economy. (In the financial sphere, however, the Northern capital centers—New York, London, Frankfurt, and Tokyo—retain their traditional dominance.) As an increasingly globalized region, Latin America depends for its future on the extent and quality of its external connections. In reaffirming the value of openness, the authors argue that trade and investment boost growth not only through efficiency gains but also by serving as conduits for learning and technology diffusion, which in turn depend on where countries fit into global supply chains. In a finding certain to raise hackles in some parts of the developing world, the study argues that “trade linkages with the North could indeed yield higher growth payoffs than trade with the South.”"
63,Keeping Up With the Caliphate,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/review-essay/2015-11-01/keeping-caliphate,Keeping Up With the Caliphate,"In June 2014, a small force of Islamic extremists routed the Iraqi army and seized control of Mosul, Iraq’s second-largest city. The militants then swept south, capturing Tikrit, until they occupied an area the size of the United Kingdom stretching across eastern Syria and northwestern Iraq. The militants, who had previously called themselves the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham, or ISIS, declared themselves the Islamic State and pledged allegiance to a mysterious figure named Abu Bakr al- Baghdadi. Clad in a black turban and flowing black robes, Baghdadi addressed the world for the first time that July and announced the reestablishment of the caliphate, the kingdom of God on earth."
64,A Nudge Too Far,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/nudge-too-far,A Nudge Too Far,"Lawyers may reign in Washington, D.C., but it is economists who drive the policymaking process. In July 2009, for example, Douglas Elmendorf, the economist who headed the Congressional Budget Office, nearly derailed the Affordable Care Act (also known as Obamacare) when he announced that, as drafted, the legislation would not “reduce the trajectory of federal health spending by a significant amount”—contradicting assurances made by the law’s supporters, who had to scramble to make changes to the bill. Economists also dominate in academia, so much so that scholars in the other social sciences call economics “the imperial discipline,” decrying its tendency to intrude beyond its proper boundaries."

In his new book, The Court and the World, he sets forth his views on the interaction between the U.S. legal system and the legal systems of other countries."
66,How to Be a Jew  in France,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/how-be-jew-france,How to Be a Jew  in France,"Just two days after the terrorist attack at the offices of the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo last January, Amedy Coulibaly, a French-born militant who had pledged allegiance to the self-proclaimed Islamic State (also known as ISIS), murdered four Jewish shoppers in a kosher supermarket in eastern Paris. Coulibaly’s heinous act was not without precedent. In 2014, Mehdi Nemmouche, a French citizen who had spent a year training with the Islamic State in Syria, opened fire in the Jewish Museum of Belgium, killing four. In 2012, Mohamed Merah, a French follower of al Qaeda, killed three children and a rabbi at a Jewish school in Toulouse."
67,Food and the Transformation of Africa,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/africa/2015-10-16/food-and-transformation-africa,Food and the Transformation of Africa,African agriculture has long been a symbol of the continent’s poverty. Officials considered the hundreds of millions of African smallholder farmers too backward to thrive; the future would arrive not by investing in them but rather by bypassing them. But all that is changing.
68,High Hopes for Hydrogen,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/high-hopes-hydrogen,High Hopes for Hydrogen,"The appeal of hydrogen fuel cells has long been obvious. Because these devices use electrochemical reactions to generate electricity from hydrogen, emitting only heat and water in the process, they offer a particularly green source of power, especially for vehicles. What has not been so obvious, however, is how to make hydrogen fuel cells practical. In 2009, Steven Chu, then the U.S. secretary of energy, told an interviewer that in order for hydrogen fuel-cell transportation to work, “four miracles” needed to happen. First, scientists had to find an efficient and low-cost way to produce hydrogen. Second, they had to develop a safe, high-density method of storing hydrogen in automobiles. Third, an infrastructure for distributing hydrogen had to be built so that fuel-cell vehicles would have ample refueling options. Fourth, researchers had to improve the capacity of the fuel-cell systems themselves, which were not as durable, powerful, and low cost as the internal combustion engine. Chu concluded that achieving all four big breakthroughs would be unlikely. “Saints only need three miracles,” he added."
69,Delusions of  Grand Strategy,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/united-states/delusions-grand-strategy,Delusions of  Grand Strategy,"In February 2015, when U.S. President Barack Obama released his second and final National Security Strategy—a formal outline of the administration’s foreign policy—it was met with the usual fanfare. Critics and defenders debated its principles and priorities. Prospective presidential candidates piggybacked off the release to highlight their own security agendas, hoping to score political points and broadcast their resolve. Others were simply relieved that the president, who often seemed allergic to explaining his grand strategy, had given voice to one."
70,Rank Has Its Privileges,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/world/rank-has-its-privileges,Rank Has Its Privileges,"When the Berlin-based group Transparency International released its annual ranking of international corruption levels in December 2014, China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs responded with a blistering statement. Chinese authorities were upset that their country had sunk from 80th to 100th place on the watchdog’s influential Corruption Perceptions Index, even though Beijing was pursuing a high-profile anticorruption campaign. “As a fairly influential international organization,” a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson said, “Transparency International should seriously examine the objectiveness and impartiality of its Corruption Perceptions Index.”"
71,Littler England,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/western-europe/littler-england,Littler England,"In the last year, some 39,000 migrants, mostly from North Africa, tried to make their way to the United Kingdom from the French port of Calais by boarding trucks and trains crossing the English Channel. In response, the British government attempted to secure the entrance to the tunnel in Calais, dispatching two and a half miles of security fencing that had been used for the 2012 Olympics and the 2014 NATO summit."
72,Help Refugees  Help Themselves,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/levant/2015-10-20/help-refugees-help-themselves,Help Refugees  Help Themselves,"There are now some 60 million displaced people around the world, more than at any time since World War II. The Syrian crisis alone, which has created the largest refugee shock of the era, has displaced some ten million people, around four million of them across international borders. In recent months, Western attention has focused almost exclusively on the flood of these refugees to Europe. Yet most of the Syrian refugees have been taken in not by Western countries but by Syria’s neighboring states: Jordan, Lebanon, and Turkey, whose capacity has been overwhelmed. Lebanon, with a population of around four million and a territory smaller than Maryland, is hosting over a million Syrian refugees. Young people are overrepresented in the refugee population, so that more than half of the school-aged children in Lebanon are now Syrian."
73,Why Israel Waits,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/israel/2015-10-20/why-israel-waits,Why Israel Waits,"Israeli national security strategy can seem baffling. Many observers in the United States and Europe, for example, wonder how Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu could have warned for years that Iran’s nuclear program posed an existential threat to Israel yet has balked at the international community’s attempts to defang it. By raising concerns about the nuclear deal between Iran and five great powers without offering a convincing alternative, Netanyahu has appeared to oppose any solution at all. Instead, as Philip Hammond, the British foreign secretary, said in July, Netanyahu is acting as though he would prefer a “permanent state of standoff” with Tehran."
74,Getting  Over Egypt,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/egypt/2015-11-01/getting-over-egypt,Getting  Over Egypt,"For decades, the partnership between Egypt and the United States was a linchpin of the American role in the Middle East. Today, it is a mere vestige of a bygone era. There are no longer any compelling reasons for Washington to sustain especially close ties with Cairo. What was once a powerfully symbolic alliance with clear advantages for both sides has become a nakedly transactional relationship—and one that benefits the Egyptians more than the Americans. The time has come for both sides to recognize that reality and for the United States to fundamentally alter its approach to Egypt: downgrading the priority it places on the relationship, reducing the level of economic and military support it offers Cairo, and more closely tying the aid it does deliver to political, military, and economic reforms that would make Egypt a more credible partner."
75,Bridging the Gulf,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/middle-east/bridging-gulf,Bridging the Gulf,"The events of the past five years have put an intense strain on the relationship between the United States and its traditional partners in the Arab world, particularly the countries that belong to the Gulf Cooperation Council: Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. As popular revolts have flared up across the Middle East, civil wars have broken out, and the regional order has become increasingly vulnerable, leaders in Washington and in Arab capitals have often had starkly different reactions. Meanwhile, most of the GCC countries have watched nervously—and sometimes angrily—as the United States has negotiated with their bitter rival, Iran, over an agreement to limit the Iranian nuclear program."
76,Digital Counterinsurgency,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/middle-east/digital-counterinsurgency,Digital Counterinsurgency,"The Islamic State, or ISIS, is the first terrorist group to hold both physical and digital territory: in addition to the swaths of land it controls in Iraq and Syria, it dominates pockets of the Internet with relative impunity. But it will hardly be the last. Although there are still some fringe terrorist groups in the western Sahel or other rural areas that do not supplement their violence digitally, it is only a matter of time before they also go online. In fact, the next prominent terrorist organization will be more likely to have extensive digital operations than control physical ground."
77,ISIS as Revolutionary State,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/middle-east/2015-11-01/isis-revolutionary-state,ISIS as Revolutionary State,"To many who have witnessed  its brutal tactics and religious extremism, the Islamic State, or ISIS, seems uniquely baffling and unusually dangerous. According to its leaders’ own statements, the group wants to eliminate infidels, impose sharia worldwide, and hasten the arrival of the Mahdi. ISIS' foot soldiers have pursued these goals with astonishing cruelty. Yet unlike the original al Qaeda, which showed little interest in controlling territory, ISIS has also sought to build the rudiments of a genuine state in the territory it controls. It has established clear lines of authority, tax and educational systems, and a sophisticated propaganda operation. It may call itself a “caliphate” and reject the current state-based international system, but a territorial state is what its leaders are running. As Jürgen Todenhöfer, a German journalist who visited territory in Iraq and Syria controlled by ISIS, said in 2014, “We have to understand that ISIS is a country now.”"
78,A Windfall for Iran?,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/iran/2015-10-20/windfall-iran,A Windfall for Iran?,"Over the past few years, the nuclear issue has dominated news about Iran. The landmark deal recently agreed to between Iran and the United States and other world powers sets out arrangements for handling that issue, but it leaves open many other questions about Iran’s future course. One of the most fundamental questions is what path Iran will follow after the sanctions have been lifted: Will it open itself up to the world, fulfilling the country’s economic potential, or will the country’s influential conservative elite thwart global engagement? Iran’s choice will have profound geopolitical implications and will shape the country’s role in the world over the coming decades."
79,Beyond Counterterrorism,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/united-states/beyond-counterterrorism,Beyond Counterterrorism,"When the Obama administration looks at the Middle East, it does so through the lens of counterterrorism. A systematic emphasis on the subject has underscored not just the administration’s relentless pursuit of al Qaeda and its new focus on the self-proclaimed Islamic State (or ISIS) but also a wider swath of its foreign policy, from its drone campaign in northwestern Pakistan to its maintenance of the detention facility in Guantánamo Bay, Cuba."
80,The End of Pax Americana,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/middle-east/end-pax-americana,The End of Pax Americana,"The Obama administration has clearly pulled back from the United States’ recent interventionism in the Middle East, notwithstanding the rise of the Islamic State (also known as ISIS) and the U.S.-led air war against it. Critics pin the change on the administration’s aversion to U.S. activism in the region, its unwillingness to engage in major combat operations, or President Barack Obama’s alleged ideological preference for diminished global engagement. But the reality is that Washington’s post-9/11 interventions in the region—especially the one in Iraq—were anomalous and shaped false perceptions of a “new normal” of American intervention, both at home and in the region. The administration’s unwillingness to use ground forces in Iraq or Syria constitutes not so much a withdrawal as a correction—an attempt to restore the stability that had endured for several decades thanks to American restraint, not American aggressiveness."
81,Iraq in Pieces,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/iraq/2015-09-22/iraq-pieces,Iraq in Pieces,"American leaders contemplating Iraq have made a habit of substituting unpleasant realities with rosy assessments based on questionable assumptions. In 1991, after the Gulf War, the George H. W. Bush administration hoped that Iraqis would rise up against Saddam Hussein and encouraged them to do so, only to abandon them to the Republican Guard. In 1998, President Bill Clinton signed the Iraq Liberation Act, officially embracing regime change and transferring millions of dollars to an Iranian-backed convicted embezzler, Ahmed Chalabi. In 2003, the George W. Bush administration assumed that toppling Saddam would lead to stability rather than chaos when the U.S. military “shocked and awed” its way to Baghdad. In 2005, as the country descended into violence, Vice President Dick Cheney insisted that the insurgency was in its “last throes.”"
82,How to Prevent an Iranian Bomb,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/iran/how-prevent-iranian-bomb,How to Prevent an Iranian Bomb,"The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), reached by Iran, six other countries, and the European Union in Vienna in July, has sparked a heated political debate in the United States. Under the terms of the agreement, Iran has agreed to accept some temporary limits on its nuclear program in return for the lifting of the economic sanctions the international community imposed in response to that program. The Obama administration, a chief negotiator of the accord, argues that the deal will freeze and in some ways set back Iran’s march toward nuclear weapons while opening up the possibility of improving relations between the United States and the Islamic Republic, which have been bitterly hostile ever since the 1979 Iranian Revolution. The administration further contends that the agreement includes robust provisions for the international inspection of Iran’s nuclear facilities that will discourage and, if necessary, detect any Iranian cheating, triggering stiff penalties in response."
